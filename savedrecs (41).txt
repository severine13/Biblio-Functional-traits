AB Riparian habitats are transitional zones where strong environmental gradients shape community. To prevent flood risks and channel migration on managed rivers, civil engineering techniques have been widely used. Recently, ecological restoration of rivers has become a major issue. However, given the alteration of natural disturbance regimes induced by human infrastructures, the real added-value of these restoration actions is questionable. Thus, a major challenge is to better understand whether changes in abiotic conditions induced by human activity influence the response of plant communities to environmental gradients. Studying a highly degraded large river, we evaluated the effect of the elevation and soil texture gradients on plant functional composition and assessed whether human-mediated environment gradients, achieved through maintenance and restoration measures, shape community structure. In the summer of 2017, we sampled 17 geomorphic surfaces, mostly gravel bars, along the Rhone River and its tributaries that were either repeatedly cleared (brush clearing vs plowing), newly reprofiled or naturally rejuvenated by high flows. The results show shifts in trait values with elevation and convergence in plant traitswith increasing proportion of fine sediments. The co-occurrence of species with contrasting traits was higher in highly disturbed environments, revealing the importance of rejuvenation processes. However, the influence of both environmental gradients was mediated by human activity. For maintenancemeasures, plowingwas better able to promote species diversity and limited biotic homogenization along environmental gradients. Among the three geomorphic surfaces, naturally rejuvenated barswere themost stressful environments, hosting distinct functional assemblages, while communities on newly reprofiled banks were in the same ecological trajectories as repeatedly cleared bars. To promote an effective ecological restoration of riparian zones, (i) a greater variability of the minimum flow is needed, (ii) bedload transport restoration should be a priority and (iii) reprofiled banks should better mimic the landforms of natural river margins.

AB Examining the relative contribution of local environmental stressors and regional factors in structuring biological communities is essential for biodiversity conservation and environmental assessment, yet their relative roles for different community characterizations remain elusive. Here, we examined the responses of taxonomic and functional structures of stream macroinvertebrate communities to local and regional factors across a human-induced environmental gradient in the Han River Basin, one subtropical biodiversity hotspot in China. Our objectives were: 1) to examine the responses of traditional taxonomic measures and functional traits to anthropogenic disturbances; 2) to compare the relative importance of environmental versus spatial variables and catchment-scale versus reach-scale variables for the two community characterizations. We found that both species and trait compositions performed well in differentiating anthropogenic disturbances, indicating that both taxonomic and functional structures of macroinvertebrate communities were strongly altered by human activities. Particularly, some traits related to life history (e.g., voltinism), resilience and resistance (e.g., adult flying ability) are well suited for predicting changes of communities towards anthropogenic disturbances owing to their mechanistic relationship with environmental gradients. We found that environmental variables played more important roles than spatial effects in structuring both taxonomic and functional facets of macroinvertebrate communities. Environmental filtering was more important in determining functional than taxonomic structure, and the opposite was true for spatial effects. In terms of environmental variables, catchment land-uses played the primary role in determining taxonomic composition, whereas reach-scale variables related to local habitat heterogeneity were more influential for functional structure. Our study highlights the importance of employing metacommunity perspectives and different community characterizations in both theoretical and applied research. For stream bioassessment and management, we argue that the combination of taxonomic and functional characterizations of community should be implemented, as different facets of biological communities responded to different types of anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Microplastic (MP) pollution continues to proliferate in freshwater, marine and terrestrial environments, but with their biotic implications remaining poorly understood. Biotic interactions such as predation can profoundly influence ecosystem structuring, stability and functioning. However, we currently lack quantitative understandings of how trophic interaction strengths and associated behaviours are influenced by MP pollution, and how transference of MPs between trophic levels relates to consumptive traits. We also lack understanding of key life-history effects of MPs, for example, reproductive strategies such as oviposition. The present study examines the predatory ability of non-biting midge larvae, Chaoborus flavicans, towards larvae of Culex pipiens mosquitoes when the latter are exposed to MPs, using a functional response (FR) approach. Transfer of MPs occurred from larval mosquitoes to larval midges via predation. Microplastics transfer was significantly positively related to predation rates. Predation by C. flavicans followed a Type II FR, with average maximum feeding rates of 6.2 mosquito larvae per hour. These and other FR parameters (attack rates and handling times) were not significantly influenced by the presence of MPs. Further, C. pipiens adults did not avoid ovipositing in habitats with high concentrations of MPs. We thus demonstrate that MPs can move readily through freshwater food webs via biotic processes such as predation, and that uptake correlates strongly with consumption rates. Further, as MPs do not deter adult mosquitoes from ovipositing, our experiments reveal high potential for MP exposure and transference through ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Changes in land use, climate and flow diversion are key drivers of river flow regime change that may eventually affect freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem functions. However, our knowledge is limited on how the functional features of stream organisms vary along the gradient of hydrological disturbance (i.e. flow regime changes) and how flow regimes mediate the functional features in lowland streams. We analyzed the functional traits of benthic diatoms (unicellular siliceous algae) that are most sensitive and tolerant to flow regime changes along a nationwide scale of 246 sites in Denmark. We combined RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to explore the co-variation between hydrological variables (R table) and species traits (Q table), constrained by the relative abundance of each species (L table) as observed in each of the sampling sites. Further, we examine the relationships between functional features (i.e., functional redundancy and diversity) and hydrological variables by multivariate statistical analyses. Results show that species turnover with displacement of sensitive species by tolerant species was the dominating process in benthic diatom communities during high flow disturbances. Functional features, as indicated by functional diversity and redundancy indices, were mediated mainly by high and low flow magnitude. Median daily flow magnitude shows a consistent positive relationship with functional redundancy and richness indices indicating that larger streams are more resilient to flow perturbations. In addition flow regime changes are less important than median daily flow magnitude and show inconsistent correlation to functional features likely due to the interaction of multiple environmental stressors. Our study highlights the robustness of trait-based approaches for identifying flow regime changes in streams, and strongly suggests that biodiversity conservation and water resource management should focus on protecting natural base flow in headwater streams and generally reduce flow regulation for sustaining stream ecosystems under future global changes.

AB Although experiences with ecological restoration continue to accumulate, the effectiveness of restoration for biota remains debated. We complemented a traditional taxonomic analysis approach with information on 56 species traits to uncover the responses of 3 aquatic (fish, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes) and 2 terrestrial (carabid beetles, floodplain vegetation) biotic groups to 43 hydromorphological river restoration projects in Germany. All taxonomic groups responded positively to restoration, as shown by increased taxonomic richness (10-164%) and trait diversity (habitat, dispersal and mobility, size, form, life history, and feeding groups) (15-120%). Responses, however, were stronger for terrestrial than aquatic biota, and, contrary to our expectation, taxonomic responses were stronger than those of traits. Nevertheless, trait analysis provided mechanistic insights into the drivers of community change following restoration. Trait analysis for terrestrial biota indicated restoration success was likely enhanced by lateral connectivity and reestablishment of dynamic processes in the floodplain. The weaker response of aquatic biota suggests recovery was hindered by the persistence of stressors in the aquatic environment, such as degraded water quality, dispersal constraints, and insufficient hydromorphological change. Therefore, river restoration requires combined local- and regional-scale approaches to maximize the response of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Due to the contrasting responses of aquatic and terrestrial biota, the planning and assessment of river restoration outcomes should consider effects on both components of riverine landscapes.

AB Analysis of the biological traits (e.g., feeding mode and size) that control how organisms interact with their environment has been used to identify environmental drivers of, or impacts on, species and to explain the importance of biodiversity loss. Biological trait analysis (BTA) could also be used within risk-assessment frameworks or in conservation planning if one understands the groups of traits that predict the sensitivity of habitats or communities to specific human activities. Deriving sensitivities from BTA should extend sensitivity predictions to a variety of habitats, especially those in which it would be difficult to conduct experiments (e.g., due to depth or risk to human life) and to scales beyond the norm of most experiments. We used data on epibenthos, collected via video along transects at 27 sites in a relatively pristine region of the seafloor, to determine scales of natural spatial variability of derived sensitivities and the degree to which predictions of sensitivity differed among 3 stressors (extraction of species, sedimentation, and suspended sediments) or were affected by underlying community compositions. We used 3 metrics (weighted abundance, abundance of highly sensitive species, and number of highly sensitive species) to derive sensitivity to these stressors and simulated the ability of these metrics to detect a range of stressor intensities. Regardless of spatial patterns of sensitivities across the sampled area, BTA distinguished differences in sensitivity to different stressors. The BTA also successfully separated differences in community composition from differences in sensitivity to stressors. Conversely, the 3 metrics differed widely in their ability to detect simulated impacts and likely reflect underlying ecological processes, suggesting that use of multiple metrics would be informative for spatial planning and allocating conservation priorities. Our results suggest BTA could be used as a first step in strategic prioritization of protected areas and as an underlying layer for spatial planning.

AB Management decisions in conservation of threatened species require trading off social needs against biodiversity values, including the prioritization of conservation locations, i.e. where conservation efforts should take place. To improve conservation decisions for the thick-shelled river mussel, Unio crassus, a highly threatened temporary parasite on fish, we performed a field study on how mussel and host fish density (European bullhead, Cottus gobio, and common minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus) affect reproduction potential of the mussel at different sites along a river. We assumed that the proportions of gravid mussels would be higher at high mussel density, and result in enhanced glochidia (mussel larvae) encapsulation rates on fish. We also expected the highest glochidia density'a proxy for the potential number of recruits per stream area, assessed by multiplying glochidia encapsulation rates on fish by fish density, to occur at high mussel density sites. Such river sites, producing many offspring and conveying important conservation values, may thus be prioritized. However, contrary to our assumptions, higher glochidia density and higher proportions of gravid mussels occurred at lower density mussel sites. We also found that P. phoxinus had higher glochidia encapsulation rates than C. gobio, possibly related to species-specific behavioural and life-history traits. Even so, glochidia density was similar for both fish species, reflecting comparable ecological functions in hosts. The results of this study suggest that mussel and host fish densities should be considered along with glochidia density in conservation prioritization and management trade-offs.

AB This study aims to evaluate the anthropogenic pressure in the St. Lawrence River by assessing the relationships between chemical contamination of sediments and benthic community structure with the trait-based approach. Organic and inorganic contaminants as well as other sediment variables (sediment grain size, total organic carbon, nutrients, etc.) and benthic invertebrate assemblages were determined in 59 sites along the river. Biological and ecological traits of taxa were coded, taking into account regional dimate and ecosystem conditions. The aims of this study were to (1) describe the relationships between traits and macroinvertebrate taxa and identify homogeneous dusters of taxa with the same combinations of functional traits, (2) describe spatial patterns in traits of macroinvertebrates in the St. Lawrence River, (3) link trait-based metrics and site groups to sediment quality and (4) define a trait-based strategy for diagnosing the ecological quality of the St. Lawrence River. Seven groups of taxa sharing similar trait-category attributes were defined. Moreover, four groups of sites were identified using the 'K-mean' non-hierarchical clustering approach. The 'IndVal' method enabled us to specifically defined trait categories corresponding to site groups on the basis of their indicator value. The relative abundances of taxa from five functional groups significantly varied among site groups. For example, some indicator traits such as multivolline cycle, long life span, fixed dutches, tegumental respiration, asexual reproduction, and collector/gatherer feeding habit were associated to the most heavily polluted sites located in the Montreal harbour which showed the highest sediment concentrations in Pb. Zn and Cu. Three trait-based pressure-specific models were built, based on the random forest approach, for respectively (1) heavy metals. (2) BPCs and PAHs, and (3) TBTs occurring in the environment. These models could be applied to assess sediment quality using macroinvertebrate assemblages in a large Canadian river. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Abiotic stress shapes how communities assemble and support ecological functions. However, it remains unclear whether artificially increasing or decreasing stress levels would lead to communities assembling predictably along a single axis of variation or along multiple context-dependent trajectories of change. In response to stress intensity alterations, we hypothesize that a single trajectory of change occurs when trait-based assembly prevails, while multiple trajectories of change arise when dispersal-related processes modify colonization and trait-filtering dynamics. Hem, we tested these hypotheses using aquatic macroinvertebrates from rivers exposed to gradients of natural salinity and artificially diluted or salinized ion contents. Our results showed that trait-filtering was important in driving community assembly in natural and diluted rivers, while dispersal-related processes seemed to play a relevant role in response to salinization. Salinized rivers showed novel communities with different trait composition, while natural and diluted communities exhibited similar taxonomic and trait compositional patterns along the conductivity gradient. Our findings suggest that the artificial modification of chemical stressors can result in different biological communities, depending on the direction of the change (salinization or dilution), with trait-filtering, and organism dispersal and colonization dynamics having differential roles in community assembly. The approach presented here provides both empirical and conceptual insights that can help in anticipating the ecological effects of global change, especially for those stressors with both natural and anthropogenic origins.

AB With the increase in the number of introduced species each year, biological invasions are considered as one of the most important environmental problems for native biodiversity. In invaded habitats, the establishment of exotic plant species depends on the abiotic and biotic environment. Herbivores and neighboring plants (native or exotic) comprise an important part of the latter. Herbivores cause trophic and non-trophic damage to focal plants, which respond to herbivory by varying their different traits quantitatively (e.g., growth rate and biomass changes) and qualitatively (e.g., variation in morphological and chemical defenses strategies affecting plant palatability). Neighboring plant species also affect functional traits and the fitness of focal plant species, thus herbivore effects on a focal plant could also depend indirectly on the palatability and defensive traits of the neighboring species inside the community. Here, in a first step toward the integration of associational susceptibility/resistance theories in the field of ecological invasion, we performed a microcosm experiment to consider the effects of an exotic crayfish on the growth rate, morphological traits and damage level of three macrophytes (two exotic, one native) growing in pairwise combinations. We found that (i) the response to herbivore presence and to neighboring species identity seemed to be species specific, and (ii) crayfish enhance the fragmentation rate of the two exotic macrophytes Ludwigia grandiflora and Egeria densa in the presence of the native macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum, which could indirectly facilitate their invasion success. Indeed, fragmentation can increase dispersal abilities of the exotic macrophytes considered in this study as they are able to generate new plants from their fragments. However, our results showed that the interaction herbivore-neighbor species was hardly significant. Our paper presents some first results on associational resistance/susceptibility and lays the foundation for developing a general framework that combines plant community ecology and biological invasion ecology to explain invasive species success.

The macrophytes in genus Ottelia were featured for their broad leaves, which might consequently produce specialized functions that differed from other submerged species. To explore the potential ecological role of Ottelia, a field investigation was conducted on leaf traits in eight populations of Ottelia ranging from the southwestern Yunnan-Guizhou plateau to the southern Hainan island in China covering a distance of > 1,700 km. The eight populations included all the extant Ottelia species and varieties in China except the well-documented O. alismoides. Carbon-related traits [bicarbonate usage, photosynthetic characteristics, capability of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)], pigment content and parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence, morphology and mass of the leaves were determined. The different populations showed distinct functional traits of mature leaves; O. acuminata var. songmingensis had the thickest and longest leaf with CaCO3 precipitation on the both sides of the leaf, and O. cordata showed putative CAM activity with the highest diel acidity changes 12.5 mu equiv g(-1) FW. Our results indicated an important role of Ottelia populations in carbon cycling as the dominant species in karst freshwaters in China.

AB Wetland ecosystems are known to mitigate high nutrient loadings and thus can improve water quality and prevent potential biodiversity loss caused by eutrophication. Plant traits affect wetland processes directly through effects on accumulation or metabolization of substances, and indirectly by affecting microbial transformation processes in the soil. Understanding the causes and consequences of intraspecific variation in plant functional traits and associated ecosystem processes can aid applied ecological approaches such as wetland restoration and construction. Here we investigated molecular variation and phenotypic variation in response to three levels of nitrogen availability for a regional set of populations of the common wetland plant Juncus effusus. We asked whether trait expression reveals signatures of adaptive differentiation by comparing genetic differentiation in quantitative traits and neutral molecular markers (Q(ST)-F-ST comparisons) and relating trait variation to soil conditions of the plant's origin. Molecular analyses showed that samples clustered into three very distinct genetic lineages with strong population differentiation within and among lineages. Differentiation for quantitative traits was substantial but did not exceed neutral expectations when compared across treatments or for each treatment and lineage separately. However, variation in trait expression could be explained by local soil environmental conditions of sample origin, e.g. for aboveground carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratios, suggesting adaptive differentiation to contribute to trait expression even at regional level.

AB Quantifying changes in functional diversity, the facet of biodiversity accounting for the biological features of organisms, has been advocated as one of the most integrative ways to unravel how communities are affected by human-induced perturbations. The present study assessed how functional diversity patterns varied among communities that differed in the degree to which non-native species dominated the community in temperate lake fish communities and whether accounting for intraspecific functional variability could provide a better understanding of the variation of functional diversity across communities. Four functional diversity indices were computed for 18 temperate lake fish communities along a gradient of non-native fish dominance using morphological functional traits assessed for each life-stage within each species. First, we showed that intraspecific variability in functional traits was high and comparable to interspecific variability. Second, we found that non-native fish were functionally distinct from native fish. Finally, we demonstrated that there was a significant relationship between functional diversity and the degree to which non-native fish currently dominated the community and that this association could be better detected when accounting for intraspecific functional variability. These findings highlighted the importance of incorporating intraspecific variability to better quantify the variation of functional diversity patterns in communities facing human-induced perturbations.

AB Vulnerability to toxic alien prey varies among native predator species, depending on their toxin resistance. Although foraging traits relating to the intake of prey are also likely to influence predator vulnerability to toxic alien prey, these traits have received little attention. To address this issue, we studied the toxic impacts of an alien prey species (Bufo japonicus formosus toad hatchlings) on a carnivorous and an omnivorous native amphibian species (Hynobius retardatus salamander larvae and Rana pirica frog tadpoles, respectively) that both feed on alien B. japonicus formosus toad hatchlings. First, we designed a mesocosm and an aquarium experiment to evaluate the impact of B. japonicus formosus on the survival of native amphibians under various alien prey densities and predation regimes. Second, we performed several additional laboratory experiments to clarify specific processes of native amphibian mortality in the presence of the alien B. japonicus formosus toad hatchlings. We found that both native amphibian species were impacted by the alien B. japonicus formosus toad hatchlings. Interestingly, R. pirica frog tadpoles were more affected than H. retardatus salamander larvae, partly due to their lower toxin resistance and their higher toad consumption rate. Most importantly, omnivorous foraging traits (i.e., food sharing and carcass consumption) demonstrated by R. pirica frog tadpoles, but not by the strictly carnivorous H. retardatus salamander larvae, rendered the former particularly vulnerable to the toxic B. japonicus formosus toad hatchlings. This is the first study suggesting that species-specific foraging traits such as food-sharing and carcass consumption can determine predator vulnerability to toxic alien prey. This study emphasises the importance of investigating a wider array of predator traits as factors that determine their vulnerability to toxic alien prey. By doing so, we can understand what types of native species are strongly impacted by toxic alien prey and predict the ecological consequences of toxic species invasion.

AB How ecosystem functioning changes with microbial communities remains an open question in natural ecosystems. Both present-day environmental conditions and historical events, such as past differences in dispersal, can have a greater influence over ecosystem function than the diversity or abundance of both taxa and genes. Here, we estimated how individual and interactive effects of microbial community structure defined by diversity and abundance, present-day environmental conditions, and an indicator of historical legacies influenced ecosystem functioning in lake sediments. We studied sediments because they have strong gradients in all three of these ecosystem properties and deliver important functions worldwide. By characterizing bacterial community composition and functional traits at eight sites fed by discrete and contrasting catchments, we found that taxonomic diversity and the normalized abundance of oxidase-encoding genes explained as much variation in CO2 production as present-day gradients of pH and organic matter quantity and quality. Functional gene diversity was not linked to CO2 production rates. Surprisingly, the effects of taxonomic diversity and normalized oxidase abundance in the model predicting CO2 production were attributable to site-level differences in bacterial communities unrelated to the present-day environment, suggesting that colonization history rather than habitat-based filtering indirectly influenced ecosystem functioning. Our findings add to limited evidence that biodiversity and gene abundance explain patterns of microbiome functioning in nature. Yet we highlight among the first time how these relationships depend directly on present-day environmental conditions and indirectly on historical legacies, and so need to be contextualized with these other ecosystem properties.

AB The great scallop, Pecten maximus, presents a strong variability of growth and reproductive patterns along its spatial distribution range. Such differences in life history traits result from complex interactions between organisms and environmental conditions that can be apprehended through the study of energy dynamics. As the determination of accurate food proxy can be a limitation for modeling bioenergetic, recent work by Lavaud et al. (accepted, this issue), based on the DEB theory, provided a new approach consisting of using temperature and growth time series to reconstruct the required assimilated energy to support observed growth. In this study we present an application of this method to growth trajectories of the great scallop P. maxims used to elucidate: (1) life history traits patterns and (2) the choice of food availability proxies. The inverted DEB model was used to reconstruct the functional response (f) for different age classes of P. maximus in 10 locations of its spatial distribution range. We especially explored the patterns of reconstructed f along latitudinal and bathymetric gradients. Average reconstructed f as well as its maximum value were found to increase with latitude. The variability off, although increasing, did not show a significant relationship with the geographical position. Along the bathymetric gradient strong positive relationships were found between the mean f or its variability and depth. Ontogeny had low effect on the reconstructed f. Furthermore, as the inverted DEB model allows the reconstruction of physiological variables and energy fluxes, we explored the potential differences in reserve and maintenance fluxes dynamics from great scallops living in these contrasting environments. For one of the study sites, comparisons of f with field measurements of 11 food indicators (chlorophyll-a from the pelagic/benthic domains, phytoplankton cell counts, etc.) highlighted the complexity of the functional response and the diet of P. maximus. Pelagic or benthic phytoplankton biovolume, diatoms and dinoflagellates counts and chlorophyll-a were found to be the major contributors to the variability of f. Results suggest that although assimilation is best described by a combination of indicators, chlorophyll-a remains a good enough indicator of food availability for great scallops and bivalves in general.

AB Assessing species' vulnerability to climate change is a prerequisite for developing effective strategies to conserve them. The last three decades have seen exponential growth in the number of studies evaluating how, how much, why, when, and where species will be impacted by climate change. We provide an overview of the rapidly developing field of climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) and describe key concepts, terms, steps and considerations. We stress the importance of identifying the full range of pressures, impacts and their associated mechanisms that species face and using this as a basis for selecting the appropriate assessment approaches for quantifying vulnerability. We outline four CCVA assessment approaches, namely trait-based, correlative, mechanistic and combined approaches and discuss their use. Since any assessment can deliver unreliable or even misleading results when incorrect data and parameters are applied, we discuss finding, selecting, and applying input data and provide examples of open-access resources. Because rare, small-range, and declining-range species are often of particular conservation concern while also posing significant challenges for CCVA, we describe alternative ways to assess them. We also describe how CCVAs can be used to inform IUCN Red List assessments of extinction risk. Finally, we suggest future directions in this field and propose areas where research efforts may be particularly valuable.

AB Functional traits are increasingly being used to predict extinction risks and range shifts under long-term climate change scenarios, but have rarely been used to study vulnerability to extreme climatic events, such as supraseasonal droughts. In streams, drought intensification can cross thresholds of habitat loss, where marginal changes in environmental conditions trigger disproportionate biotic responses. However, these thresholds have been studied only from a structural perspective, and the existence of functional nonlinearity remains unknown. We explored trends in invertebrate community functional traits along a gradient of drought intensity, simulated over 18 months, using mesocosms analogous to lowland headwater streams. We modelled the responses of 16 traits based on a priori predictions of trait filtering by drought, and also examined the responses of trait profile groups (TPGs) identified via hierarchical cluster analysis. As responses to drought intensification were both linear and nonlinear, generalized additive models (GAMs) were chosen to model response curves, with the slopes of fitted splines used to detect functional thresholds during drought. Drought triggered significant responses in 12 (75%) of the a priori-selected traits. Behavioural traits describing movement (dispersal, locomotion) and diet were sensitive to moderate-intensity drought, as channels fragmented into isolated pools. By comparison, morphological and physiological traits showed little response until surface water was lost, at which point we observed sudden shifts in body size, respiration mode and thermal tolerance. Responses varied widely among TPGs, ranging from population collapses of non-aerial dispersers as channels fragmented to irruptions of small, eurythermic dietary generalists upon extreme dewatering. Our study demonstrates for the first time that relatively small changes in drought intensity can trigger disproportionately large functional shifts in stream communities, suggesting that traits-based approaches could be particularly useful for diagnosing catastrophic ecological responses to global change.

AB Two closely related alien submerged aquatic plants were introduced into Europe. The new invader (Elodea nuttallii) gradually displaced E. canadensis even at sites where the latter was well established. The aim of the study was to evaluate the combined effects of environmental factors on several phenotypic characteristics of the two Elodea species, and to relate these phenotypic characteristics to the invasion success of E. nuttallii over E. canadensis. In a factorial design, Elodea plants were grown in aquaria containing five different nitrogen concentrations and incubated at five different light intensities. We used six functional traits (apical shoot RGR), total shoot RGR, relative elongation, root length, lateral spread, branching degree) to measure the environmental response of the species. We calculated plasticity indices to express the phenotypic differences between species. Light and nitrogen jointly triggered the development of phenotypic characteristics that make E. nuttallii a more successful invader in eutrophic waters than E. canadensis. The stronger invader showed a wider range of phenotypic plasticity. The apical elongation was the main difference between the two species, with E. nuttallii being more than two times longer than E. canadensis. E. canadensis formed dense side shoots even under high shade and low nitrogen levels, whereas E. nuttallii required higher light and nitrogen levels. We found that under more eutrophic conditions, E. nuttallii reach the water surface sooner than E. canadensis and through intensive branching outcompetes all other plants including E. canadensis. Our findings support the theory that more successful invaders have wider phenotypic plasticity.

AB The Alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, presently has two distinct life history variants, the anadromous ancestral type, and a derived landlocked freshwater type. In accordance with their variation in life history, landlocked Alewives have evolved dissimilar morphologies and ecological traits relative to the anadromous type, and as a result, their functional roles within ecosystems have changed. This study tests the prediction that hosts with an altered life history and ecosystem residency, like the landlocked Alewives would have lower rates of parasitism, which would result in a lower diversity and abundance of macroparasites compared to the anadromous variant. We compared parasite species richness and abundance between landlocked (collected from a lake in New Jersey) and anadromous Alewives (collected from river and ocean environments). The landlocked Alewives were infected with only 2 parasite species and overall parasite abundance was low in this population, while the anadromous Alewives harbored 7 parasite species, which formed distinct communities depending on host stage. Overall, this study suggests there was a loss of native parasites within landlocked Alewives and supports the idea that these populations of Alewives experience lower parasite pressure than their anadromous conspecifics.

AB The natural hydrologic processes that create and maintain the diversity of aquatic and riparian habitats along the World's streams and rivers have been profoundly altered by humans. Diversion of surface water to support production agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions has degraded ecosystems but also created potential habitat along and in canals specifically designed to transport water. The prevalence of canals and the immense amount of water used for agriculture have created these new artificial stream systems. This study demonstrates the potential for irrigation canals to support riparian and aquatic communities similar to natural streams in urban/residential and agricultural landscapes. We examined the hydrological and ecological characteristics of streams and irrigation canals in urban and agricultural landscapes in northeastern Colorado, typical of regions dominated by irrigation-supported agriculture. Flow patterns in canals depended on their size and had a range of patterns with potential ecological consequences such as rapidly rising and falling water stage, intermittent dry periods, and delayed peak and base flows compared to natural streams. Despite these hydrologic differences, the taxonomic and functional composition of riparian plant and aquatic macroinvertebrate communities indicated that ecological similarities exist between streams and canals, but are dependent, in part, on their landscape setting with stronger similarities in agricultural areas. We also tested the influence of characterizing taxa by functional groups using physiology, ecology and life history traits to explore attributes of habitats including woody canopy structure and water quality. We used a Habitat Quality Index (HQI) that combined physical and biological measures into a single index. Streams scored higher on average within agriculture and urban/residential settings compared to canals; however, one third of urban canals scored above the average of agricultural streams. This multidisciplinary study shows that irrigation canals can be valuable riparian and aquatic habitat, especially in regions with severely degraded streams. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB BackgroundSeminal plasma proteins are associated with successful fertilization. However, their evolutionary correlation with fertilization mechanisms remains unclear. Cichlids from Lake Tanganyika show a variety-rich spawning behavior that is associated with the transfer of the sperm to the egg for fertilization. One of these behaviors, called oral fertilization, emerged during their speciation. In oral fertilization, females nuzzle the milt from male genitalia and pick up the released eggs in their mouths, which are then fertilized inside the oral cavity. Thus, the success of the fertilization is dependent on the retention of sperm in the oral cavity during spawning. Sperm aggregation and immobilization in viscous seminal plasma may help retain the sperm inside the oral cavity, which ultimately determines the success of the fertilization. Seminal plasma glycoprotein 120 (SPP120) is one of the major seminal plasma proteins present in cichlids. SPP120 has been implicated to immobilize sperm and increase the milt viscosity. However, the functional linkage between oral fertilization and seminal plasma proteins has not been investigated.ResultsDuring trials of simulated oral fertilization, it was observed that milt viscosity contributed to fertilization success by facilitating longer retention of the milt inside the mouth during spawning. Glycosylation of SPP120 was associated with high milt viscosity. Its glycosylation was specifically present in the milt of cichlid species exhibiting oral fertilization. Moreover, recombinant SPP120 from several the oral fertilization species strongly immobilized/aggregated sperm. Therefore, the functions of SPP120 (immobilization/aggregation and its glycosylation) may contribute to success of oral fertilization, and these functions of SPP120 are more prominent in oral fertilization species. In addition, comparative phylogenetic analyses showed a positive evolutionary correlation between SPP120 function and oral fertilization. Hence, these evolutions may have occurred to keep up with the transition in the mode of fertilization. In addition, rapid evolution in the molecular sequence might be associated with functional modifications of SPP120.ConclusionThese results suggest that SPP120 might be associated with oral fertilization. In other words, reproductive traits that define the interaction between sperms and eggs could be the evolutionary selective force that cause the rapid functional modification of the fertilization-related reproductive protein, SPP120.

AB Functional trait theory provides a mechanistic framework to understand change in community composition and community assembly through time and space. Despite this, trait-based approaches have seldom been used in ecological restoration. Succession theory predicts that habitat complexity and resource availability will increase with restoration time, leading to increased functional dissimilarity among coexisting species. However, in the case of tidal marsh restoration, it is not clear whether reestablishing the harsh abiotic conditions typical of estuaries will initiate successional trajectories. We investigated monotonic changes in the functional structure of fish communities and shifts in assembly mechanisms, with tidal restoration time. A five-level gradient of 'intertidal habitat naturalness' was constructed from a set of artificialized (dyked), restored (with different ages) and natural intertidal sites, and used as a surrogate for restoration progress. The fish ecophases were described using ten functional traits related to food acquisition and swimming ability. The trends in six functional dimensions (identity, richness, evenness, dispersion, originality and specialization) were investigated along the naturalness gradient. Consistenly with succession theory, functional specialization, dispersion and, less markedly, richness increased with intertidal naturalness meaning that restored and natural intertidal habitats supplied fish with specific foraging and dwelling conditions absent from dyked marshes. Community assembly patterns varied with respect to traits and differed at both ends of the naturalness gradient. Dyked marshes were more affected by trait convergence possibly due to limiting resources. Environmental filtering was detected all along the naturalness gradient although the traits affected varied depending on the naturalness level of habitats. Environmental filtering tended to decrease in restored and natural intertidal habitats. Increased naturalness restored the attractivity of benthic habitats as feeding or settling grounds, promoted shelter-seeking vs. free-swimming strategists and favoured ecophases with carnivorous diets, feeding on microinvertebrates and benthic low-mobility macroinvertebrates. Approaches based on functional trait diversity have the potential to question and refine the theoretical frame of ecological restoration and to assist managers in their efforts to restore tidal wetlands.

AB Our study presents a revision of the structural characteristics of the soft-bottom benthic communities in the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) and provides, for the first time, an insight into their functional characteristics. Compared to previous research, the dataset expanded considerably on a spatial and temporal scale (1994-2012). Five communities were identified, each with their own structural characteristics, indicator species, sediment properties and spatial distribution. The offshore area was dominated by the Hesionura elongata community (formerly Ophelia borealis), and although previously described by low diversity and abundance, this study shows that this community has the second highest sample diversity and moderate densities. Also, a new community, the Magelona-Ensis leei community, was found in very shallow water and characterized by low diversity and the dominance of the non-indigenous species E. leei. The structural characteristics and spatial distribution of the previously described Limecola balthica, Abra alba and Nephtys cirrosa community remained largely unchanged. Though structurally distinct, the communities overlap in some of their functional attributes. Analysis of biological traits revealed that in the coarser permeable sands, both the N. cirrosa and H. elongata community harbor more free living mobile individuals, causing diffusive mixing. The finer sand (A. alba, Magelona- Ensis leei) and muddy (L. balthica) communities hold more sessile, tube building and burrow dwelling species. Apart from diffusive mixing, sediment reworking in these finer sands occurs by surface deposition and downward convection. In combination with higher densities and biomass, this results in a higher bioturbation potential (BPc) for the Abra alba and Magelona-Ensis leei community. Finally, measures for functional diversity and redundancy were calculated, and were also highest in the Abra alba and Hesionura elongata community, thus demonstrating the importance of both communities for conservation purposes from a structural as well as a functional perspective. The analyses revealed that even in well-studied areas new data give new insights, with important consequences for management. Our study forms a benchmark for future ecosystem health status assessments in the framework of international and national nature management obligations such as the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Habitats Directive and the Marine Spatial Planning Directive.

   VULNERABILITY; REVEALS; IMPACT; CONSEQUENCES
AB The effects of environmental change on biodiversity are still poorly understood. In particular, the consequences of shifts in species composition for marine ecosystem function are largely unknown. Here we assess the loss of functional diversity, i.e. the range of species biological traits, in benthic marine communities exposed to ocean acidification (OA) by using natural CO2 vent systems. We found that functional richness is greatly reduced with acidification, and that functional loss is more pronounced than the corresponding decrease in taxonomic diversity. In acidified conditions, most organisms accounted for a few functional entities (i.e. unique combination of functional traits), resulting in low functional redundancy. These results suggest that functional richness is not buffered by functional redundancy under OA, even in highly diverse assemblages, such as rocky benthic communities.

TI A high-throughput and open-source platform for embryo phenomics
SO PLOS BIOLOGY
DT Article
ID IMAGE
AB Phenomics has the potential to facilitate significant advances in biology but requires the development of high-throughput technologies capable of generating and analysing high-dimensional data. There are significant challenges associated with building such technologies, not least those required for investigating dynamic processes such as embryonic development, during which high rates of temporal, spatial, and functional change are inherently difficult to capture. Here, we present EmbryoPhenomics, an accessible high-throughput platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos comprising an Open-source Video Microscope (OpenVIM) that produces high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under tightly controlled environmental conditions. These videos are then analysed by the Python package Embryo Computer Vision (EmbryoCV), which extracts phenomic data for morphological, physiological, behavioural, and proxy traits during the process of embryonic development. We demonstrate the broad-scale applicability of EmbryoPhenomics in a series of experiments assessing chronic, acute, and multistressor responses to environmental change (temperature and salinity) in >30 million images of >600 embryos of two species with markedly different patterns of development-the pond snail Radix balthica and the marine amphipod Orchestia gammarellus. The challenge of phenomics is significant but so too are the rewards, and it is particularly relevant to the urgent task of assessing complex organismal responses to current rates of environmental change. EmbryoPhenomics can acquire and process data capturing functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest, most dynamic life stages and is potentially game changing for those interested in studying development and phenomics more widely.

AB The evolution of body shape reflects both the ecological factors structuring organismal diversity as well as an organism's underlying anatomy. For instance, body depth in fishes is thought to determine their susceptibility to predators, attractiveness to mates, as well as swimming performance. However, the internal anatomy influencing diversification of body depth has not been extensively examined, and changes in body depth could arise as a by-product of functional changes in other anatomical structures. Using an improved phylogenetic hypothesis for a diverse set of Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, we tested the evolutionary association between body depth and the height of the pectoral girdle. To refine the functional importance of the observed substantial correlation, we also tested the coevolution of pectoral girdle height and pectoral fin area. The extensive coevolution of these traits suggests body depth in fishes like the Lake Malawi cichlids could diverge simply as a by-product of being tightly linked to ecomorphological divergence in other functional morphological structures like the pectoral fins.

AB Rarity and life history traits inform multiple dimensions of intrinsic risk to climate and environmental change and can help systematically identify at-risk species. We quantified relative geographic rarity (area of occupancy), climate niche breadth, and life history traits for 114 freshwater fishes, amphibians, and reptiles in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Our approach leveraged presence-only, publicly available data and traits-based inference to evaluate area of occupancy, climate sensitivity (i.e., climate niche breadth), and a Rarity and Climate Sensitivity (RCS) index of all species across multiple geographic extents, grain sizes, and data types. The RCS index was relatively stable across extents, grains, and data types, with climate sensitivity differentiating species with otherwise similar areas of occupancy. We also found that species with sensitivity-associated traits (e.g., long generation time, low fecundity) were not necessarily the same species identified as at-risk with geographical approaches (small range size, small climate niche breadth). Many multispecies assessments using coarse-scale data (e.g., entire range maps or convex-hull approaches) often focus on a single dimension of intrinsic risk; others rely on data-intensive models only applicable to a few well-studied species. What remains is a need for an approach that enables multispecies, multidimensional assessment efforts. This is particularly true at regional scales, where management needs require assessments that are intermediate to coarse- and fine-scale approaches. We demonstrate that by considering multiple dimensions of intrinsic risk to climate change (range size, climate sensitivity, and traits), site-specific locality data may offer a pathway for ensuring vulnerable, understudied species do not go overlooked in conservation.

AB Land use change is one of the major factors impacting freshwater biodiversity. Afforestation could convert new lands from agriculture or urban land uses to reduce erosion and lead to landscape alterations and biodiversity changes. Here, we examined the changes in the three facets of macroinvertebrate alpha diversity (i.e., taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity) and further explored possible mechanisms driving their variations before (2007) and after (2016) afforestation along the undammed Chishui River, the core of the National Nature Reserve of Rare and Endemic Fishes in the Upper Yangtze River. We found that taxonomic diversity measures (e.g., species richness, Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson index) increased but all measures of functional diversity (e.g., FRic, FEve, FDiv, and RaoQ) and phylogenetic diversity (e.g., indices of taxonomic distinctness) exhibited stability after the afforestation practice. We also found that only significant taxonomic diversity variation was detected and it showed a relationship to alterations of land use rather than local environmental condition changes across the 10-year afforestation practice. Moreover, hydrology and nutrients levels showed changes after afforestation, but these changes had no effect on the biodiversity changes based on multiple linear regression models. In each survey, the three facets of alpha diversity were significantly explained by natural physical factors and showed inconsistent responses to these underlying environmental variables. In addition, the biodiversity-environment relationships remained stable before and after afforestation, indicating that the inherent mechanisms that drive macroinvertebrate community variation have not changed. Our findings highlight that different alpha diversity measures of lotic macroinvertebrates provide different information about biodiversity and respond differently to various environmental variables. Thus, it is necessary to integrate them into one framework when applying routine monitoring, assessment, and conservation procedures based on lotic macroinvertebrates.

AB Plant roots in lakeshore areas can directly determine the survival of the aboveground plant parts. However, most current studies are focused on the aerial shoots, and less attention has been paid to the functions of the roots. In order to evaluate the effects of water level fluctuations (WLFs) on root architectural and morphological traits of plants in lakeshore areas, field investigations were conducted seasonally in three subtropical floodplain lakes with different types of WLFs. The results showed that both the pH and moisture contents of the soils were significantly different in all seasons among the three lakes, while the total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the soils only showed significant differences in certain seasons. Significant differences were also found in the two architectural trait parameters (root length density and root branching number) and three morphological trait parameters (root tissue density, root surface area, and root volume), all of which (except for root tissue density) were highest in the Dahuchi lake that experiences intermittent WLFs, and lowest in the Chaohu Lake with reservoir-like WLFs. With increasing lakeshore elevation gradients, we found that root length density, root branching number, root surface area, and root volume in the three lakes changed significantly, and all these root trait parameters increased first and then decreased. However, no significant differences were found for the above four root traits in the three lakes over the different seasons. Spearman correlation analyses indicated that both the hydrological and physicochemical factors were strongly correlated with the architectural and morphological root trait parameters, and the duration of submergence (duration) was the most important factor, judging from the correlation coefficients (R). The results of stepwise multiple regression further indicated the duration was the key factor affecting plant root traits. Based on the results of this study, we suggest that the WLFs in reservoir-like lakes should be changed in order to improve the ecological functions of the lakeshore.

AB Disruption of movement patterns due to alterations in habitat connectivity is a pervasive effect of humans on animal populations. In many terrestrial and aquatic systems, there is increasing tension between the need to simultaneously allow passage of some species while blocking the passage of other species. We explore the ecological basis for selective fragmentation of riverine systems where the need to restrict movements of invasive species conflicts with the need to allow passage of species of commercial, recreational, or conservation concern. We develop a trait-based framework for selective fish passage based on understanding the types of movements displayed by fishes and the role of ecological filters in determining the spatial distributions of fishes. We then synthesize information on trait-based mechanisms involved with these filters to create a multidimensional niche space based on attributes such as physical capabilities, body morphology, sensory capabilities, behavior, and movement phenology. Following this, we review how these mechanisms have been applied to achieve selective fish passage across anthropogenic barriers. To date, trap-and-sort or capture-translocation efforts provide the best options for movement filters that are completely species selective, but these methods are hampered by the continual, high cost of manual sorting. Other less effective methods of selective passage risk collateral damage in the form of lower or higher than desired levels of passage. Fruitful areas for future work include using combinations of ecological and behavioral traits to passively segregate species; using taxon-specific chemical or auditory cues to direct unwanted species away from passageways and into physical or ecological traps while attracting desirable species to passageways; and developing automated sorting mechanisms based on fish recognition systems. The trait-based approach proposed for fish could serve as a template for selective fragmentation in other ecological systems.

AB ContextIn agricultural landscapes, riparian forests are used as a management tool to protect stream ecosystems from agricultural activities. However, the ability of managers to target stream protection actions is limited by incomplete knowledge of scale-specific effects of agriculture in riparian corridor and catchment areas.ObjectivesWe evaluated scale-specific effects of agricultural cover in riparian corridor and catchment areas on stream benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) communities to develop cover targets for agricultural landscapes.MethodsSixty-eight streams assigned to three experimental treatments (Forested Riparian, Agricultural Riparian, Agricultural Catchment) were sampled for BMIs. Ordination and segmented regression were used to assess impacts of agriculture on BMI communities and detect thresholds for BMI community metrics.ResultsBMI communities were not associated with catchment agricultural cover where the riparian corridor was forested, but were associated with variation in catchment agriculture where riparian forests had been converted to agriculture. Trait-based metrics showed threshold responses at greater than 70% agricultural cover in the catchment. Increasing agriculture in the riparian corridor was associated with less diverse and more tolerant BMI communities. Eight metrics exhibited threshold responses ranging from 45 to 75% agriculture in the riparian corridor.ConclusionsRiparian forest effectively buffered streams from agricultural activity even where catchment agriculture exceeds 80%. We recommend managers prioritize protection of forested riparian corridors and that restore riparian corridors where agricultural cover is near identified thresholds be a secondary priority. Adoption of catchment management actions should be effective where the riparian corridor has been converted to agriculture.

AB The diversity of phytoplankton traits provides a powerful means of addressing ecological questions and can be adopted to simplify and predict the community structure and the function of the multiple environmental filters that operate in the different ecosystems. We evaluated the response of phytoplankton functional groups in samples from two subtropical rivers, identifying the main environmental filters associated with the presence of the different groups and their functional traits during a seasonal cycle. Using multivariate analysis, we found environmental dissimilarity that was predicted by the presence of different functional groups (FGs) in the two rivers. Six FGs were recorded: J (chlorophyceans chlorococcales), M (colonial cyanobacteria), N (desmids), W1 (euglenophyceans), X2 (flagellated unicellular chlorophyceans) and F (flagellated colonial chlorophyceans). The FGs J, M and N were exclusive to Cascavel River, while X2 and F were exclusive to Quati River. The FG W1 was recorded in both rivers; however, its greatest contribution was in Quati River. Thus, the FGs reflected the environmental dissimilarity, mainly related to the conditions of water flux, conductivity, light availability and depth of the environments. Based on these results, the functional groups are considered to provide a relevant tool in phytoplankton ecology, offering a practical means of investigating the relationship between phytoplankton and ecosystem functioning, and contributing to the management and conservation of biodiversity in lotic environments.

AB Climatic extremes are becoming more frequent and intense across much of the globe, potentially transforming the biodiversity and functioning of affected ecosystems. In freshwaters, hydrological extremes such as drought can regulate beta diversity, acting as powerful environmental filters to dictate the complement of species and functional traits found at local and landscape scales. New methods that enable beta diversity and its functional equivalent to be partitioned into turnover (replacement of species/functions) and nestedness-resultant (gain/loss of species/functions) components may offer novel insights into the parallel impacts of drought on ecosystem structure and function. Using a series of artificial channels (mesocosms) designed to mimic perennial headwater streams, we experimentally manipulated streamflows to simulate a gradient of drought intensity. We then modelled taxonomic and functional turnover and nestedness of macroinvertebrate communities along this gradient, validating direct gradient approaches (bootstrapping, Mantel tests) against null models of nestedness. Drought intensification produced significant environmental distance decay trends (i.e. communities became increasingly taxonomically and functionally dissimilar the more differentially disturbed by drought they were). Taxonomic distance decay was primarily driven by turnover, while the functional trend reflected a combination of richness differences and turnover at different points along the gradient. Taxonomic and functional distance decay slopes were not significantly different, implying that communities were functionally vulnerable to drying. The increased frequency and intensity of droughts predicted under most climate change scenarios could thus profoundly modify not only the structure of running water invertebrate communities, but also the ecosystem functions they underpin.

AB Species' distributions are influenced by abiotic and biotic factors but direct comparison of their relative importance is difficult, particularly when working with complex, multi-species datasets. Here, we compare the relative effects of hydrology, physical habitat, and co-occurring fish functional traits on the contemporary (1950-1990) distribution of the American eel Anguilla rostrata in six Mid-Atlantic (USA) rivers. To do so, we implement a null model approach that compares conditions at sites of known American eel presence to a random sample of sites throughout a broader landscape, allowing us to identify variables that may have the strongest influences on American eel distribution. Results suggest that, within this subset of the American eel's geographic range, the functional characteristics of locally co-occurring fishes and habitat fragmentation by dams may have the strongest influences on American eel distribution, compared to other predictor variables included in the analysis. Given the widespread distribution and complex biology of this species, we caution that our results may not apply to all American eel subpopulations or life stages. Nonetheless, the observed importance of co-occurring fish functional traits may inform American eel conservation and, more generally, provide a means to incorporate biotic influences in research on species' distributions.

AB Aim Understanding variation in biodiversity typically requires consideration of factors operating at different spatial scales. Recently, ecologists and biogeographers have recognized the need of analysing ecological communities in the light of multiple facets including not only species-level information but also functional and phylogenetic approaches to improve our understanding of the relative contribution of processes shaping biodiversity. Here, our aim was to disentangle the relative importance of environmental variables measured at multiple levels (i.e., local, catchment, climate, and spatial variables) influencing variation in macroinvertebrate beta diversity facets (i.e., species, traits, and phylogeny) and their components (i.e., replacement and abundance difference) in boreal streams. Taxon Location Aquatic macroinvertebrates Western Finland Methods Results A total of 105 streams were sampled in western Finland, encompassing a geographical extent over 500 km. We analysed variation in the different beta diversity facets and components using distance-based redundancy analysis and associated variation partitioning procedures. We modelled spatial structures using distance-based Moran eigenvector maps. We found that the relative influence of explanatory variables on each diversity facet and component revealed relatively similar patterns. Our main finding was that local environmental and spatial variables generally contributed most to the total explained variability in all facets and components of beta diversity, whereas catchment and climate variables explained less variation in the beta diversity facets at the spatial scale considered in this study. Main conclusions Different facets of beta diversity were mainly influenced by local environmental variables and spatial structuring, likely acting through deterministic and stochastic pathways respectively. Identifying the ecological variables and mechanisms that drive variation in beta diversity may be used to guide the conservation and restoration efforts for biodiversity under global change.

AB Demersal and benthivorous fish depend on prey availability in benthic habitats for their diet. Prey availability may in turn be affected by bottom trawling. Our study attempted to link the prey consumed by fish directly to those available in the benthic environment. We test the hypothesis that bottom trawling significantly affected the trait composition of fish diets with a strong link to benthic habitats. Stomach content data were analysed for seven demersal and benthivorous fish species in the southern and central North Sea and were related to habitat fauna collected by grab and epi-benthic trawl data across the same spatial extent. Biological trait analysis was used to avoid taxonomic bias in large-scale comparisons across habitats and to quantify the effect of bottom trawling, which tends to shift prey diversity in favour of small, opportunistic and short-lived species and traits. The diets of two demersal omnivores (whiting, Merlangius merlangus and Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua) and two opportunistic benthivores (haddock, Melanograrnmus aegiefinus and long-rough dab, Hippoglossoides platessoides) did not appear to reflect either infaunal or epifaunal traits that were abundant in the benthic environment. The diets of European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and Dover sole (Solea soled), however, showed strong links with infaunal prey trait composition in shallow sand to muddy sand habitats located in the eastern North Sea and the Dogger Bank. Such strong links were also observed for the diets of Common dab (Limanda limanda) and plaice in similar habitats in deeper waters. Plaice targeted small to medium sized infaunal burrowers and deeper dwelling infaunal species. Its diet was significantly affected by bottom trawling, which caused a reduction in prey biomass in their stomachs rather than a shift in trait composition. Our study showed that the diets of benthivorous fish across large spatial scales are strongly linked with the prey trait availability in their benthic habitats and that bottom trawling significantly affected the diet of plaice, a species with strong habitat-diet associations.

AB Diversity of microbial organisms is linked to global climatic gradients. The genus Phytophthora includes both aquatic and terrestrial plant pathogenic species that display a large variation of functional traits. The extent to which the physical environment (water or soil) modulates the interaction of microorganisms with climate is unknown. Here, we explored the main environmental drivers of diversity and functional trait composition of Phytophthora communities. Communities were obtained by a novel metabarcoding setup based on PacBio sequencing of river filtrates in 96 river sites along a geographical gradient. Species were classified as terrestrial or aquatic based on their phylogenetic Glade. Overall, terrestrial and aquatic species showed contrasting patterns of diversity. For terrestrial species, precipitation was a stronger driver than temperature, and diversity and functional diversity decreased with decreasing temperature and precipitation. In cold and dry areas, the dominant species formed resistant structures and had a low optimum temperature. By contrast, for aquatic species, temperature and water chemistry were the strongest drivers, and diversity increased with decreasing temperature and precipitation. Within the same area, environmental filtering affected terrestrial species more strongly than aquatic species (20% versus 3% of the studied communities, respectively). Our results highlight the importance of functional traits and the physical environment in which microorganisms develop their life cycle when predicting their distribution under changing climatic conditions. Temperature and rainfall may be buffered differently by water and soil, and thus pose contrasting constrains to microbial assemblies.

AB Climate change poses a considerable threat to the biodiversity of high altitude ecosystems worldwide, including cold-water river systems that are responding rapidly to a shrinking cryosphere. Most recent research has demonstrated the severe vulnerability of river invertebrates to glacier retreat but effects upon other aquatic groups remain poorly quantified. Using new data sets from the European Alps, we show significant responses to declining glacier cover for diatoms, which play a critical functional role as freshwater primary producers. Specifically, diatom alpha-diversity and density in rivers presently fed by glaciers will increase with future deglaciation, yet beta-diversity within and between sites will reduce because declining glacier influence will lower the spatiotemporal variability of glacier cover and its associated habitat heterogeneity. Changes in diatom assemblage composition as glacier cover declined were associated strongly with increasing riverbed stability and water temperature. At the species level, diatoms showed a gradation of responses; for example, Eunotia trinacria, found exclusively at river sites with high (>= 52%) catchment glacier cover, may be affected negatively by ice loss. Conversely, seven taxa confined to sites with no glacier cover, including Gomphonema calcareum, stand to benefit. Nineteen (22%) taxa were noted as threatened, endangered, rare or decreasing on the Red List of Algae for Germany, with most at sites <= 26% glacier cover, meaning further ice loss may benefit these diatoms. However, six taxa found only in rivers >= 28% glacier cover may require reclassification of their Red List conservation status, as this habitat is threatened by deglaciation. Our identification of clear links between decreasing glacier cover and river diatom biodiversity suggests there could be significant reorganization of river ecosystems with deglaciation, for example, through alterations to primary production, biogeochemical cycles, and the shifting resource base of alpine freshwater food webs which lack significant allochthonous energy inputs.

AB Macrofaunal activities in sediments modify nutrient fluxes in different ways including the expression of species-specific functional traits and density-dependent population processes. The invasive polychaete genus Marenzelleria was first observed in the Baltic Sea in the 1980s. It has caused changes in benthic processes and affected the functioning of ecosystem services such as nutrient regulation. The large-scale effects of these changes are not known. We estimated the current Marenzelleria spp. wet weight biomass in the Baltic Sea to be 60-87kton (95% confidence interval). We assessed the potential impact of Marenzelleria spp. on phosphorus cycling using a spatially explicit model, comparing estimates of expected sediment to water phosphorus fluxes from a biophysical model to ecologically relevant experimental measurements of benthic phosphorus flux. The estimated yearly net increases (95% CI) in phosphorous flux due to Marenzelleria spp. were 4.2-6.1kton based on the biophysical model and 6.3-9.1kton based on experimental data. The current biomass densities of Marenzelleria spp. in the Baltic Sea enhance the phosphorus fluxes from sediment to water on a sea basin scale. Although high densities of Marenzelleria spp. can increase phosphorus retention locally, such biomass densities are uncommon. Thus, the major effect of Marenzelleria seems to be a large-scale net decrease in the self-cleaning capacity of the Baltic Sea that counteracts human efforts to mitigate eutrophication in the region.

AB Niche characteristics and traits affect species distributions. However, their effects on the distribution of microorganisms remain understudied, especially in subarctic regions. Our aim was to determine the effects of species niche characteristics and traits on benthic diatom (Bacillariophyceae) elevational distributions, and to identify the key drivers of trait diversity across climate-sensitive subarctic ponds. We sampled 102 ponds along an elevational gradient of 10 to 1,038 m a.s.l. in subarctic Finland and Norway. We calculated the niche characteristics by Outlying Mean Index analysis using an independent data set collected from 141 lakes in northern Fennoscandia. We ran generalised linear models to identify traits most strongly affecting the distribution of individual species, and used a functional dispersion metric to explore trait diversity at community level. Benthic diatom distributions correlated positively with niche breadth, implying that generalists were more widely distributed than specialists, but negatively with niche position, suggesting that marginal species had narrow distributions. Cell size and acid tolerance were the key traits affecting diatom distributions: small size and strong acid tolerance were associated with a wider distribution. Local abiotic variables were more important than elevation in shaping trait diversity, which increased with pH and decreased with conductivity. Several acidic wetland ponds located at low elevations exhibited functionally clustered communities, reflecting stressful conditions that comprised a filter that selected acid-tolerant species. Our results suggest that benthic diatom distributions across subarctic ponds are jointly driven by species cell size and tolerance towards water chemistry variables, especially acidity. Although elevation summarises the effects of several environmental factors, local abiotic variables were more strongly associated with trait diversity than were elevation effects. Our findings provide new insights into the key mechanisms associated with aquatic microbial distributions in highly sensitive climatic regions.

AB Large scale dams have numerous significant impacts on river and nearshore components of watersheds. Large scale dam removal is therefore an increasingly useful restoration tool that reestablishes physical processes and habitats that form nearshore ecosystems. Removing large scale dams will likely affect the functional ecology of nearshore ecosystems, but this concept has yet to be explored. Here we use data from a decade long study to define how the functional ecology of fish responded to large scale dam removal. Dam removal resulted in shifts in the nearshore through the reconnection of riverine and marine hydrodynamic system, large-scale and rapid creation of nearshore habitats, and a shift in nearshore habitats from tidally influenced to non-tidally influenced habitats. The functional diversity of the fish community within the system restored by dam removal was volatile during and after dam removal. Dam removal released sediment that formed new lower river and estuary. These new nearshore habitats supported a fish community of significantly greater functional dispersion and entropy relative to previously present beaches within and outside the new delta. That is, species unique in their diet, habitat use, morphology, and size were abundant relative to less functionally unique fish in newly formed beaches. These trends were temporary as there were no significant differences in functional diversity or entropy of fishes among sites after the restoration. Newly formed habitats proved to be more diverse but had lower resiliency after dam removal. Newly establishing nearshore sites appear more vulnerable to non-native and nuisance species that could disrupt the establishment of the watershed and shoreline. While functional richness at the original estuary sites dropped dramatically after dam removal, resiliency was higher after dam removal corresponding to a shift from estuary to lower river side channel habitat, indicating a more stable nearshore zone than new sites. We anticipate that functional diversity at the newly formed nearshore areas will stabilize as the habitats are vegetated and mature.

AB Thalattosuchians are a group of Mesozoic crocodylomorphs known from aquatic deposits of the Early Jurassic-Early Cretaceous that comprises two main lineages of almost exclusively marine forms, Teleosauridae and Metriorhynchoidea. Teleosaurids were found in shallow marine, brackish and freshwater deposits, and have been characterized as semiaquatic near-shore forms, whereas metriorhynchids are a lineage of fully pelagic forms, supported by a large set of morphological characters of the skull and postcranial anatomy. Recent contributions on Thalattosuchia have been focused on the study of the endocranial anatomy. This newly available information provides novel evidence to suggest adaptations on the neuroanatomy, senses organs, vasculature, and behavioral evolution of these crocodylomorphs. However, is still not clear if the major morphological differences between teleosaurids and metriorhynchids were also mirrored by changes in the braincase and endocranial anatomy. Based on X-ray CT scanning and digital endocast reconstructions we describe the braincase and endocranial anatomy of two well-preserved specimens of Thalattosuchia, the semiaquatic teleosaurid Steneosaurus bollensis and the pelagic metriorhynchid Cricosaurus araucanensis. We propose that some morphological traits, such as: an enlarged foramen for the internal carotid artery, a carotid foramen ventral to the occipital condyle, a single CN XII foramen, absence of brain flexures, well-developed cephalic vascular system, lack of subtympanic foramina and the reduction of the paratympanic sinus system, are distinctive features of Thalattosuchia. It has been previously suggested that the enlarged foramen for the internal carotid artery, the absence of brain flexures, and the hypertrophied cephalic vascular system were synapomorphies of Metriorhynchidae; however, new information revealed that all of these features were already established at the base of Thalattosuchia and might have been exapted later on their evolutionary history. Also, we recognized some differences within Thalattosuchia that previously have not been received attention or even were overlooked (e.g., circular/bilobate trigeminal foramen, single/double CN XII foramen, separation of the cranioquadrate canal from the external otic aperture, absence/presence of lateral pharyngeal foramen). The functional significances of these traits are still unclear. Extending the sampling to other Thalattosuchia will help to test the timing of acquisition and distribution of these morphological modifications among the whole lineage. Also comparison with extant marine tetrapods (including physiological information) will be crucial to understand if some (and/or which) of the morphological peculiarities of thalattosuchian braincases are products of directional natural selection resulting in a fully adaptation to a nektonic life style.

AB In this study, the concept of functional feeding groups was used to classify and model the seasonal variation of zooplankton functional groups in relation to environmental variables. A total of 48 zooplankton species were observed in the reservoir and grouped into 8 functional groups. Both environmental variable and the biomass of zooplankton functional groups vary spatially and seasonally. Water temperature, water transparency, total nitrogen and nitrates were significantly higher in summer, while chlorophyll-a and ammonium were higher in autumn and spring, respectively. Biomass of zooplankton was significantly higher in summer (245.81 mu g/L), followed by autumn (196.54 mu g/L) and spring (54.25 mu g/L). Group RF (rotifer filter feeders) dominated in spring, accounting for 80% of the total biomass. In summer and autumn, group RC (rotifer carnivore) and SCF (small copepods and cladocerans filter feeders) were the dominant, respectively. Total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonium, chlorophyll-a and water transparency were the major factor influencing zooplankton community. Group RF was positively influenced by ammonium and total phosphorus, while RC, SCF and MCF (middle copepods and cladocerans filter feeders) were positively correlated with chlorophyll-a. Top-down control of phytoplankton by groups RC, SCF and MCF in Xiquanyan reservoir is not strong enough to produce negative effect. Increase in predator size biomass did not strengthen top-down control on prey. It is quite clear that the zooplankton function groups of Xiquanyan reservoir followed a predictable seasonal pattern. This therefore highlights the significance of environmental variables in structuring plankton composition in the reservoir.

AB Sustainably managing natural resources under climate change requires understanding how species distribution shifts can impact ecosystem structure and functioning. While numerous studies have documented changes in species' distributions and abundances in response to warming [1, 2], the consequences for the functional structure of ecosystems (i.e., composition of species' functional traits) have received less attention. Here, using thirty years of fish monitoring, we show that two connected North Atlantic ecosystems (E. English Channel and S. North Sea) underwent a rapid shift in functional structure triggered by a climate oscillation to a prevailing warm-phase in the late-1990s. Using time-lag-based causality analyses, we found that rapid warming drove pelagic fishes with r-selected life history traits (e.g., low age and size at maturity, small offspring, low trophic level) to shift abruptly northward from one ecosystem to the other, causing an inversion in functional structure between the two connected ecosystems. While we observed only a one-year time-lag between the climate oscillation and the functional shift, indicating rapid responses to a changing environment, historical overfishing likely rendered these ecosystems susceptible to climatic stress [3], and declining fishing in the North Sea may have exacerbated the shift. This shift likely had major consequences for ecosystem functioning due to potential changes in biomass turnover, nutrient cycling, and benthic-pelagic coupling [4-6 ]. Under ongoing warming, climate oscillations and extreme warming events may increase in frequency and severity [7, 8 ], which could trigger functional shifts with profound consequences for ecosystem functioning and services.

AB This study evaluated the biological effects of highly polluted freshwater environment (Regi Lagni channels, S Italy) on the aquatic moss Leptodictyinn riparium, exposed in bags at three sites representative of different environmental conditions and characterized by different heavy metal burdens. Bioaccumulation, ultrastructural alterations, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production, antioxidant enzymes activity and DNA damage were assessed. To better evaluate the biological response of the moss species to heavy metals, the same biological parameters were assessed also in L. riparium samples cultured in vitro using metal mixtures at the same concentrations as measured at the 3 field exposure sites. Heavy metals were accumulated into the moss tissues causing severe ultra-structural damages at higher concentration case studies, and the ROS production as well as the activity of the enzyme followed a concentration-dependent increase. However, the DNA damage trend suggested a threshold effect that changed between field and in vitro experiment. The enrichment factor suggests that the concentration in the most polluted site is close to the upper limit of L. riparium to accumulate metals. Overall, combining measures of the morpho-functional traits at different level contribute to improving the knowledge about the tolerance of L. riparium to heavy metal stress, suggesting that this moss could be suitable for biomonitoring activity in field conditions.

AB Increasing environmental pressures and human impacts are reshaping community structures and species interactions throughout all trophic levels. The morphological and behavioural characteristics of species communities contain key ecological information on why prey species appear attractive to predators but are rarely applied when exploring predator-prey (PP) relationships. Expanding our knowledge on how changing prey communities can alter the food resource suitability (RS) for predators is vital for understanding PP dynamics in changing ecosystems. Detailed predator diet data are commonly restricted to commercially important species and often not available over long temporal scales. To find out whether structural changes of prey communities impact the food RS for predator communities over space and time, we apply a novel framework to describe and interpret changes in predator diet-suitability based on predation-relevant traits of prey. We use information on described feeding links from the literature to compile the prey spectrum for each predator and subsequently translate the prey-species into a prey-trait spectrum. For each predator, we then calculate a frequency-based prey-trait affinity score and relate it to the available food resource pool, the community weighted means of prey traits, resulting in a prey-suitability measure. We aim to reveal whether a described multi-decadal change in the community structure of zoobenthos had an impact on the food suitability for the benthic-feeding fish in a coastal system of the Baltic Sea. We assess the direction of change in resource quality from the perspective of benthic-feeding fish and describe predator-specific responses to examine which species are likely to profit or be disadvantaged by changes in their prey spectrum. Furthermore, we test the relationship between functional diversity of prey communities and food suitability for predators, and whether predation linkage-structures are affected through prey community-changes. Our results show that changes in zoobenthic communities had a positive effect on the food suitability for most benthic-feeding fish, implying more suitable food resources. Species-specific responses of predators suggest varying plasticity to cope with prey assemblages of different trait compositions. Additionally, the functional diversity of zoobenthos had a positive effect on the food suitability for predator fish. The changing trait compositions of prey influenced the PP linkage-structure, indicating varying specialisation of benthic feeding fish towards available food resources. Our findings suggest that changing morphological characteristics of prey can impact food RS features for its predators. This approach enables long-term evaluation of prey quality characteristics where no detailed diet data is available and allows for cross-system comparison as it is not relying on taxonomic identities per se.

AB Background: Survival in temporally or spatially changing environments is a prerequisite for the perpetuation of a given species. In addition to genetic variation, the role of epigenetic processes is crucial in the persistence of organisms. For instance, mechanisms such as developmental flexibility enable the adjustment of the phenotype of a given individual to changing conditions throughout its development. However, the extent of factors other than genetic variability, like epigenetic processes, in the production of alternative phenotype and the consequences in realized ecological niches is still unclear.
   Methods: In this study, we compared the extent of realized niches between asexual and sexual individuals from different environments. We used a trait-based ecology approach exploiting trophic and locomotive structures to infer the environment that each biotype actually used. More specifically, we compared the morphology of the all-female clonal and sperm-dependent fish Chrosomus eos-neogaeus to that of their sexual host species C. eos in common garden and natural conditions.
   Results: Transfer from natural to controlled conditions resulted in a similar shift in measured morphology for clonal and sexual individuals suggesting comparable level of flexibility in both kinds of organisms. However, clonal, but not sexual, individuals displayed a consistent phenotype when reared in uniform conditions indicating that in absence of genetic variation, one phenotype corresponds to one niche. This contrasted with results from natural conditions where clones were morphologically as variable as sexual individuals within a sampled site. In addition, similar phenotypic changes for both clonal and sexual individuals were observed among the majority of sampled sites, indicating that they responded similarly to the same environments.
   Discussion: Our results indicated that clones can efficiently use different niches and may evolve in a range of environmental conditions comparable to that of a sexual species, thus underlying the importance of factors other than genetic variability, like epigenetic processes, for coping with environmental heterogeneity.

AB Questions Ungulates affect plant community structure and composition. Vegetation response to these effects are variable. Wild large herbivore populations are declining globally, but how tree communities respond to this change is not clear. We experimentally examined how tree communities respond to changes in ungulate abundance in a heterogeneous landscape. Location Lake Mburo National Park, Uganda. Methods We recorded tree species in nine replicate sites each with four treatment plots: fenced off-mound (excluding ungulates), unfenced off-mound, fenced and unfenced on-mound. Each species was assessed for fruit type, leafing strategy, spinescence and bark thickness. We compared tree communities on- and off-mound, with and without ungulates using PERMANOVA, and the effects of habitat, fencing and time on stem density and traits using generalized linear mixed effects model. Results Stem density increased by 88% off-mound and 138% on-mound (p = 0.005) with fencing, between 2006 and 2015. Whether tree communities occurred on- or off-mound determined species composition, but fencing had little effect. Tree traits were not markedly altered by fencing on-mound. Off-mound, fencing was associated with a 38% increase in the proportion of fleshy-fruited tree stems (p < 0.001), 18% decline in armed tree stems (p = 0.035) and a 44% reduction in mean bark thickness (p = 0.001). Conclusion Our study highlights the important role mounds play in maintaining tree community composition with declining ungulate abundance. While ungulates influence tree communities off-mounds they have little effect on tree composition and traits of mound-borne trees. Thus, Macrotermes mounds support distinct tree communities that are robust to exclusion of ungulates.

AB Biotic-environment interactions have long been considered an important factor in functional phenotype differentiation in organisms. The differentiation processes determining functional phenotypes can reveal important mechanisms yielding differences in specific functions of animal traits in the ecosystem. In the present study, we examined functional morphological variations in relation to increasing geographic altitude. Six fish species were examined for how environment factors affect intra-specific functional morphology in the subtropical Pearl River in southern China. Functional morphology traits revealed variable effects due to geographic elevation, although spatial autocorrelation existed among the species tested. The results showed that high-elevation individuals had a more narrow-bodied morphology, with more flexible maneuvrability when swimming, and more evenly distributed musculature than low-elevation individuals. Low-elevation individuals preyed upon larger food sources than high-elevation individuals in some species. Fish functional morphology was strongly affected by regional environmental factors (such as elevation and water temperature) and physical characteristics of local rivers (such as flow velocity, river fractals, and coefficients of fluvial facies). In addition, the effects of the regional factors were stronger than those of the local factors in the Pearl River. Furthermore, it was found that morphological traits associated with locomotion were primarily effected by the river's physical characteristics. While morphological traits associated with food acquisition were primarily affected by water chemical factors (such as DO, water clarity, NH4-N concentration, and TDS). These results demonstrated that habitat has an influence on the biological morphology of fish species, which further affects the functioning of the organism within the ecosystem.

AB Intraspecific variability, although comparably less studied than interspecific variation, is an important tool in understanding population responses to environmental gradients. This study investigated intraspecific trait variation across three contrasting aquatic flow habitat types (intermittent creek, billabong and river) in a common mouth-brooding freshwater fish in northern Australia, the mouth almighty Glossamia aprion. Samples of G. aprion were collected at various sites, within the Daly River catchment. It was predicted that a number of morphological and reproductive traits would vary among individuals across the contrasting habitats. Five out of the nine morphological and reproductive traits studied significantly varied across flow habitat types. Significant intraspecific variation in functional traits related to foraging and reproduction, such as relative eye size, eye vertical position and relative maxillary length in males suggest that the inherent characteristics of each flow habitat type could be exerting selective pressure on the morphology of G. aprion. Interestingly, traits related to swimming performance (body lateral shape) and manoeuvrability (pectoral fin ventral position) differed between flow habitat types but showed inconsistent responses to predictions. Whilst this study was temporally and spatially limited, it highlights that intraspecific variability in morphological traits can occur among flow habitat types over relatively small spatial scales.

AB Understanding biodiversity patterns and their drivers across large spatial scales has become a necessary component of addressing complex multiscale conservation challenges. Increasingly, functional diversity measures are being used to provide insight on the ecological integrity of ecosystems. We estimated functional diversity at two different spatial extents using data sets of contrasting sampling intensity and time duration and compared these two different approaches. For our regional-scale analysis, we used large-scale fish sampling data sets and identified 397 species across subbasins within the southeastern USA. For our state-scale analysis, we used data from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Statewide Stream Assessment through which 101 species were collected from wadeable streams across South Carolina. For all fish species, we scored trophic and reproductive traits and measured trophic and reproductive functional diversity across subbasins and South Carolina streams. We assessed differences in functional diversity between level III ecoregions, quantified the influence of imperiled and invasive species on functional diversity, and modeled relationships between functional diversity and environmental variables at the state scale using Random Forest regression. At both scales, we found support for higher trophic functional diversity in high-elevation ecoregions, while reproductive functional diversity was generally higher in low-elevation ecoregions. The inclusion of imperiled species increased functional diversity estimates, while invasive species decreased functional diversity estimates except for reproductive functional diversity at the regional scale. Environmental variables that correlated with functional diversity at the state scale included forest cover, elevation, and conductivity. The observed spatial patterns of functional diversity, the environmental variables identified as predictors of functional diversity, and knowledge of how imperiled and invasive species influence functional diversity can be used to guide freshwater fish conservation efforts across the southeastern U.S. region. Additionally, these findings highlight the utility of data from intensive, standardized, broad-scale aquatic surveys in addressing these and similar questions regarding freshwater diversity.

AB A major challenge in predicting the response of both social-hydrological and social-ecological systems to environmental change is the lack of a causal framework for predicting thresholds of change between the linked social and natural components. Here we propose a social-ecohydrological thresholds (SEHT) framework that integrates social-hydrological, trait-based ecological, and ecosystem services concepts. This approach facilitates the identification of thresholds by treating ecosystem services as indicators of the coupling of social and natural components of the system. Using the San Pedro riparian corridor in Arizona as a case study, we implemented the SEHT framework using ecological research and stakeholder perspectives to identify key drivers and thresholds in the social-ecohydrological system. In this way, we were able to describe expected outcomes of different hydrological change scenarios on the system. Stakeholders provided input on the utility of this information to inform management decisions aimed at mitigating the impacts of environmental change. The SEHT framework provides insight on dynamics of ecosystem services. This paper demonstrates that application of the framework enables the identification of several critical drivers of potential thresholds in ecosystem services that derive from either natural or social components of the overall system. These potential thresholds can guide ecosystem service assessment and monitoring and provide a roadmap for environmental management and the development of management scenarios.

AB Performing biological assessments of freshwater systems is crucial in most tropical rivers as the lack of in-depth knowledge about functional diversity inhibits the design of appropriate water management and restoration plans. Therefore, in this paper, we investigated the presence and evolution of the functional diversity of the macroinvertebrate community along a tropical river. More specifically, 31 locations were sampled in the Portoviejo River (Ecuador) and identified macroinvertebrates were assigned to one of the following functional feeding groups (FEGs): shredders, collector-gatherers, collector-filterers, scraper-grazers and predators. Results show that high fluctuations and relatively low similarly in functional feeding group composition occurred among closely located sites, suggesting the presence of local disturbances. Locations close to the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant show an extreme dominance of scraper-grazers, suggesting elevated nutrient input and algae growth. Further downstream, the interaction of upstream disturbances and local land use influenced the community composition. These interactions and the confirmation of the importance of land use on aquatic communities underline the fact that management should include both taxonomic and functional diversity.

AB Premise of the Study Methods We present the first plastome phylogeny encompassing all 77 monocot families, estimate branch support, and infer monocot-wide divergence times and rates of species diversification. We conducted maximum likelihood analyses of phylogeny and BAMM studies of diversification rates based on 77 plastid genes across 545 monocots and 22 outgroups. We quantified how branch support and ascertainment vary with gene number, branch length, and branch depth. Key Results Conclusions Phylogenomic analyses shift the placement of 16 families in relation to earlier studies based on four plastid genes, add seven families, date the divergence between monocots and eudicots+Ceratophyllum at 136 Mya, successfully place all mycoheterotrophic taxa examined, and support recognizing Taccaceae and Thismiaceae as separate families and Arecales and Dasypogonales as separate orders. Only 45% of interfamilial divergences occurred after the Cretaceous. Net species diversification underwent four large-scale accelerations in PACMAD-BOP Poaceae, Asparagales sister to Doryanthaceae, Orchidoideae-Epidendroideae, and Araceae sister to Lemnoideae, each associated with specific ecological/morphological shifts. Branch ascertainment and support across monocots increase with gene number and branch length, and decrease with relative branch depth. Analysis of entire plastomes in Zingiberales quantifies the importance of non-coding regions in identifying and supporting short, deep branches. We provide the first resolved, well-supported monocot phylogeny and timeline spanning all families, and quantify the significant contribution of plastome-scale data to resolving short, deep branches. We outline a new functional model for the evolution of monocots and their diagnostic morphological traits from submersed aquatic ancestors, supported by convergent evolution of many of these traits in aquatic Hydatellaceae (Nymphaeales).

AB Biofilms, the complex communities of microbiota that live in association with aquatic interfaces, are considered to be hotspots of microbial life in many aquatic ecosystems. Although the importance of attached algae and bacteria is widely recognized, the role of the highly abundant biofilm-dwelling micrograzers (i.e., heterotrophic protists and small metazoans) is poorly understood. Studies often highlight the resistance of bacterial biofilms to grazing within the microbial food web and therefore argue that the micrograzers have a modulating role (i.e., have effects on biofilm phenotype) rather than a direct trophic role within biofilms. In the present review, we show that this view comes too short, and we establish a conceptual framework of biofilm food webs consisting of three major elements. (1) Energy pathways and subsidization from plankton. As inhabitants of interfaces, biofilm-dwelling grazers potentially access both planktonic organisms and surface-associated organisms. They can play an important role in importing planktonic production into the biofilm food web and thus in the coupling of the planktonic and benthic food webs. Nevertheless, specialized grazers are also able to utilize significant amounts of autochthonous biofilm production. (2) Horizontal complexity of the basal food web. While bacteria and algae within biofilms are edible in general, food quality and accessibility of both bacteria and algae can differ considerably between different prey phenotypes occurring during biofilm formation with respect to morphology, chemical defense, and nutrient stoichiometry. Instead of considering bacteria and algae within biofilms to be generally resistant to feeding by micrograzers, we suggest considering a horizontal food-quality axis to be at the base of biofilm food webs. This food quality gradient is probably associated with increasing costs for the micrograzers. (3) Vertical food web complexity and food chain length. In addition to the consumption of bacteria and algae, many predatory micrograzers exist within biofilm food webs. With the help of video microscopy, we were able to demonstrate the existence of a complex food web with several trophic levels within biofilms. Our conceptual framework should assist in integrating food web concepts and processes into whole-biofilm budgets and in understanding food-web-related interactions within biofilms.

AB Despite a wealth of methods currently proposed by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) to assess macro-benthic integrity, determining good ecological status (GES) and assessing ecosystem recovery following anthropogenic degradation is still one of the biggest challenges in marine ecology research. In this study, our aim was to test a number of commonly used structural (e.g. Shannon-Wiener, Average Taxonomic Diversity (Delta), M-AMBI) and functional indicators (e.g. BTA, BPc) currently used in benthic research and monitoring programmes on the Eden estuary (Scotland). Historically the estuary has a legacy of high nutrient conditions and was designated as a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in 2003, whence major management measures were implemented in order to ameliorate the risk of eutrophication symptoms. We therefore collected data on intertidal macro-benthic communities over a sixteen year interval, covering a pre-management (1999) and post-management (2015) period to assess the effectiveness of the intended restoration efforts. In the post-management period, the results suggested an improvement in the structure and functioning of the estuary as a whole, but macro-benthic assemblages responded to restoration variably along the estuarine gradient. The greatest improvements were noticed in the upper and central sites of the estuary with functional traits analysis suggesting an increased ability of these sites to provide ecosystem services associated with the benthic environment such as carbon and organic matter cycling. Generally, almost all of the structural and functional indicators detected the prevailing environmental conditions (with the exception of (Pielou's index and Average Taxonomic Diversity (.)), highlighting the appropriateness of such methods to be used in monitoring the recovery of transitional systems. This research also provides a robust baseline to monitor further management actions in the Eden estuary and provides evidence that notable reductions in nitrate concentrations resulting from NVZ designations may result in significant improvements to benthic structure and functioning.

AB Fish predation and habitat structure provided by aquatic plants influence wetland macroinvertebrates. However, the patterns of macroinvertebrate distribution (including their functional structure) in relation to fish occurrence and plant habitats comprised by differently shaped macrophytes remain challenging to predict in many wetland systems, and are especially little studied in the Neotropics. We assessed the effects of fish presence and aquatic plant habitat types with different levels of structural complexity (Sphagnum bogs: 'high complexity', Peruvian watergrass: 'low complexity') on the taxonomic and functional structures of macroinvertebrate assemblages in the southern Brazilian highland wetlands. We tested the expectations that macroinvertebrate assemblages have: (1) a lower richness and abundance, and are comprised by taxa with traits related to less prey vulnerability in the presence of fishes; (2) a higher richness and abundance in plant habitats with higher complexity, and distinct taxonomic and functional compositions among habitats. Six wetlands of similar hydroperiods presenting both habitat types and differing according to fish presence (three wetlands contained predatory fish species; the other three were fishless) were seasonally sampled in 2012 and 2013. Macroinvertebrate assemblages changed only according to the fish presence. Richness and abundance were higher in fishless wetlands, and the effect of fish presence on macroinvertebrate taxonomic and trait compositions was also related to each wetland, suggesting varying effects of fish species. Our results suggest that macroinvertebrate assemblages are primarily structured by fish presence rather than plant habitat types in highland wetlands in southern Brazil, and that the influence of plant habitats possibly co-varies with other local environmental factors.

AB The spatiotemporal shifts of the bacterioplankton community can mirror their transition of functional traits in an aquatic ecosystem. However, the spatiotemporal variation of the bacterioplankton community composition structure (BCCS) within a large, shallow, highly dynamic freshwater lake is still poorly understood. Here, we examined the seasonal and spatial variability of the BCCs within Poyang Lake by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene amplicon to explore how hydrological changes affect the BCCs. Principal coordinate analysis showed that the BCCs varied significantly among four sampling seasons, but not spatially. The seasonal changes of the BCCs were mainly attributed to the differences between autumn and spring-winter. Higher alpha diversity indices were observed in autumn. Redundancy analysis indicated that the BCCs co-variated with water level, pH, temperature, total phosphorus, ammoniacal nitrogen, electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, and turbidity. Among them, water level was the key determinant separating autumn BCCs from the BCCs in other seasons. A significantly lower relative abundance of Burkholderiales (betI and betVII) and a higher relative abundance of Actinomycetales (acI, acTH1, and acTH2) were found in autumn than in other seasons. Overall, our results suggest that water level changes associated with pH, temperature, and nutrient status shaped the seasonal patterns of the BCCs within Poyang Lake.

AB Aim: Functional redundancy occurs when species share overlapping ecological functions and is considered an important component of ecosystem resilience. However, much of what we know about functional redundancy comes from relatively species-rich terrestrial and marine environments. Here, we examined patterns of functional redundancy among Ontario freshwater fish communities with species richness levels ranging from 4 to 30 species across lakes of differing size, depth, productivities and thermal characteristics.
   Location: Six thousand nine hundred and seventy-seven lakes in Ontario, Canada.
   Methods: We examined functional redundancy by quantifying the relationship between functional diversity and species richness in lakes across Ontario and within smaller biogeographic regions. We used null models to test whether fish communities had greater redundancy than expected from random assemblages. We then used generalized additive models (GAMs) to predict how patterns of redundancy vary across environmental variables. At last, we compared species-level functional rarity metrics across fish thermal preference groups, body sizes and species occurrence rates.
   Results: The functional diversity and species richness relationship were saturating among fish communities at the provincial scale but varied between smaller regions with differing biogeographic histories. Most communities fell within expectations from weighted null models of the functional diversity and species richness relationship. The GAMs indicated that fish communities in the largest, deepest and warmest lakes showed the greatest overall functional redundancy. No differences were observed in functional rarity measures between thermal preference groups, across body sizes or across species occurrence rates.
   Main conclusions: Although lakes in this study were relatively depauperate of fish species, Ontario fish communities exhibited functional redundancy at the provincial scale, with variation regionally. North-eastern communities showed the least saturating relationship overall as predicted by historical biogeographic patterns of freshwater fish colonization. Overall, this study provides a broad perspective of freshwater fish diversity patterns and highlights the importance of investigating redundancy from different perspectives and multiple spatial scales.

AB The lotic habitats affected by trout farm waste are colonized with a particular invertebrate community of which chironomids are the most abundant group. However, there is little information available regarding how chironomid community structures respond to this type of pollution at the highest taxonomic resolution. Eight fish farms, together with their lotic systems as recipients, were used to test the variability of the chironomid community and its surrogates (taxonomic and functional metrics) across spatially arranged sampling sites to form a gradual decrease in the trout farm influence. The self organizing map (SOM) classified six different types of chironomid communities which were characteristic for both the control and affected habitats. The species indicator analyses listed 32 taxa as positive indicators of water pollution. The SOM and Kruskal-Wallis test revealed that the pattern of chironomid community structure obtained was mainly driven by six environmental parameters (Altitude, conductivity, distance from the outlet, hardness, HN4-N, NO3-N). Categorical principal components analysis (CATPCA) derived three models for each type of biotic metric, in which for diversity-, taxonomy- and functional feeding group-based metrics, the first two dimensions explained 55.2%, 58.3% and 55.4%, of the total variance respectively for 315 sampling sites. According to this analysis, the total number of taxa (S), abundance and the Shannon-Wiener index (H') (as a diversity metric), as well as the proportion of Tanypodinae (as taxonomic group) and grazers/scraper (GRA) and gatherer collector (GAT)(as FFG metrics), were related to the outlet distance gradient, thus showing great potential to be used in the multimetric approach in bioassessment.

AB Tools that provide decision makers with an understanding of ecosystem response to changes in streamflow attributes are necessary to balance human and ecosystem water needs. Flow response curves provide one such approach for informing management based on modeled relationships between environmental control (e.g., flood magnitude) and response (e.g., plant recruitment) variables, although unidirectional relationships may fail to capture the complex interactions between ecological and physical processes in riparian ecosystems. We take advantage of the linkage between plant functional traits important for (a) determining a plant's response to environmental conditions and (b) for predicting its impact on the flow of water and transport of sediment, to build a predictive model of riparian ecosystem dynamics. By using plant functional groups (i.e., guilds), our model accounts for process linkages among streamflow properties, physical processes, and plant community response. The model relies on a series of flow response curves built and tested with data collected along semiarid, canyon-bound rivers in Colorado. We built 2D hydrodynamic models and updated them with a flexible vegetation module to represent plant-hydraulic interactions for three study reaches. Plant guild distributions are well described by the model while predictions of the occurrence and direction of topographic change are less deterministic. Our work is among the first to develop response curves for both physical and ecological processes in the same framework. The shape of the resulting curves indicate that the functioning of riparian ecosystems is driven by nonlinear relationships and that clear, identifiable thresholds exist. As such, changes to the flow regime will have a differential impact on physical and ecological processes, depending on the nature of the shift. We discuss the strength and limitations of our model and make suggestions about its applicability to river management.

AB Plants that live in aquatic habitats are frequently subjected to oxygen limitation and many of them modify their anatomy and physiology to counteract hypoxia. In these habitats, the role of plant associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which are widespread in terrestrial environments and frequently confer benefits to the associated plant, is still debated. Starting from data taken from 34 selected papers, this study focuses on the occurrence of AMF in the roots of wetland and aquatic plants, taking into account the hydrological conditions of the sites, the plant wetland indicators and life forms, plant taxonomy and colonization by dark septate endophytes. The results have demonstrated the importance of hydrology in controlling the frequency and intensity of AMF root colonization, which tends to be low in obligate wetland plants. Moreover, colonization is generally lower and, possibly, less functional in monocots than in dicots. We suggest that the hydrological conditions, by filtering species according to their water tolerance, shape plant community composition, and that although AMF colonization is one of the traits that may increase plant fitness, it is not the most important one. In fact, a range of nutritional and growth strategies, which are more variegated than in terrestrial habitats, exists in wetland/aquatic habitats, and these strategies may rely, or not, on AMF colonization, as a consequence of the habitat and species.

AB With rising sea levels, mortality of glycophytes can be caused by water and nutrient stress under increasing salinity. However, the relative effects of these two stressors may vary by species-specific functional traits. For example, deciduous species, with leaves typically emerging during low salinity periods of the year, may suffer less from water stress than evergreen species. We sampled two woody species with contrasting functional traits: the evergreen and N-2-fixing waxmyrtle (Morella cerifera), and the deciduous and non-N-2 fixing baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) along a coastal river (South Carolina, USA) showing an increasing pattern of plant mortality along a salinity gradient. We first analyzed oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of plant stem water and river water to determine changes in plant source water at different sites. Then we analyzed foliar carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) along with nitrogen and phosphorus content (%N and %P) as proxies for the water and nutrient stress. Results showed that: (1) the two species had different water sources at the higher salinity sites; (2) foliar delta N-15 values of baldcypress decreased with higher salinity while retaining a constant delta C-13 value, and both of these isotope values were positively related with foliar %P, suggesting greater nutrient stress but minor water stress under high salinity; and (3) foliar delta C-13 values of waxmyrtle increased with higher salinity while retaining a constant foliar delta N-15 value, and neither of the values was significantly related to foliar nutrients, suggesting greater water stress but minor nutrient stress under high salinity. The different responses of the two species to high salinity may be related to their differences in leaf phenology and N-2-fixation. Our results suggest that nutrient stress, particularly of P, can contribute to stress and eventual high mortality of baldcypress exposed to salt water intrusion.

AB We developed a pilot study on the potential of aquatic plants as indicators of ecological quality in tropical rivers to provide an index of biotic integrity for monitoring, conservation, and restoration purposes. We used floristic, environmental, and anthropogenic disturbance data from a 950 km(2) river basin in the southern littoral area of Sao Paulo State, Brazil (Itanhaem River Basin), and proposed a five-step methodological framework for the development of a macrophyte index in tropical river basins. Field surveys were carried out in 137 sites (Spring 2013-2014) of Itanhaem River for the index development and in 27 sites of Itapanhad River (Spring 2015) for its validation. A total of 44 aquatic plant species were recorded in the study area, and 11 metrics were evaluated as potential core metrics of the index. Principal Component Analysis distinguished two river types mostly related to geomorphological characteristics - the Upper river type in the mountainous region (average slope 23.7 degrees) and the Middle-low river type (average slope 9.2 degrees) in the floodplain. The Upper river catchment was characterized by extensive areas occupied by banana plantations, low water conductivity, sandy substrates, and homogeneous aquatic vegetation, whereas the Middle-low river catchment had more urban settlements and displayed high nitrogen and phosphorus contents in water and sediments. The index (MIBI-ITA) is preliminary and was based on species richness and life forms (e.g. submerged hydrophytes, helophytes). MIBI-ITA could only be developed for the lowlands and displayed a high discriminatory ability for distinguishing disturbance and a good performance with external data. Bioassessment in tropical rivers require further investigation on biogeography and long-term responses of macrophyte populations to stressors, as well as knowledge-base on river typology and functional traits of macrophytes, other than morpho-anatomic traits and diversity measures.

AB Community assembly depends on dispersal, environmental parameters and species interactions. Here, we compared rotifer communities from two environmentally distinct, but connected basins of Lake Tovel for 5 years, with biweekly (2002) and monthly (2003-2006) sampling. We applied taxonomic and functional diversity-based multivariate analyses (principal components analysis, redundancy analysis) to compare rotifer communities in both basins. For functional diversity, we focused separately on defence and feeding traits that were inferred from rotifer morphology. Taxonomic and functional diversity were generally higher in the deep compared to the shallow basin. In multivariate analyses, water residence time and surface water temperature were important environmental predictors for both taxonomic and functional diversity while the importance of competitors and predators varied according to defence or feeding traits used. The difference between basins showed a gradient from taxonomic (marked difference) to functional diversity, indicating that the processes that regulate feeding traits were similar in both basins while those regulating defence traits were different. The distinction of different aspects of rotifer life (i.e. feeding and predation) outlined different important drivers that would have been neglected by focusing solely on species abundance. Furthermore, we outlined the status quo of trait research in rotifer ecology including its challenges and difficulties.

AB Phytoplankton size has an important functional role in ecosystem processes, such as nutrient production and cycling. It has been suggested that warmer temperatures may favor the smaller organisms in biological communities. We evaluate the mean size of the phytoplankton organisms and apply a morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) approach. We use time series of two floodplain lakes that present mean annual temperature difference of 10A degrees C and similar hydrodynamic, area, and mean depth. We expected that a smaller mean size of MBFGs would be associated with higher temperatures. The Akaike Information Criterion was used to investigate environmental factors predicting the mean size of MBFGs within each lake. The mean size was most associated to nutrients and dissolved oxygen in the subtropical lake, and to temperature in the temperate lake. Large filaments with aerotopes and the small flagellated with siliceous exoskeletal structures showed high mean size at higher temperatures, thus contradicting temperature-size rules. Probably the high variability of mean size was provided by the high variability observed around environmental factors. Our findings reveal that other functional traits may be associated with the phytoplankters mean size, which result in adaptation to high variability of various environmental factors.

AB Single-trait analyses are used to select the most appropriate species characteristics for an effective indication of changes in multiple stressors, but they are robust to detect fine-scale functional changes in biofilms. The combination of single traits may appropriately reflect ecological properties of changing benthic assemblages. We studied colonisation processes of benthic algal assemblages focusing on the changes in trait composition using life forms, type of attachments, cell size and mobility as single traits in a small lowland stream. We tested the descriptive power of single-trait groups (STGs) and also combined trait groups (CTGs). We assumed that STGs would be significantly affected by environmental factors, but compositional changes in biofilms would be described more easily by using CTGs rather than STGs. Our hypotheses were confirmed by the results. While some STGs correlated positively to environmental factors indicating disturbances, others correlated to environmental factors indicating the stable conditions. The fast settlement of large-sized groups was also relevant determining the compositional changes in the studied benthic community. Despite the strong correlation between STGs and environmental variables, CTGs analyses revealed important functional relations in the ecosystem, since CTGs display more sophisticated functional features of the organisms, which may provide more realistic responses.

AB Secondary salinisation has become a hot spot internationally due to its adverse effects on freshwater ecosystems. Although its effects on ecosystem patterns has been broadly studied, its potential effect on ecosystem functions, in particular on the functional traits of freshwater organisms, and functional trait recovery are largely unknown. In this study, we conducted a field investigation at 405 sample sites from May 2009 to July 2016 in surface mining-contaminated streams, in order to evaluate the influence of secondary salinisation on macroinvertebrate functional traits and the recovery potential of dominant functional traits. Results of univariate models showed that sensitive, very tolerant, gill-breathers, cutaneous-breathers, shredders, predators and gatherers were the most responsive indicators to enhanced specific conductivity and sulfate loadings with sensitive, gill-breathers, shredders and predators demonstrating a reduction in abundance, whereas cutaneous-breathers and gatherers exhibiting an increase. Complicated relationships among different species indicated that co-exclusions would not occur because all macroinvertebrate taxa exhibited positive correlations. Results of relative recovery potential showed that omnivores and gatherers recovered quickly following improvements in water quality, whereas gill-breathers, pneumostome-breathers, filterers and scrapers would be expected to recover slowly due to their sensitivity to both specific conductivity and sulfate and low drift propensity. Overall, secondary salinisation has posed severely ecological risks to macroinvertebrate functional attributes in surface mining-contaminated streams, and their effects should be considered in future conservation plans.

AB Environmental fluctuations are ubiquitous and thus essential for the study of adaptation. Despite this, genome evolution in response to environmental fluctuations -and more specifically to the degree of environmental predictability- is still unknown. Saline lakes in the Mediterranean region are remarkably diverse in their ecological conditions, which can lead to divergent local adaptation patterns in the inhabiting aquatic organisms. The facultatively sexual rotifer Brachionus plicatilis shows diverging local adaptation in its life-history traits in relation to estimated environmental predictability in its habitats. Here, we used an integrative approach-combining environmental, phenotypic and genomic data for the same populations-to understand the genomic basis of this diverging adaptation. Firstly, a novel draft genome for B. plicatilis was assembled. Then, genome-wide polymorphisms were studied using genotyping by sequencing on 270 clones from nine populations in eastern Spain. As a result, 4,543 high-quality SNPs were identified and genotyped. More than 90 SNPs were found to be putatively under selection with signatures of diversifying and balancing selection. Over 140 SNPs were correlated with environmental or phenotypic variables revealing signatures of local adaptation, including environmental predictability. Putative functions were associated to most of these SNPs, since they were located within annotated genes. Our results reveal associations between genomic variation and the degree of environmental predictability, providing genomic evidence of adaptation to local conditions in natural rotifer populations.

AB Natural and anthropogenic disturbances alter animal populations in complex ways. Shifts in population size and taxonomic species diversity as such may not always completely reflect the effects of forest disturbance on faunal communities. In this study, we used a functional ecological approach to detect resilient and vulnerable species including anurans (frogs and toads), lizards and snakes, after Hurricane Jova hit the Pacific Coast of Mexico in 2011. Using population abundances, we compared functional traits including habitat preference, body size and reproductive type of the herpetofauna inhabiting tropical dry forest vegetation under a chronosequence of successional stages: active pastures, 0 y; early-forests, 5-6 y; young-forests, 8-10; intermediate-forests 15-17 y; and old-growth continuous forests. A total of 4093 individuals representing 17 species of anurans, 18 lizard species and 25 snake species were recorded. Overall, successional stage and Hurricane Jova affected the number of anurans and lizards in contrasting ways. For example, while the total number of anurans declined significantly after the hurricane in all successional stages (from 736 to 512 individuals), lizard populations significantly increased (from 1084 to 1612), except in old-growth forests. In contrast, neither disturbance type significantly affected the density of snakes (from 81 to 69). Regarding functional traits, there were complex trajectories of change in species abundances according to successional stage after the hurricane. For lizards, abundance within different functional traits was correlated with the chronosequence after Hurricane Jova. Density of terrestrial and medium-sized lizard species increased with successional age, while arboreal and small-sized lizards decreased. For anurans, terrestrial and large-sized species declined elsewhere, while medium- and small-sized species increased in pastures after Hurricane Jova. Furthermore, riparian frogs with aquatic reproduction were recorded only in pastures. The herpetofauna of the tropical dry forest on the Pacific Coast of Mexico is composed of a mixture of species resilient and/or vulnerable to the synergetic impact of human and natural disturbances. Under the present scenario of land-use and land-cover change, therefore, the preservation of old-growth forest tracts in the human-dominated landscape of the study region is extremely important.

AB Assessing ecological health of aquatic ecosystems is crucial in the current context of biodiversity loss to guide and prioritize management actions. Although several fish-based indices were developed to assess the ecological status of estuarine ecosystems, they do not provide guidance on the causal responses of communities to disturbances. The functional trait-based approach provides an understanding of how human disturbance affects the composition of biological and ecological traits in assemblages, as well as their consequences for ecosystem functioning. Here, we evaluate the responses of fish assemblages to human disturbance in 30 French estuaries using several taxonomic and functional indices (e.g. diversity, evenness or redundancy). We tested whether these indices can provide additional information on the human impacts and health of assemblages that are not reflected by the ecological indicator (fish-based index ELFI). Results indicated that high values of local human disturbances were associated to a decrease in fish abundance, decrease in species richness and reduced functional redundancy, whereas taxonomic and functional evenness increased. In contrast, the functional richness remained stable suggesting that the functional traits of species removed by stressors were maintained by more tolerant species. Indeed, we found that the local disturbances mainly resulted in a decrease in the proportions of small benthic species feeding on macro-invertebrates, which were dominant in the studied estuaries. Some functional alterations were detected by the fish-based index, but the decline of functional redundancy was not reflected, highlighting a serious concern for management. Indeed, the abrupt collapse of functional redundancy in response to local disturbances can decrease the ability of assemblages to maintain certain species traits in the face of future environmental disturbance, including climate change. From a management perspective, the application of such functional redundancy measure in monitoring programs can help stakeholders identify sensitive areas where conservation efforts need to be planned.

AB Mudflats-unvegetated, soft-sediment, intertidal habitats-support macrofaunal assemblages that contribute to a number of important ecosystem functions (e.g. food for fish and birds, nutrient and C-cycling). These habitats are widespread but are threatened by increasing pressure from anthropogenic activities. Greater knowledge of the consequences of biodiversity loss for the functioning of ecosystems can aid management, by identifying potential threats. Systematic searches of the Web of Science and SCOPUS identified 163 published datasets of essentially 'pristine' mudflat macrofaunal assemblages, comprising data on 448 taxa from 4 climatic zones and 10 biogeographic regions. Broad-scale patterns of trait distribution confirmed established patterns showing that taxa at low latitudes have smaller body sizes, shorter life spans and more taxa have exoskeletons, and that direct developmental modes are more prevalent at high latitudes. Greater occurrences of burrow dwellers in the temperate zone may support greater rates of sediment turnover, organic matter de composition and nutrient cycling, whereas in the tropics, tube dwellers provide more biogenic habitat. Despite these trait differences, the overall similarity in trait composition relative to taxonomic composition indicated that globally, mudflats are functionally similar. The functional redundancy observed across regional and climatic boundaries suggests that ecosystem functioning and service delivery will show some resilience in the face of perturbation. However, the growing anthropogenic pressures on coastal mudflats means the risk of system collapse, beyond resilience thresholds, is high. This study illustrates how an extensive body of published literature can provide a foundation for developing a global understanding of ecological functioning in mudflats to inform management responses. The prevalence of crustaceans, such as fiddler crabs, in tropical mudflats can provide functional equivalence to the burrowing worms of temperate regions.

AB Partitioning of electron acceptors and macrofaunal bioirrigation were assessed in sediments from 4 stations along a Skagerrak-Kattegat-Belt Sea depth transect. Sediment was examined for benthic fauna composition and abundance, sediment-water fluxes (O-2, dissolved inorganic carbon [DIC], NH4+, and NO3-), anaerobic reactions (carbon oxidation [C-ox], sulfate reduction [SR], manganese reduction [MnR], iron reduction [FeR], and ammonification [N-min]), porewater profiles (O-2, DIC, SO42- and NH4+), and solid phase profiles (organic content, Fe and Mn). Deep stations had less than half the abundance of benthic fauna than shallow stations, while the Belt Sea station was azoic due to bottom-water hypoxia. Solute fluxes and anaerobic reactions showed order-of-magnitude lower rates in sediment from deep than from shallow water. In general, anaerobic C-ox in sediments along the Skagerrak-Kattegat-Belt Sea transect is dominated by SR (>50%) in shallow water and decreases gradually when moving into deeper water and reaches 0 at similar to 700 m depth. FeR increases from 0 in shallow water to similar to 50% at similar to 600 m, but rapidly reaches 0 again at 700 m. MnR is close to 0 down to at least 500 m and increases to complete dominance at 700 m. The contribution of denitrification is generally below 10% at all depths. Bioirrigation-quantified as non-local exchange through diagenetic modelling-is proportional to fauna bio-mass and functional traits. The Br- tracer approach to determine bioirrigation on newly extracted sediment onboard a ship is not recommended. It is concluded that enhanced downward trans location of O-2 into anoxic sediment through bioirrigation is the major mechanism reoxidizing subsurface metals in the deep Skagerrak and Kattegat.

AB The ubiquity of strictly anaerobic sulfur-respiring haloarchaea in hypersaline systems with circumneutral pH has shaken a traditional concept of this group as predominantly aerobic heterotrophs. Here, we demonstrated that this functional group of haloarchaea also has its representatives in hypersaline alkaline lakes. Sediments from various hypersaline soda lakes showed high activity of sulfur reduction only partially inhibited by antibiotics. Eight pure cultures of sulfur-reducing natronoarchaea were isolated from such sediments using formate and butyrate as electron donors and sulfur as an electron acceptor. Unlike strict anaerobic haloarchaea, these novel sulfur-reducing natronoarchaea are facultative anaerobes, whose metabolic capabilities were inferred from cultivation experiments and genomic/proteomic reconstruction. While sharing many physiological traits with strict anaerobic haloarchaea, following metabolic distinctions make these new organisms be successful in both anoxic and aerobic habitats: the recruiting of heme-copper quinol oxidases as terminal electron sink in aerobic respiratory chain and the utilization of formate, hydrogen or short-chain fatty acids as electron donors during anaerobic growth with elemental sulfur. Obtained results significantly advance the emerging concept of halo(natrono)archaea as important players in the anaerobic sulfur and carbon cycling in various salt-saturated habitats.

AB Organisms display sets of functional attributes that reflect local environmental conditions and can be used in environmental quality assessments. We analyzed the functional attributes of Chironomidae in reservoirs in the Brazilian semiarid region with different levels of anthropic disturbances. We examined the relationships of functional feeding groups, feeding strategies, body size, and the morphological adaptations of chironomid larvae with the environmental quality of 94 sites. The sites were classified according to their levels of anthropic disturbance based on environmental characteristics. To observe the relationship between the functional attributes of Chironomidae and the different levels of anthropic disturbance, we performed an RLQ. To test differences between the functional categories of Chironomidae, we use an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The functional categories of Chironomidae that indicated anthropic disturbances were: collector group, reduced pseudopods, abdominal tubule, and gatherers. The least disturbed sites showed higher relative abundances of engulfers, predators, organisms with elongated heads, and small body size. The observed relationships between Chironomid functional attributes and the levels of anthropic impacts on reservoirs in the semiarid region of Brazil allow their use as a tool for assessing the environmental qualities of lentic aquatic ecosystems.

AB This study outlines the development and application of a new multimetric index (Greek Lake Benthic macro invertebrate Index - GLBiI) for the assessment of the ecological quality of Greek lakes, based on the ecological quality ratio (EQR), under the requirements of the Water Framework Directive. Profundal and sublittoral benthic macroinvertebrates from 18 lakes were biannually sampled across Greece. Additionally, 21 environmental parameters and 5 human pressures were assessed for each lake. The hindcasting approach was used for the establishment of reference conditions after minimizing human pressures. A pool of 84 candidate metrics, representing diversity/richness, sensitivity, functional traits, and taxonomical composition, were tested for the development of the multimetric index. Spearman's rank correlation extracted seven environmental parameters (lake area, mean depth, altitude, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen at bottom and conductivity at bottom) and three human pressures (total phosphorus, population density and non-natural land cover) that were further stepwise linear regressed against each biological metric for pressure-response relationships. Finally, three metrics, the number of taxa and the Simpson's diversity index in the profundal and sublittoral zones, and the relative contribution of Chironomidae (%) family in the profundal zone, were selected as the most appropriate, responding to eutrophication (expressed as total phosphorus and non-natural land cover). The multimetric index GLBiI was expressed as the mean of the EQRs of its metrics following a five class ecological status system. This assessment method may be used in other Mediterranean lakes with similar characteristics.

AB Expansion and intensification of human land uses has resulted in the loss of all but remnant areas of natural cover over increasingly vast areas of land. Effective stream assessment in these regions thus requires indicators sensitive to ecosystem change in systems that are already highly stressed. The goal of this study was to determine if benthic macroinvertebrate communities in streams exposed to extensive anthropogenic stress are associated with land-use variables and demonstrate potential to be used as bioindicators for assessment of further land use modification. Using the Grand River in southern Ontario as our model, we sampled for benthic macro invertebrates in 70 small (3-20 km(2)) sub-watersheds that comprised a gradient of intensive land use (65-100% developed). Redundancy analysis and variance partitioning results indicated that macroinvertebrate taxonomy and traits were only weakly associated with environmental gradients with the strongest associations occurring at the reach scale. With strong anthropogenic filters present across the watershed, it is likely that the majority of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the Grand River have experienced a homogenization towards tolerant taxa and traits that respond more to local habitat variables. Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) revealed 19 valid taxa indicators and 32 valid trait indicators for one or more of six environmental variables (percent sub-watershed agriculture, percent buffer agriculture, pool substrate, sediment reduction, natural channel, and riparian width). However, individual taxon and community change points exhibited broad quantile scores indicating a gradual or random response to environmental variables. Comparison of traits and taxonomic associations with environmental variables showed minimal difference suggesting traits may not offer increased sensitivity to land-use stress. However, several traits did show potential to serve as diagnostic indicators for specific stressors associated with agricultural land use. Our ability to identify even a few indicators in a region with intensive human activity is promising for land managers charged with detecting biotic alterations in this stressed system. Further research developing indicators sensitive to intensification of anthropogenic stress in extensively developed landscapes is critical to ensuring managers have the tools needed to protect and enhance aquatic resources.

AB Marine benthic nitrogen (N) cycling may vary widely across space and seasons; it is thus needed to make high-resolution estimations of these important ecosystem processes with a reasonable number of variables. In this study, we determined the benthic denitrification and anammox potentials in two basins, the Bohai Sea and the North Yellow Sea of China in May and November, and evaluated models in predicting these functions with environmental factors and/or microbial gene-based functional traits. We found that denitrification generally dominated the N loss (54-98%), and that the denitrification rate varied greatly between basins and seasons. The anammox rate was generally higher in the Bohai Sea than in the North Yellow Sea in both seasons, and it made a greater contribution in November (22%) than in May (16%). Among the measured environmental factors, chlorophyll a in bottom waters and sedimentary organic carbon content were the most influential for predicting denitrification and anammox rates, respectively. On the other hand, the alpha diversities and gene abundances of involved bacteria were poorly correlated with the function potentials, indicating that these functional traits could not well explain the functions alone. Upon the incorporation of two gene copy number ratios [nosZ/(nirS+nirK) and nirK/bacterial 16S rRNA genes] into the environmental factor-parameterized models, however, we found that the predictive powers of the regression models for total N loss, denitrification and anammox rates, and contributions of anammox increased substantially, indicating that taking microbial functional traits into account could make estimations of these N-cycling functions in coastal ecosystems more accurate.

AB The alteration of form and function through the life of a fish can have profound impacts on the ability to move through water. Although several studies have examined morphology and function in relation to body size, there is a paucity of data for chondrichthyans, an ancient group of fishes. Ratfishes are interesting in that they utilize flapping pectoral fins to drive movement, and they diverged from elasmobranchs early in the gnathostome phylogeny. Using the spotted ratfish, Hydrolagus colliei, we quantified the scaling of traits relevant for locomotion, including median and paired fin external anatomy, the musculature of the pectoral and pelvic fins, and the kinematics of the pectoral fins. Whereas pelvic fins scaled with either positive allometry (fin span and area) or isometry (fin chord length at the base of the fin), pectoral fin measurements either scaled with negative allometry (fin span and aspect ratio) or isometry (fin area and chord length). Correspondingly, all pelvic fin muscles exhibited positive allometry, whereas pectoral muscles exhibited a mix of isometric and positively allometric growth. Caudal fin area and body frontal area both scaled with positive allometry, whereas dorsal fin area and span scale with isometry. Pectoral fin amplitude during swimming exhibited isometry, and fin beat frequency decreased with body size. Our results highlight the complex changes in form and function throughout ontogeny. Finally, we highlight that hierarchical differentiation in morphology can occur during growth, potentially leading to complex changes in performance of a functional system.

AB The Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass (YSCWM) is a seasonal hydrological phenomenon with significant effects on benthic animals. Based on a range of biological traits, including feeding type, tail shape, adult body length, body shape and life history (c-p value), the biological trait analysis (BTA) of marine nematodes in the southern Yellow Sea was studied in June 2003 (summer) and January 2004 (winter) in order to reveal the effects of YSCWM on benthic animals. In terms of biological traits composition of marine nematode assemblages, results of ANOSIM showed that there were no significant differences among sites inside the YSCMW area. However, for spatial distribution, marine nematode assemblages showed significant differences between sites inside and outside of the YSCWM area in terms of body shape, as there was higher percentage of nematodes with slender body shape while lower percentage with stout and long thin body shape at the sites inside the YSCWM area. Results of BIOENV analysis showed that water depth and sediment silt-clay percentage were the most important factors contributed to the differences of biological traits of marine nematode assemblages in summer, while sediment phaeophorbide content best explained the differences of marine nematode assemblages in winter. The existence of the YSCWM may provide a stable environment for marine nematode assemblages, keeping them in a continuous state during the seasonal changes. The higher percentage of nematodes with slender body may be the response to the YSCWM.

AB Bioirrigation: the animal-induced exchange of solutes between pore water and overlying water - is a key process in sediments with profound implications for biogeochemical processes such as nutrient cycling and organic matter regeneration at the sediment water interface. There is an urgent need to understand how a changing environment will affect the irrigation activity of macrofauna and vice versa. A shift in species composition (e.g. from deep burrowing species to smaller, more opportunistic and shallow burrowing species) will have large effects on bioirrigation and thus on ecosystem function (such as benthic pelagic coupling). Considering the difficulties to determine area-covering rates of bioirrigation (e.g. in terms tracer-based fluxes) and the complexity of interactions of multiple species in the community that prohibit a direct measure of bioirrigation attributable to each species, a mechanistically-based approach is needed to predict relative intensities of bioirrigation activity based on the fundamental functional traits. We propose a conceptual framework to develop an index of bioirrigation that takes into account the biological mechanisms of bioirrigation and provides a simplified, yet functionally based approach to quantify the bioirrigation potential of benthic communities.
   We developed the community bioirrigation potential (BIPc) that provides a biomass- and abundance-weighted scoring system considering functional traits related to pore water and solute exchange. It may be used as a supplement to established methods to assess the function of marine soft sediments related bioirrigation. In analogy to the particle-related community bioturbation potential of Solan et al. (2004), context dependent organismal traits that affect ventilation and bioirrigation (feeding type, morphology of burrows, and burrowing depth) are combined with the data on abundance and biomass of the respective species. These are subsequently summed up to a community bioirrigation potential (BIPc).
   This review considers ecological traits relevant for bioirrigation and their classification into a bioirrigation index. Furthermore the necessary simplifications in the index (e.g. limiting its applicability to interfacial nutrient fluxes) are discussed. We also provide a working example from the southwestern Baltic Sea to illustrate the practical application of the index and a compilation of key species related to this area containing their classification into the considered bioirrigation traits.

AB Artificially drained commercial forests are hydrologically novel ecosystems, where the array of aquatic habitats consists of ditches and remnant pools. In general the network of ditches has been found to have longer hydroperiod, the knowledge, however, about aquatic invertebrates in this system is scarce. We examined which environmental factors are impacting the biomass and abundance of functional feeding groups. Scrapers and shredders were aggregated to ditches and gatherers to pools. Filterers' distribution pattern suggested that the function of filtering is carried out by different taxa in pools and ditches. Ditches were rather more suitable for feeding groups that rely on autochthonous resources. Acidity was a major driver of functional community composition, for example, one of the causes for higher scraper frequency in ditches. Predators exhibited greater quantities in extensive macrophyte cover regardless of water body type. Our results suggest that the trophic organization in ditches and pools is different because habitat factors select the feeding groups directly through food resources, but also because of the environmental filter on the other biological traits of the organisms. To support complex ecosystems with several trophic levels also in commercial forests, we suggest to avoid destroying macrophyte rich pools and ditches during silvicultural management.

AB Environmental variations and plant traits can act as a filter in plant communities, selecting better-adapted species. In wetlands, macrophytes display physiological, morphological and life history plasticity that allows them to adapt to flood dynamics reflecting habitat filtering. Our aim was to evaluate if the functional diversity of macrophytic community varies between the flood phases, noting whether water factors influence the functional diversity and whether the traits that denote adaptation are associated with these phases. We evaluated 11 morphological traits of macrophytes. The floristic survey within and on the edge of twenty ponds was carried out on a monthly basis and the water parameters were measured for two years. The functional diversity was lower in the drought' and increased over the flood cycle reaching maximum values in the water recession' phase. Drought' acted as a filter by selecting only a few adapted species and the water recession' acted as a transition area combining favourable conditions for the species of both dry and flood. The trait that contributed most to differentiate the functional groups was the life form. We conclude that the environments under spatial and temporal changes support different communities with different functional characteristics.

AB Questions: How closely do riparian plant communities track hydrological and climatic variation in space, and how do interactions among hydrological and climatic filters influence success of flow management strategies?
   Location: Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA.
   Methods: Multi-year vegetation surveys were conducted across three hydrological zones-active channel, active flood-plain and inactive flood-plain-within each of 42 sandbars that vary geographically in temperature and precipitation along a 400-km river segment. Ecological niche models were used to estimate locally optimal conditions of maximum inundation duration, elevation above daily peak flow, mean annual precipitation and mean maximum and minimum temperature for 16 of the most abundant woody and 58 of the most abundant herbaceous plant species. These estimates were used to calculate CWM environmental preferences, which were used to determine how closely vegetation preferences tracked local variation in environmental factors, and to assess interactive responses of species and communities to variation in hydrology and climate.
   Results: Communities closely tracked hydrological variation across zones, but less so within zones. Communities tracked variation in minimum temperature more closely than maximum temperature or precipitation. At the species level, woody plants that were more abundant in wetter hydrological conditions were also more abundant in wetter climatic conditions, and vice versa. This relationship was even stronger at the community level, where there were significant negative relationships between CWM preferences of inundation duration and temperature for both woody and herbaceous vegetation.
   Conclusions: The climate-hydrology linkages found in this system suggest that increasing temperatures and drought are likely to reduce the inundation tolerance of riparian vegetation within the Grand Canyon. Increasing the duration of high-flow events would likely reduce the abundance of encroaching woody vegetation but could also reduce the resilience of remaining vegetation to heatwaves and drought. The reinforcing effects of climatic and hydrological filters are likely to generally result in greater sensitivity of species composition to environmental change than if those environmental filters acted independently. These results have implications for predicting resource responses to environmental change, as well as prescriptions for direct vegetation management to enhance resilience.

AB Trait-based approaches enable comparison of community composition across multiple organism groups. Yet, little is known about the degree to which empirical trait responses found for one taxonomic group can be generalized across organisms. In this study, we investigated the spatial variability of marine community-weighted mean traits and compared their environmental responses across multiple taxa and habitats, including pelagic zooplankton (copepods), demersal fish, and benthic infaunal invertebrates. We used extensive, spatially explicit datasets collected from scientific surveys in the North Sea and examined community composition of these groups using a trait-based approach. In order to cover the key biological characteristics of an organism, we considered three life-history traits (adult size, offspring size, and fecundity) and taxon-specific feeding traits. While many of the traits co-varied in space and notably demonstrated a south-north gradient, none of the traits showed a consistent spatial distribution across all groups. However, traits are often correlated as a result of trade-offs. When studying spatial patterns of multiple traits variability in fish and copepods, we showed a high spatial correlation. This also applied to a lesser extent to fish and benthic infauna, whereas no correlation was found between benthic infauna and copepods. The result suggested a decoupling in the community traits between strictly benthic and strictly pelagic species. The strongest drivers of spatial variability for many community traits are the gradients in temperature seasonality, primary productivity, fishing effort, and depth. Spatial variability in benthic traits also co-varied with descriptors of the seabed habitat. Overall, results showed that trait responses to environmental gradients cannot be generalized across organism groups, pointing toward potential complex responses of multi-taxa communities to environmental changes and highlighting the need for cross-habitat multi-trait analyses to foresee how environmental change will affect community structure and biodiversity at large.

AB Common life-history aspects among independent lineages often result in the repeated evolution of suites of adaptive traits, or "syndromes'. Such syndromes can be key avenues to understand relationships between morphological and ecological traits, but are rarely tested due to insufficient trait shift repetitions. We use a hyperdiverse lineage to investigate the evolution of a syndrome. Cryptine ichneumonid wasps that parasitize insects concealed in hard substrates display several traits that are putative adaptations to that end. Using a phylogenetic framework from a combined multigene molecular and morphological data set with 308 cryptine species, we tested whether these traits were part of a morphofunctional syndrome related to host use. Ancestral state estimations show multiple origins for six investigated traits, which are correlated to each other and to the use of deeply concealed hosts, suggesting adaptation. Putatively adaptive traits showed a much stronger link among themselves than with an assemblage of 49 other morphological traits. However, estimation of the order of evolution in adaptive traits showed no structured pattern. The results indicate that the challenge of attacking deeply concealed hosts induced the repeated evolution of a "Dutilleul syndrome', named after the walker-through-walls' character from French literature. They also point towards a dynamic scenario in the evolution of complex functional systems. These findings highlight the power of morphology to illuminate poorly known aspects of natural history, and how hyperdiverse lineages can be used to understand the evolution of complex traits.

AB 1. Despite ongoing research in food web ecology and functional biogeography, the links between food web structure, functional traits and environmental conditions across spatial scales remain poorly understood. Trophic niches, defined as the amount of energy and elemental space occupied by species and food webs, may help bridge this divide.
   2. Here, we ask how the functional traits of species, the environmental conditions of habitats and the spatial scale of analysis jointly determine the characteristics of trophic niches. We used isotopic niches as a proxy of trophic niches, and conducted analyses at spatial scales ranging from local food webs and metacommunities to geographically distant sites.
   3. We sampled aquatic macroinvertebrates from 104 tank bromeliads distributed across five sites from Central to South America and compiled the macroinvertebrates' functional traits and stable isotope values (delta N-15 and delta C-13). We assessed how isotopic niches within each bromeliad were influenced by the functional trait composition of their associated invertebrates and environmental conditions (i.e., habitat size, canopy cover [CC] and detrital concentration [DC]). We then evaluated whether the diet of dominant predators and, consequently, energy pathways within food webs reflected functional and environmental changes among bromeliads across sites. At last, we determined the extent to which the isotopic niches of macroinvertebrates within each bromeliad contributed to the metacommunity isotopic niches within each site and compared these metacommunity-level niches over biogeographic scales.
   4. At the bromeliad level, isotopic niches increased with the functional richness of species in the food web and the DC in the bromeliad. The diet of top predators tracked shifts in prey biomass along gradients of CC and DC. Bromeliads that grew under heterogeneous CC displayed less trophic redundancy and therefore combined to form larger metacommunity isotopic niches. At last, the size of metacommunity niches depended on within-site heterogeneity in CC.
   5. Our results suggest that the trophic niches occupied by food webs can predictably scale from local food webs to metacommunities to biogeographic regions. This scaling process is determined by both the functional traits of species and heterogeneity in environmental conditions.

AB 1. Functional traits are commonly used in predictive models that link environmental drivers and community structure to ecosystem functioning. A prerequisite is to identify robust sets of continuous axes of trait variation, and to understand the ecological and evolutionary constraints that result in the functional trait space occupied by interacting species. Despite their diversity and role in ecosystem functioning, little is known of the constraints on the functional trait space of invertebrate biotas of entire biogeographic regions.
   2. We examined the ecological strategies and constraints underlying the realized trait space of aquatic invertebrates, using data on 12 functional traits of 852 taxa collected in tank bromeliads from Mexico to Argentina. Principal Component Analysis was used to reduce trait dimensionality to significant axes of trait variation, and the proportion of potential trait space that is actually occupied by all taxa was compared to null model expectations. Permutational Analyses of Variance were used to test whether trait combinations were clade-dependent.
   3. The major axes of trait variation represented life-history strategies optimizing resource use and antipredator adaptations. There was evidence for trophic, habitat, defence and life-history niche axes. Bromeliad invertebrates only occupied 16%-23% of the potential space within these dimensions, due to greater concentrations than predicted under uniform or normal distributions. Thus, despite high taxonomic diversity, invertebrates only utilized a small number of successful ecological strategies.
   4. Empty areas in trait space represented gaps between major phyla that arose from biological innovations, and trait combinations that are unviable in the bromeliad ecosystem. Only a few phylogenetically distant genera were neighbouring in trait space. Trait combinations aggregated taxa by family and then by order, suggesting that niche conservatism was a widespread mechanism in the diversification of ecological strategies.

AB Climate change exposes benthic species populations in coastal ecosystems to a combination of different stressors (e.g., warming, acidification and eutrophication), threatening the sustainability of the ecological functions they provide. Thermal stress appears to be one of the strongest drivers impacting marine ecosystems, acting across a wide range of scales, from individual metabolic performances to geographic distribution of populations. Accounting for and integrating the response of species functional traits to thermal stress is therefore a necessary step in predicting how populations will respond to the warming expected in coming decades. Here, we developed an individual-based population model using a mechanistic formulation of metabolic processes within the framework of the dynamic energy budget theory. Through a large number of simulations, we assessed the sensitivity of population growth potential to thermal stress and food conditions based on a climate projection scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway; RCP8.5: no reduction of greenhouse gas emissions). We focused on three bivalve species with contrasting thermal tolerance ranges and distinct distribution ranges along 5,000km of coastline in the NE Atlantic: the Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas), and two mussel species: Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis. Our results suggest substantial and contrasting changes within species depending on local temperature and food concentration. Reproductive phenology appeared to be a core process driving the responses of the populations, and these patterns were closely related to species thermal tolerances. The nonlinear relationship we found between individual life-history traits and response at the population level emphasizes the need to consider the interactions resulting from upscaling across different levels of biological organisation. These results underline the importance of a process-based understanding of benthic population response to seawater warming, which will be necessary for forward planning of resource management and strategies for conservation and adaptation to environmental changes.

AB Many studies have shown that the quality of biodiversity influences the well-being of citizens. Nevertheless, the drivers that shape biodiversity in urbanized zones are poorly understood. Although tree bases present reduced surface areas, they occur in great numbers in a deliberate spatial arrangement and may play an important ecological role in urban environments by offering limited favorable spaces for the development of spontaneous flora. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence the composition of plant communities harbored by tree bases in an urban district. We analyzed floristic inventory data collected in 2014 about plants growing at the bases of the 1474 trees on the 26 streets of the Bercy district in Paris (France).
   Our results indicated that the plant communities growing in the urban tree bases varied according to different factors. The abundance and distribution of these species were dependent on their biological traits (seed longevity in the soil bank) as well as the tree base characteristics (tree trunk diameter, equipment type around the tree bases, soil compaction, animal excrement, solar radiation, and urban tree species), the street orientation according to the air flow following the Seine River, and the geographic structure of the district (the influence of the presence of green spaces). The results of this study showed that the tree bases could be considered favorable stepping-stone habitats for certain species between more important green spaces such as parks and gardens. Thus, these areas actively participate in the enhancement of urban biodiversity.

AB Biological invasions are considered to be one of the main threats to biodiversity. Invasions lead to a loss of native species, changes to species composition, and a shift in the functioning and stability of ecosystems. In this study, derived from nine consecutive years of monitoring data and based on morphological functional trait values measured at the individual-level, we quantified the functional differences between native and non-native fish species and further assessed how biological invasions impact on species richness and functional diversity in the large subtropical Pearl River in southern China. Specifically, we differentiated intraspecific functional variability by separating individuals of a species according to their different life stages. Our results provided strong evidence that native and non-native fish were significantly different in their functional attributes. Invasion caused no obvious change in species richness; however, the yearly increase in non-native populations was accompanied by a significant decrease in functional niches of native species and change in several aspects of functional diversity in the fish community. Decreasing functional richness, and increasing functional divergence and specialization, indicated that most native species had been replaced by non-native species with different specific functional traits, which may affect ecosystem stability. Notably, this study provided empirical evidence that functional diversity was more sensitive to biological invasions than species richness. Our results show that control of non-native aquatic species is both necessary and urgent in the Pearl River. An understanding of the processes described in this study can form the basis of conservation in fish community, which is critical to sustainable and successful fisheries.

AB Flood pulses are the main force driving the dynamics of aquatic communities in floodplains. The responses of communities to environmental changes following flood pulses usually demand a time lag to appear and reach the climax. We assembled a data set of 16years of fish samplings to assess the relationship between water level and four functional diversity measures, in the upper Parana River floodplain. Specifically, we approached four aspects of each relationship between water level and functional diversity: nature (positive or negative), sensitivity (response intensity), responsiveness (response delay) and extent (response duration). The nature of the relationship between water level and functional diversity was positive in all cases. Functional richness (FRic) responded right after flood pulses, although with shorter extent. Abundance-dependent functional measures (evennessFEve; divergenceFDiv; and Rao's quadratic entropyRao's Q) presented delayed responses, reaching peaks more than 1.5years after flood pulses. Significant effects of floods on fish functional diversity were observed for more than 3years, although the highest functional diversity was observed with 1.8years, on average. More importantly, flood pulses had no longer significant effects on functional diversity after 4years. Regarding conservation strategies in regulated systems, flood events should occur every 2 or 3years, with adequate timing (October-November), intensity (up to 450cm) and duration (at least 50 uninterrupted days). Intervals longer than 3years or inadequate timing, intensity and duration could dramatically decrease functional diversity and compromise ecosystem services.

AB Fresh waters are increasingly threatened by flow modification. Knowledge about the impacts of flow modification is incomplete, especially in the tropics where ecological studies are only starting to emerge in recent years. Using presence/absence data dated approximately four decades apart (1966 to 2010) from 10 tropical rivers, we assessed the changes in freshwater fish assemblage and food web after flow modification. The sites were surveyed with methods best suited to habitat conditions (e.g., tray/push netting for low-order forest streams, visual surveys for canalised rivers and net casting for impounded rivers). With the presence/absence data, we derived and compared six measures of fish assemblage and food web structure: species richness, proportion of native species, overall functional diversity, native functional diversity, food web complexity and maximum trophic level. We found that changes in community assemblage and food web structure were not generalisable across modification regimes. In canalised sites, species richness and maximum trophic levels were lower in the second time period while the opposite was true for impounded sites. However, proportion of native species was consistently lower in the second time period across modification regimes. Changes in fish assemblages and food webs appear to be driven by species turnover. We recorded 79 cases of site-specific extirpation and 117 cases of site-specific establishment. Our data further suggest that turnover in assemblage is again contingent on flow-modification regime. While the process was stochastic in canalised rivers, benthopelagic species were more likely to be extirpated from impounded rivers where species lost were replaced by predominantly alien fish taxa.

AB River ecosystems are most often subject to multiple co-occurring anthropogenic stressors. Mediterranean streams are particularly affected by water scarcity and organic loads that commonly lead to a simultaneous reduction in flow and increasing depletion of dissolved oxygen.
   In the present study, the single and combined effects of water scarcity (flow velocity reduction) and dissolved oxygen depletion were used to evaluate alterations of drifting macroinvertebrates on a channel mesocosm system, by employing a multiple trait-based approach.
   Our main findings confirmed that the impact of the two combined stressors can be implicated in alterations of ecosystem functions as result of the changes in proportions of biological traits. Overall, our results showed that, individually, flow velocity reduction and a severe oxygen depletion promoted a shift in community traits. In more detail, biological traits describing the dispersal of organisms and their respiration showed the strongest responses. The respiration mode responded to low flow with drift increase of gill breathers and decrease of individuals with tegument, whereas dispersal was clearly affected by the combination of stressors. Resistance through eggs was higher with the single effect of flow reduction, while swimmers 'relative abundance increased in individuals that drift after exposure to the combination of stressors. Thus, while flow reduction alone is expected to specifically filter out the gill breathers and the egg producers, the combination of stressors will impact more drastically organism's dispersal and swimmers. Such changes in biological traits can result in variations in ecosystem functioning through, for example, local changes in biomass, secondary production, stream metabolism as well as resulting in biodiversity losses or alterations of its distribution patterns.

AB Little is known about the differences in patterns and drivers between species richness (SR) and functional diversity (FD) in aquatic plants at large scales, and the underlying assembly mechanisms are not well studied. We compared SR and FD patterns of aquatic plant assemblages in 29 subtropical lakes, and detected the underlying assembly rules. Environmental drivers of SR and FD were revealed by GLM and GAM models, and the relative importance of assembly rules was determined by a null model approach. SR and FD of aquatic plants presented different patterns and drivers in this region. SR was significantly correlated with geographic, hydrological and water quality variables. We found a lower functional richness but higher functional evenness and divergence in the highland lakes. There was no significant correlation between functional richness and environmental variables. Null model analyses showed that most values of standardized effect size were located between the confidence interval, indicating a dominance of randomness. Deterministic processes such as limiting similarity and habitat filtering were also important in individual lakes. Habitat filtering plays a stronger role shaping the hydrophyte assemblages especially with the increase of elevation, area and AWLF (amplitude of water level fluctuation). Our results demonstrated that FD, in contrast to SR, were more resistant to environmental variations, and hydrology played an important role in shaping both SR and FD patterns in lake ecosystems. Furthermore, we revealed complex assembly rules and emphasized the importance of both stochastic and deterministic mechanisms in structuring aquatic plant assemblages at the regional scale.

AB Aquatic plant meadows are valuable components to the 'coastal filter' and it is important to understand the processes that drive their ability to cycle nutrients. However, at present, the field-based evidence for understanding the drivers of nutrient uptake by plants is lacking. This study aimed to investigate how well individual shoots of aquatic plants could meet their nitrogen demands using the sediment nutrient pool (porewater ammonium) and to explore which traits helped to facilitate such uptake. Several species were investigated in shallow, submerged (2-4 m) mixed-species communities in the northern Baltic Sea using incubation experiments with enriched ammonium. After a 3.5 h incubation time, individuals were collected and analysed for nitrogen (% DW) and N-15 (at-%) concentrations. Uptake by plants was calculated per unit nitrogen in response to the N-15 labelled source and to overall nitrogen availability. Background porewater ammonium availability was highly variable between individual plants. Species identity did not significantly affect uptake metrics and the effect of ambient porewater availability was weak. As biomass increased there were significant logarithmic declines in the 95th quantiles of nutrient uptake rates, ambient porewater nutrient availability and aboveground nitrogen tissue concentrations (% DW). Such findings suggested that uptake rates of plants were significantly demand driven and the nutrient conditions of the porewater were significantly driven by the demands of the plant. Findings parameterised the unfulfilled potential for some aquatic plants to cycle nutrients more efficiently and highlighted the potential importance of access to new nutrient sources as a way of enhancing nutrient cycling by aquatic plants. Plant traits and community properties such as the activity of infauna could facilitate such an access and are likely important for nutrient uptake.

AB Holocrinid crinoids (Holocrinus) are among the oldest, if not the oldest, post-Paleozoic crinoids, which are widely considered the stem-group isocrinids for the post-Paleozoic monophyletic subclass Articulata. Owing to their phylogenetic and stratigraphic position, the morphology and paleobiology of these crinoids have received considerable attention. Although the holocrinid stalk is similar to that of fossil and living isocrinids, it lacks flat and rigid synostosial articulations, which are sites specialized for autotomy. Holocrinids were thus long considered sessile, without the ability to re-attach. However, taphonomic data, such as specific pattern of preferred disarticulation at the distal facet of nodals, indicated that Holocrinus was likely capable of stalk autotomy and relocation. This trait, that is considered an anti-predatory adaptation against benthic predation, has recently served as example of fundamental change in benthic marine communities, such as the Mesozoic marine revolution (MMR). Here I describe stereom microstructure of the stalk of Early-Middle Triassic Holocrinus. The holocrinid stalk is mainly constructed of straight stereom passageways passing through the columnals, that are diagnostic of long through-going ligaments. At the distal symplexial nodal facet, however, fine and dense stereom, in which pores are irregular in outline and show no alignment, is observed. The latter stereom type strongly resembles synostosial stereom in living isocrinids, that is associated with short ligaments, specifically designed for autotomy. These findings thus strongly support stalk shedding abilities in holocrinids. These results emphasize that microstructural observations, coupled with taphonomic data, may provide more insights into functional inferences than macromorphological data alone.

AB Hydrological alterations in Alpine rivers have been largely increasing due to the combined effects of global climate change and local impacts. Water flow intermittency starts with a process called lentification, which leads to the transformation of the aquatic ecosystem with severe consequences on biotic communities. These consequences have a greater impact in Alpine headwater streams, which are considered important and fragile hotspots of biodiversity and a source of threatened species; the new regime creates conditions to which native biota are poorly adapted. The main aim of our work was to evaluate taxonomical, functional and structural changes of diatom communities in Alpine rivers during the lentification process that precedes a supra-seasonal drought. Contrary to what was expected, communities exposed to river shrinking showed a level of homogeneity comparable to those collected in permanent sections. We therefore hypothesized that lentification created an intermediate disturbance that favoured heterogeneity of assemblages. Conversely, ecological guilds, growth forms and eco-morphological groups varied along temporal and spatial gradients driven by the lentification process. Small, motile and medium-sized low profile species were more abundant during summer, as well as adnate and stalked ones. Lentification limited the presence of high profile guilds and mucous-forming colonies. Droughts in Alpine streams are fairly recent processes, and the dynamics of aquatic communities facing water scarcity are largely unknown. The results we obtained provide important insights towards a more refined functional classification of diatoms for evaluating hydrological alterations.

AB Evidence from terrestrial ecosystems indicates that biodiversity relates to ecosystem functions (BEF), but this relationship varies in its strength, in part, as a function of habitat connectivity and fragmentation. In primary producers, common proxies of ecosystem function include productivity and resource use efficiency. In aquatic primary producers, macroecological studies have observed BEF variance, where ecosystems with lower richness show stronger BEF relationships. However, aquatic ecosystems are less affected by habitat fragmentation than terrestrial systems and the mechanism underlying this BEF variance has been largely overlooked. Here, we provide a mechanistic explanation of BEF variance using a trait-based, numerical model parameterized for phytoplankton. Resource supply in our model fluctuates recurrently, similar to many coastal systems. Our findings show that following an extinction event, the BEF relationship can be driven by the species that are the most efficient resource users. Specifically, in species-rich assemblages, increased redundancy of efficient resource users minimizes the risk of losing function following an extinction event. On the other hand, in species-poor assemblages, low redundancy of efficient resource users increases the risk of losing ecosystem function following extinctions. Furthermore, we corroborate our findings with what has been observed from large-scale field studies on phytoplankton.

AB Domesticated Atlantic salmon grow much faster than wild salmon when reared together in fish tanks under farming conditions (size ratios typically 1:2-3). In contrast, domesticated salmon only display marginally higher growth than wild salmon when reared together in rivers (size ratios typically 1:1-1.2). This begs the question why? Is this a difference in the plastic response driven by divergent energy budgets between the two environments, or is it a result of selection, whereby domesticated salmon that display the greatest growth-potential are those at greatest risk of mortality in the wild? We reared domesticated, hybrid and wild salmon in a river until they smoltified at age 2 or 4, and thereafter in fish tanks for a further 2 years. In the river, there was no difference in the mean size between the groups. In contrast, after being transferred from the river to fish tanks, the domesticated salmon significantly outgrew the wild salmon (maximum size ratio of similar to 1:1.8). This demonstrates that selection alone cannot be responsible for the lack of growth differences observed between domesticated and wild salmon in rivers. Nevertheless, the final size ratios observed after rearing in tanks were lower than expected in that environment, thus suggesting that plasticity, as for selection, cannot be the sole mechanism. We therefore conclude that a combination of energy-budget plasticity, and selection via growth-potential mortality, cause the differences in growth reaction norms between domesticated and wild salmon across these contrasting environments. Our results imply that if phenotypic changes are not observed in wild populations following introgression of domesticated conspecifics, it does not mean that functional genetic changes have not occurred in the admixed population. Clearly, under the right environmental conditions, the underlying genetic changes will manifest themselves in the phenotype.

AB Arctic freshwater basins are diversity hotspots and sentinels of climate change, but their long-term variability and the environmental variables controlling them are not well defined. We examined four available lake sediment sequences from High Arctic Svalbard for their subfossil Chironomidae communities, biodiversity and functional traits and assessed the influence of climatic and limnological variability on the long-term ecological dynamics. Our results indicated that collector-filterers had an important role in the oligotrophic sites, whereas collector-gatherers dominated the nutrient-enriched sites with significant bird guano inputs. In the oligotrophic sites, benthic production, taxon richness and taxonomic and functional diversity were highest during the early Holocene, when temperatures showed a rapid increase. An increase in subfossil abundance and diversity metrics was also found in recent samples of the oligotrophic sites, but not in the bird-impacted sites, where the trends were decreasing. When partitioning out the environmental forcing on chironomid communities, the influence of climate was significant in all the sites, whereas in-lake production (organic matter) was significant in two of the sites and catchment erosion (magnetic susceptibility) had only minor influence. The findings suggest that major changes in Arctic chironomid assemblages were driven by climate warming with increasing diversity in oligotrophic sites, but deteriorating ecological functions in environmentally stressed sites. We found that although taxonomic and functional diversity were always coupled, taxonomical and functional turnovers were coupled only in the oligotrophic sites suggesting that the ecological functions operated by chironomids in these low productivity sites may not be as resilient to future environmental change.

AB Regressive evolution involves the degradation of formerly useful traits as organisms invade novel ecological niches. In animals, committing to a strict subterranean habit can lead to regression of the eyes, likely due to a limited exposure to light. Several lineages of subterranean mammals show evidence of such degeneration, which can include decreased organization of the retina, malformation of the lens, and subcutaneous positioning of the eye. Advances in DNA sequencing have revealed that this regression co-occurs with a degradation of genomic loci encoding visual functions, including protein-coding genes. Other dim light-adapted vertebrates with normal ocular anatomy, such as nocturnal and aquatic species, also demonstrate evidence of visual gene loss, but the absence of comparative studies has led to the untested assumption that subterranean mammals are special in the degree of this genomic regression. Additionally, previous studies have shown that not all vision genes have been lost in subterranean mammals, but it is unclear whether they are under relaxed selection and will ultimately be lost, are maintained due to pleiotropy or if natural selection is favoring the retention of the eye and certain critical underlying loci. Here I report that vision gene loss in subterranean mammals tends to be more extensive in quantity and differs in distribution from other dim light-adapted mammals, although some committed subterranean mammals demonstrate significant overlap with nocturnal microphthalmic species. In addition, blind subterranean mammals retain functional orthologs of non-pleiotropic visual genes that are evolving at rates consistent with purifying selection. Together, these results suggest that although living underground tends to lead to major losses of visual functions, natural selection is maintaining genes that support the eye, perhaps as an organ for circadian and/or circannual entrainment.

AB Incorporating imperfect detection when estimating species richness has become commonplace in the past decade. However, the question of how imperfect detection of species affects estimates of functional and phylogenetic community structure remains untested. We used long-term counts of breeding bird species that were detected at least once on islands in a land-bridge island system, and employed multi-species occupancy models to assess the effects of imperfect detection of species on estimates of bird diversity and community structure by incorporating species traits and phylogenies. Our results showed that taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity were all underestimated significantly as a result of species' imperfect detection, with taxonomic diversity showing the greatest bias. The functional and phylogenetic structure calculated from observed communities were both more clustered than those from the detection-corrected communities due to missed distinct species. The discrepancy between observed and estimated diversity differed according to the measure of biodiversity employed. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for species' imperfect detection in biodiversity studies, especially for functional and phylogenetic community ecology, and when attempting to infer community assembly processes. With datasets that allow for detection-corrected community structure, we can better estimate diversity and infer the underlying mechanisms that structure community assembly, and thus make reliable management decisions for the conservation of biodiversity.

AB This research addressed the question of whether invertebrate food web structure varied between a native and an invasive macrophyte leaf species in the littoral zone of a tropical reservoir. We compared macroinvertebrate herbivore functional trait diversity composition with food web structure on the two macrophyte leaves, the invasive white ginger lily (Hedichium coronarium-Zingiberaceae) and the native pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata-Pontederiaceae). We predicted that the herbivore macroinvertebrate trait indices would decrease with macrophyte leaf species due to a lower resource quality with the flow-on effects in the food web structure. We calculated the number of functionally singular species (sing.sp) and herbivore functional trait richness (FRic) indices. For the macroinvertebrate food webs, we calculated the total number of trophic links (L), link density (L/S), connectance (C) and predator-prey ratios using a predator-prey matrix. We analysed the relationship between chemical traits of the macrophyte species' leaves herbivore traits and food web indices using multivariate regression and Pearson's correlation. Hedichium coronarium leaves had higher biomass and higher nitrogen content than the native P. cordata, which had higher phosphorus and carbohydrate content. Pontederia cordata leaves were associated with specialist macroinvertebrate species which primarily feed on biofilms (e.g. Ulmeritrus and Scirtidae) and plant leaves (e.g. Beardius). Food webs on P. cordata had lower numbers of trophic links (L), links per species (L/S) and predator-prey ratios. Connectance, which represents food web complexity, was similar between macroinvertebrate assemblages on the two leaf types. Our study suggests that chemical compounds of macrophyte leaves quality may have potential flow-on effects on food web structure.

AB We aimed to evaluate the structure of periphytic algae communities, the trait distribution and the patterns of functional diversity in the last non-dammed stretch of the Upper Parana River floodplain. We hypothesize that there is an increase in the functional diversity and a change of the traits and environmental variables structure along this floodplain. We expected an increase in the functional diversity due to the increase in tributaries propagule input leading to a functional divergence, provided by deterministic processes. The sampling was in channels, lakes and rivers in a floodplain area covering 230 km of extension of the main river. The periphyton was obtained from scraping petioles of the floating macrophyte Eichhornia azurea (Sw.) Kunth. The traits evaluated were life form and strength and form of adherence to the substrate. The functional diversity was calculated from a functional dendrogram and assembly rules. The hypotheses proposed in this study were partially accepted, since there was no increase in functional diversity along the sampled area, but we observed a change in the structure of the functional traits along the different stretches of the floodplain. The results showed diatoms as the dominant algae, and functional convergence as the assembly rule prevalent for this community. There was a large difference between local environmental factors along the floodplain. The protected areas housed the greatest functional diversity values, which was apparently influenced by the increase in functional diversity, which can be explained by the limnological factors and the input of propagules from the tributaries to the Parana River. We noted the importance of the protected areas and local factors for assembly of this community.

AB 1. Many riparian ecosystems in Mediterranean Europe are affected by land use and flow alteration by dams. We focused on understanding how these stressors and their components affect riparian forests in the region. We asked the following questions: (1) Are there well-defined, responsive riparian guilds? (2) Do dam-induced streamflows determine abundance and distribution of riparian guilds? (3) What are the main drivers governing composition and cover of riparian guilds in regulated rivers?
   2. We inventoried the cover of riparian woody species in free-flowing rivers and downstream of dams. We performed a cluster analysis and ordination to derive riparian guilds, using abundance data from 66 riparian woody species and 26 functional plant traits. We used a reduced set of principal components for the environment, land use and hydrology, and general linear modelling to explore the effect of these factors (separately and combined) on riparian guilds.
   3. We found that: (1) four dominant guilds are responsive to disturbance in southwestern European streams, namely the obligate riparian, water-stress tolerant, deciduous competitive and Mediterranean evergreen guilds; (2) a set of land use and hydrological variables differentially affect the diverse co-occurring riparian guilds; (3) frequency and duration of high flow pulses and the low-flow conditions were major drivers of change in landscapes dominated by intensive agriculture and forestry; (4) storage reservoirs reduced the cover of obligate riparian and Mediterranean evergreen guilds, and increased the abundance of water-stress tolerant and deciduous competitive guilds, while run-of-river dams, having limited water storage, reduced both obligate and deciduous competitive guilds.

AB Aquatic animals are frequently suffered from starvation due to restricted food availability or deprivation. It is currently known that gut microbiota assists host in nutrient acquisition. Thus, exploring the gut microbiota responses would improve our understanding on physiological adaptation to starvation. To achieve this, we investigated how the gut microbiota and shrimp digestion and immune activities were affected under starvation stress. The results showed that the measured digestion activities in starved shrimp were significantly lower than in normal cohorts; while the measured immune activities exhibited an opposite trend. A structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that changes in the gut bacterial community were directly related to digestive and immune enzyme activities, which in turn markedly affected shrimp growth traits. Notably, several gut bacterial indicators that characterized the shrimp nutrient status were identified, with more abundant opportunistic pathogens in starved shrimp, although there were no statistical differences in the overall diversity and the structures of gut bacterial communities between starved and normal shrimp. Starved shrimp exhibited less connected and cooperative interspecies interaction as compared with normal cohorts. Additionally, the functional pathways involved in carbohydrate and protein digestion, glycan biosynthesis, lipid and enzyme metabolism remarkably decreased in starved shrimp. These attenuations could increase the susceptibility of starved shrimp to pathogens infection. In summary, this study provides novel insights into the interplay among shrimp digestion, immune activities and gut microbiota in response to starvation stress.

AB Allelopathic species can alter biodiversity. Using simulated assemblages that are characterised by neutrality, lumpy coexistence and intransitivity, we explore relationships between within-assemblage competitive dissimilarities and resistance to allelopathic species. An emergent behaviour from our models is that assemblages are more resistant to allelopathy when members strongly compete exploitatively (high competitive power). We found that neutral assemblages were the most vulnerable to allelopathic species, followed by lumpy and then by intransitive assemblages. We find support for our modeling in real-world time-series data from eight lakes of varied morphometry and trophic state. Our analysis of this data shows that a lake's history of allelopathic phytoplankton species biovolume density and dominance is related to the number of species clusters occurring in the plankton assemblages of those lakes, an emergent trend similar to that of our modeling. We suggest that an assemblage's competitive power determines its allelopathy resistance.

AB The origin and maintenance of biodiversity and the influence of human activities on biodiversity are issues of central interest to scientists as well as policymakers. We conceptualized the integration of metacommunity paradigms across space and time to better understand the community organization of fish under the hydrological control mechanisms of large river floodplains. In our analysis of variation partitioning and functional ecology, patchy dynamics and mass effects represent special cases of species-sorting paradigms generated by neutral processes in certain species, and the relative roles of neutral processes and local adaptations may increase along with the spatio-temporal extent. The effect of flood event timing, floodplain elevation and vegetation cover on species abundance determined the distribution of seasonal patchy heterogeneous habitats. Spatio-temporal structures were observed among patches of the same habitat types across years but within habitat patches in the same year. The convergence of life history traits and respiratory modes of species associated with different habitat types was not significant, and traits could present overall seasonality within patches and segregation among patches of the same habitat types across years. Furthermore, the similarity of these traits was explained by phylogenetic relationships. At the spatio-temporal scale of the present study, the origin of lineage-specific allometric effects in fish, the origin of habitat specialization and their consequences for metacommunity dynamics were not clear. These results are most likely related to species-sorting processes, in which the species adapted to a specific type of habitat ex situ subsequently colonized an area after it was altered via human activities.

AB Burrowing benthic animals belonging to the same functional group may produce species-specific effects on microbially mediated nitrogen (N) processes depending upon different ecological traits. We investigated the effects of two tube-dwelling organisms, amphipods (Corophium insidiosum) and chironomid larvae (Chironomus plumosus), on benthic N cycling in bioturbated estuarine sediments. Aims of this work were to analyze the interactions among burrowers and N-related microbial processes in two distinct sedimentary environments colonized by benthic animals with different ecological traits. We hypothesized higher rates of nitrification and higher coupled nitrification-denitrification in sediments with C. insidiosum due to continuous ventilation rates. We expected higher denitrification of water column nitrate in sediments with C. plumosus due to lower and intermittent ventilation activity and lower oxygen levels in burrows. To this purpose, we combined process-specific (nitrification and denitrification) with net N flux measurements in intact and reconstructed sediments. Sediments with C. insidiosum had higher rates of oxygen demand and of potential nitrification and higher concentration of pore water NH4 (+) as compared to sediments with C. plumosus. Sediments with both species displayed comparable net N-2 fluxes, mostly sustained by respiration of water column NO3 (-) in sediments with chironomid larvae and by NO3 (-) produced within sediments in sediments with corophiid amphipods. Corophium insidiosum stimulated nitrification nearly 15-fold more as compared to C. plumosus. Overall, our results demonstrate that sediments with burrowing fauna may display similar rates of denitrification, but underlying mechanisms may deeply vary and be species-specific.

AB Bivalves may play a major role in structuring aquatic communities. This may be especially relevant in aquatic communities dominated by non-native invasive bivalves, which can contribute to the increase of habitat homogenization. In this study, we assess how habitat homogenization, through the reduction of empty bivalve shells identities, influences the macroinvertebrate assemblages. Towards this end, a manipulative experiment with the empty shells of two native (Potomida littoralis and Unio delphinus) and one non-native (Corbicula fluminea) species was performed. Seven treatments were prepared, three of them consisting of homogeneous substrates using shells of one species, and four of them consisting in heterogeneous substrates using more than one species. The associated fauna colonizing different treatments was analyzed through taxonomic and trait-based approaches. Our results showed that the substrate complexity influenced the density of macroinvertebrates, with the heterogeneous treatments significantly yielding more dense assemblages. Also, the trait patterns differed among the levels of habitat heterogeneity, influencing mainly organisms that feed on microphytes of both small and big sizes, that inhabit areas with slow to moderate water flow, and that have short and long live cycles. Further, the functional diversity was not influenced by the substrate heterogeneity. Therefore, the habitat homogenization, through the accumulation of non-native C. flumineaempty shells in the river bottom, did not affect the functional diversity of the macroinvertebrate assemblages.

AB Although many studies have investigated the effects of disturbance and environmental drivers on marine ecosystems, comparatively few have studied their interactions. Using fuzzy coded biological traits, we compared the functional composition, diversity and evenness of benthic communities in the English Channel and in the Celtic and Irish Seas across interacting gradients of bottom trawling and primary production. Fuzzy correspondence analysis indicated greater similarity in trait composition at sites of high trawling pressure than at those of low trawling. In contrast, the analysis revealed no relationship between trait composition and primary production. Trawling and primary production had no effect on the traits 'longevity', 'sediment position', or 'feeding mode'. However, trawling had negative effects on all modalities within the trait 'living habit', and these effects were strongest for attached and epifaunal organisms but weakest for burrow- and tube-dwelling species. Trawling also negatively affected most modalities within the trait 'maximum weight', with strongest effects for organisms weighing between <0.1 g and up to 1 kg. Conversely, trawling positively affected organisms weighing >10 kg. For the trait 'bioturbation', upward conveyors were positively related with primary production, whilst other modalities exhibited no clear pattern. Because trawling affected some traits more than others, community biomass was less evenly distributed across traits in highly trawled areas, which resulted in lower levels of functional diversity and evenness. Overall, the effects of bottom trawling were greater in areas of high primary production.

AB Organic enrichment, especially from anthropogenic sources, is one of the current threats to coastal marine biodiversity. Organic enrichment occurs mainly in sheltered soft bottoms, characterized by fine sediments, and results in multiple changes in the benthic habitat, including hypoxia and an increased concentration of compounds that are toxic to marine invertebrates. We report on the results of a microcosm-based experiment (duration = 30 d), quantifying the effects of organic enrichment on taxonomic and functional diversity of nematode assemblages from an open/closed coastal lagoon of South America (Rocha Lagoon, Uruguay). In open/closed lagoons, the input of organic matter becomes a major disturbance due the limitation in water renewal. In our experiment, enrichment led to reductions in abundance, richness and trophic diversity of the nematode assemblage. Rapid reductions in total abundance (after 4 d) were registered, while richness decreased only towards the end of the experiment (similar to 30 d). Trophic changes were characterized by loss of predators/omnivores and dominance of selective deposit-feeders and epigrowth-feeders. By contrast, we did not find any selective effect of enrichment associated with life history traits (e.g. maturity index). Overall, these findings have 2 important implications for the conservation and monitoring of the health of coastal lagoons: first, monitoring of nematode assemblages at the genus level is sufficient to detect enrichment effects; second, an index of trophic diversity would be a good indicator of the effects of enrichment on natural communities.

AB The lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) is one of the most economically and ornamentally important perennial aquatic plants. Plant architecture is an important trait for lotus classification, cultivation, breeding, and applications. In this study, traits representing plant architecture were measured in 390 lotus germplasms for 3 years. According to the phenotypic distribution, 21 large architecture (LA) and 22 small architecture (SA) germplasms exhibiting extreme phenotypes were selected as representatives of plant architecture. Microscopy analyses revealed that LA lotuses possessed far more vertical cells and longer cell lengths than SA lotuses, and there was a closer linear relationship between vertical cell number and plant architecture than cell length and plant architecture. Furthermore, based on whole genome re-sequencing data from 10 LA and 10 SA lotus germplasms, fixation index (F-ST) genome scan identified 11.02 Mb of genomic regions that were highly differentiated between the LA and SA lotus groups. Chi-square test revealed that 17,154 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1,554 insertions and deletions (InDels) showed distinct allelic distribution between the LA and SA lotus groups within these regions. A total of 126 variants with distinct allelic distribution in the highly differentiated region were predicted to cause amino acid changes in 60 genes. Among the 41 genes with functional annotation, the expression patterns of six genes involved in cell division and cell wall construction were confirmed using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, 34 plant architecture-associated InDel markers were developed and verified in the remaining 11 LA and 12 SA lotus plant architecture representatives. This study identified promising functional markers and candidates for molecular breeding and will facilitate further elucidation of the genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in the lotus.

AB An understanding of the balance of interspecific competition and the physical environment in structuring organismal communities is crucial because those communities structured primarily by their physical environment typically exhibit greater sensitivity to environmental change than those structured predominantly by competitive interactions. Here, using detailed phylogenetic and functional information, we investigate this question in macrofaunal assemblages from Northwest Atlantic Ocean continental slopes, a high seas region projected to experience substantial environmental change through the current century. We demonstrate assemblages to be both phylogenetically and functionally under-dispersed, and thus conclude that the physical environment, not competition, may dominate in structuring deep-ocean communities. Further, we find temperature and bottom trawling intensity to be among the environmental factors significantly related to assemblage diversity. These results hint that deep-ocean communities are highly sensitive to their physical environment and vulnerable to environmental perturbation, including by direct disturbance through fishing, and indirectly through the changes brought about by climate change.

AB Sponges are ubiquitous on coral reefs, mostly long lived and therefore adaptive to changing environmental conditions. They feed on organic matter withdrawn from the passing water and they may harbor microorganisms (endosymbionts), which contribute to their nutrition. Their diets and stable isotope (SI) fractionation determine the SI signature of the sponge holobiont. Little is known of spatio-temporal variations in SI signatures of delta C-13 and delta N-15 in tropical sponges and whether they reflect variations in the environment. We investigated the SI signatures of seven common sponge species with different functional traits and their potential food sources between 15 and 32 m depth along the S-SE and E-NE side of the Saba Bank, Eastern Caribbean, in October 2011 and October 2013. SI signatures differed significantly between most sponge species, both in mean values and in variation, indicating different food preferences and/or fractionation, inferring sponge species-specific isotopic niche spaces. In 2011, all sponge species at the S-SE side were enriched in delta C-13 compared to the E-NE side. In 2013, SI signatures of sponges did not differ between the two sides and were overall lighter in delta C-13 and delta N-15 than in 2011. Observed spatio-temporal changes in SI in sponges could not be attributed to changes in the SI signatures of their potential food sources, which remained stable with different SI signatures of pelagic (particulate organic matter (POM): delta C-13 -24.9%0, delta N-15 +4.3%o) and benthic-derived food (macroalgae: delta C-13 -15.4%o, delta N-15 +0.8%o). Enriched delta C-13 signatures in sponges at the S-SE side in 2011 are proposed to be attributed to predominantly feeding on benthic-derived C. This interpretation was supported by significant differences in water mass constituents between sides in October 2011. Elevated NO3 and dissolved organic matter concentrations point toward a stronger reef signal in reef overlying water at the S-SE than N-NE side of the Bank in 2011. The depletions of delta C-13 and delta N-15 in sponges in October 2013 compared to October 2011 concurred with significantly elevated POM concentrations. The contemporaneous decrease in delta N-15 suggests that sponges obtain their N mostly from benthic-derived food with a lower delta N-15 than pelagic food. Average proportional feeding on available sources varied between sponge species and ranged from 20% to 50% for benthic and 50% to 80% for pelagic-derived food, assuming trophic enrichment factors of 0.5%0 +/- sd 0.5 for delta C-13 and 3%o +/- sd 0.5 for delta N-15 for sponges. We suggest that observed variation of SI in sponges between sides and years were the result of shifts in the proportion of ingested benthic- and pelagic-derived organic matter driven by environmental changes. We show that sponge SI signatures reflect environmental variability in space and time on the Saba Bank and that SI of sponges irrespective of their species-specific traits move in a similar direction in response to these environmental changes.

AB Microbial interactions play a key role in ecosystem functioning, with nutrient availability as an important determinant. Although phylogenetically distant bacteria and fungi commonly co-occur in nature, information on their cross-kingdom interactions under unstable, extreme environments remains poor. Hence, the aims of this work were to evaluate potential in vitro interactions among fungi and bacteria isolated from a phosphorous oligotrophic aquatic system in the Cuatro Cienegas Basin, Mexico, and to test the nutrients-based shifts. We assessed growth changes in bacteria (Aeromonas and Vibrio) and fungi (Coprinellus micaceus, Cladosporium sp., and Aspergillus niger) on co-cultures in relation to monocultures under diverse nutrient scenarios on Petri dishes. Interactions were explored using a network analysis, and a metabolome profiling for specific taxa. We identified nutrient-dependent patterns, as beneficial interactions dominated in low-nutrients media and antagonistic interactions dominated in rich media. This suggests that cross-kingdom synergistic interactions might favor microbial colonization and growth under low nutrient conditions, representing an adaptive trait to oligotrophic environments. Moreover, our findings agree with the stress-gradient hypothesis, since microbial interactions shifted from competition to cooperation as environmental stress (expressed as low nutrients) increased. At a functional level consistent differences were detected in the production of secondary metabolites, agreeing with plate bioassays. Our results based on culture experiments, provides evidence to understand the complexity of microbial dynamics and survival in phosphorous-depleted environments.

AB Microplastic is a contaminant of concern worldwide. Rivers are implicated as major pathways of microplastic transport to marine and lake ecosystems, and microplastic ingestion by freshwater biota is a risk associated with microplastic contamination, but there is little research on microplastic ecology within freshwater ecosystems. Microplastic uptake by fish is likely affected by environmental microplastic abundance and aspects of fish ecology, but these relationships have rarely been addressed. We measured the abundance and composition of microplastic in fish and surface waters from 3 major tributaries of Lake Michigan, USA. Microplastic was detected in fish and surface waters from all 3 sites, but there was no correlation between microplastic concentrations in fish and surface waters. Rather, there was a significant effect of functional feeding group on microplastic concentration in fish. Neogobius melanostomus (round goby, a zoobenthivore) had the highest concentration of gut microplastic (19 particles fish-1) compared to 10 other fish taxa measured, and had a positive linear relationship between body size and number of microplastic particles. Surface water microplastic concentrations were lowest in the most northern, forested watershed, and highest in the most southern, agriculturally dominated watershed. Results suggest microplastic pollution is common in river food webs and is connected to species feeding characteristics. Future research should focus on understanding the movement of microplastic from point-source and diffuse sources and into aquatic ecosystems, which will support pollution management efforts on inland waters.

AB Plant hydraulic conductivity (K) refers to the rate of water flow (kg s(-1)) per unit pressure drop (MPa), which drives flow through the plant organ system. It is an important eco-physiology index for measuring plant water absorption and transport capacity. A field study was conducted in the arid region of the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China, plant hydraulic conductivity was measured by high-pressure flowmeter (HPFM) to investigate the characteristics of hydraulic conductivity of typical dominant desert plants (Reaumuria soongarica M., Nitraria sphaerocarpa M., and Sympegma regelii B.) and their relationship with functional traits of leaves, stems, and roots, and explaining their adaptation strategies to desert environment from the perspective of plant organs hydraulic conductivity. The results showed that the hydraulic conductivity of the leaves and stems of R. soongarica and N. sphaerocarpa (K-LA, leaf hydraulic conductivity per unit leaf area; K-LW, leaf hydraulic conductivity per unit leaf weight; K-SLA, stem hydraulic conductivity per unit leaf area; K-SLW, stem hydraulic conductivity per unit leaf weight) were significantly lower than those of S. regelii, while their fine root (K-RL, root hydraulic conductivity per unit leaf length; K-RSA, root hydraulic conductivity per unit root surface area) and whole root (K-TRW, whole root hydraulic conductivity per unit root weight) of hydraulic conductivity were significantly higher than those of S. regelii. In addition, K-LA and K-LW, K-SLA and K-SLW, and K-RL and K-RSA in three desert plants all exhibited consistent trends. Correlation analysis illustrated that the hydraulic conductivity of leaves and stems had a significantly positive correlation, but they had no significant negative correlation with the specific leaf weight (SLW, specific leaf weight). The hydraulic conductivity of fine root weight (K-RW, root hydraulic conductivity per unit root weight) and specific root surface area (SRSA, specific root surface area) showed significantly positive correlation (r = 0.727, P < 0.05). The results demonstrated that the R. soongarica and N. sphaerocarpa preserved their water content through the strong leaf absorption capacity of soil water and the low water dispersion rates of leaves to adapt to the harsher arid habitat, which is more drought tolerant than S. regelii.

AB Lakes and their topological distribution across Earth's surface impose ecological and evolutionary constraints on aquatic metacommunities. In this study, we group similar lake ecosystems as metacommunity units influencing diatom community structure. We assembled a database of 195 lakes from the tropical Andes and adjacent lowlands (8 degrees N-30 degrees S and 58-79 degrees W) with associated environmental predictors to examine diatom metacommunity patterns at two different levels: taxon and functional (deconstructed species matrix by ecological guilds). We also derived spatial variables that inherently assessed the relative role of dispersal. Using complementary multivariate statistical techniques (principal component analysis, cluster analysis, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, Procrustes, variance partitioning), we examined diatom-environment relationships among different lake habitats (sediment surface, periphyton, and plankton) and partitioned community variation to evaluate the influence of niche- and dispersal-based assembly processes in diatom metacommunity structure across lake clusters. The results showed a significant association between geographic clusters of lakes based on gradients of climate and landscape configuration and diatom assemblages. Six lake clusters distributed along a latitudinal gradient were identified as functional metacommunity units for diatom communities. Variance partitioning revealed that dispersal mechanisms were a major contributor to diatom metacommunity structure, but in a highly context-dependent fashion across lake clusters. In the Andean Altiplano and adjacent lowlands of Bolivia, diatom metacommunities are niche assembled but constrained by either dispersal limitation or mass effects, resulting from area, environmental heterogeneity, and ecological guild relationships. Topographic heterogeneity played an important role in structuring planktic diatom metacommunities. We emphasize the value of a guild-based metacommunity model linked to dispersal for elucidating mechanisms underlying latitudinal gradients in distribution. Our findings reveal the importance of shifts in ecological drivers across climatic and physiographically distinct lake clusters, providing a basis for comparison of broad-scale community gradients in lake-rich regions elsewhere. This may help guide future research to explore evolutionary constraints on the rich Neotropical benthic diatom species pool.

AB Algal-bacterial interactions play a major role in shaping diversity of algal associated bacterial communities. Temporal variation in bacterial phylogenetic composition reflects changes of these complex interactions which occur during the algal growth cycle as well as throughout the lifetime of algal blooms. Viruses are also known to cause shifts in bacterial community diversity which could affect algal bloom phases. This study investigated on changes of bacterial and viral abundances, bacterial physiological status, and on bacterial successional pattern associated with the harmful benthic dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf. ovata in batch cultures over the algal growth cycle. Bacterial community phylogenetic structure was assessed by 16S rRNA gene ION torrent sequencing. A comparison between bacterial community retrieved in cultures and that one co-occurring in situ during the development of the O. cf. ovata bloom from where the algal strain was isolated was also reported. Bacterial community growth was characterized by a biphasic pattern with the highest contributions (similar to 60%) of highly active bacteria found at the two bacterial exponential growth steps. An alphaproteobacterial consortium composed by the Rhodobacteraceae Dinoroseobacter (22.2%-35.4%) and Roseovarius (5.7%-18.3%), together with Oceanicaulis (14.2- 40.3%), was strongly associated with O. cf. ovata over the algal growth. The Rhodobacteraceae members encompassed phylotypes with an assessed mutualistic-pathogenic bimodal behavior. Fabibacter (0.7%-25.2%), Labrenzia (5.6%-24.3%), and Dietzia (0.04%-1.7%) were relevant at the stationary phase. Overall, the successional pattern and the metabolic and functional traits of the bacterial community retrieved in culture mirror those ones underpinning 0. cf. ovata bloom dynamics in field. Viral abundances increased synoptically with bacterial abundances during the first bacterial exponential growth step while being stationary during the second step. Microbial trends also suggest that viruses induced some shifts in bacterial community composition.

AB Fishes faced with novel thermal conditions often modify physiological functioning to compensate for elevated temperatures. This physiological plasticity (thermal acclimation) has been shown to improve metabolic performance and extend thermal limits in many species. Adjustments in cardiorespiratory function are often invoked as mechanisms underlying thermal plasticity because limitations in oxygen supply have been predicted to define thermal optima in fishes; however, few studies have explicitly linked cardiorespiratory plasticity to metabolic compensation. Here, we quantified thermal acclimation capacity in the commercially harvested Nile perch (Lates niloticus) of East Africa, and investigated mechanisms underlying observed changes. We reared juvenile Nile perch for 3 months under two temperature regimes, and then measured a series of metabolic traits (e.g. aerobic scope) and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) upon acute exposure to a range of experimental temperatures. We also measured morphological traits of heart ventricles, gills and brains to identify potential mechanisms for compensation. We found that long-term (3 month) exposure to elevated temperature induced compensation in upper thermal tolerance (CTmax) and metabolic performance (standard and maximum metabolic rate, and aerobic scope), and induced cardiac remodeling in Nile perch. Furthermore, variation in heart morphology influenced variations in metabolic function and thermal tolerance. These results indicate that plastic changes enacted over longer exposures lead to differences in metabolic flexibility when organisms are acutely exposed to temperature variation. Furthermore, we established functional links between cardiac plasticity, metabolic performance and thermal tolerance, providing evidence that plasticity in cardiac capacity may be one mechanism for coping with climate change.

AB Understanding the physical and biological mechanisms contributing to flow velocity-ecology relationships is crucial for successful river management. The application of an ecological traits-based approach offers the potential to explore mechanistic linkages between aquatic communities and a hydrological gradient. To date, however, studies focused on identifying these relationships have been limited by a lack of large-scale, long-term biological data. To address this gap at a scale relevant for water policy management, we employed data from a large-scale standardised benthic monitoring programthe Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Networkobtained from wadeable river sites across Canada. We applied the Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis method to quantify the response of the macroinvertebrate community, expressed as traditional taxonomic information and also as ecological traits, along a flow velocity gradient in reference and potential reference sites. Five key findings emerged: (1) using taxa and trait modalities revealed different flow velocity thresholds, (2) trait flow velocity indicators were less variable than taxon indicators, especially for positively responding trait modalities, (3) labile and non-labile trait modalities demonstrated highly similar patterns along the flow velocity gradient, (4) taxa from 12 different orders responded negatively to flow velocity, while only EPT taxa and some dipterans responded positively to flow velocity, and (5) traits related to mobility and ecology (e.g. climber and swimmer habits, preference of cold-cool eurythermal water and ability to survive desiccation) tended to respond positively to flow velocity, while traits related to morphology, life history and ecology (e.g. sprawler and burrower habits, preference for warm eurythermal water and inability to survive desiccation) tended to respond negatively to flow velocity. Providing ecologically based flow management targets can improve management plans, anticipate ecosystem consequences of anthropogenic change and support the development of policies to mitigate anthropogenic flow alteration. While our taxon and trait modality flow indicators were developed for Canadian watersheds, our methods to develop flow indicators and thresholds are transferrable to other systems where long-term biomonitoring programs are being developed, underscoring the need for long-term biomonitoring programs to support better ecosystem management.

AB Defining stream reference conditions is integral to providing benchmarks to ecological perturbation. We quantified channel geometry, hydrologic and environmental variables, and macroinvertebrates in 62 low-gradient, SE United States (U.S.) Sand Hills (Level IV ecoregion) sand-bed streams. To identify hydrogeomorphic reference condition (HGM), we clustered channel geometry deviation from expectations given watershed area (Aws), resulting in two HGM groups discriminated by area at the top of bank (Atob) residuals <0.6m(2) and >0.6m(2) predicted to be HGM reference/nonreference streams, respectively. Two independent partial least squares discriminate analyses used (1) hydrologic/environmental variables and (2) macroinvertebrate mean trait values (mT) on 10 reference/nonreference stream pairs of similar Aws for classification validation. Nonreference streams had flashier hydrographs and altered flow magnitudes, lower organic matter, coarser substrate, higher pH/specific conductivity compared with reference streams. Macroinvertebrate assemblages corresponded to HGM groupings, with mT indicative of multivoltinism, collector-gatherer functional feeding groups, fast current-preference taxa, and lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera richness and biotic integrity in nonreference streams. HGM classifications in Sand Hills, sand-bed streams were determined from channel geometry. This easily implemented classification is indicative of contemporary hydrologic disturbance resulting in contrasting macroinvertebrate assemblages.

AB Defining sustainability goals is a crucial but difficult task because it often involves the quantification of multiple interrelated and sometimes conflicting components. This complexity may be exacerbated by climate change, which will increase environmental vulnerability in aquaculture and potentially compromise the ability to meet the needs of a growing human population. Here, we developed an approach to inform sustainable aquaculture by quantifying spatio-temporal shifts in critical trade-offs between environmental costs and benefits using the time to reach the commercial size as a possible proxy of economic implications of aquaculture under climate change. Our results indicate that optimizing aquaculture practices by minimizing impact (this study considers as impact a benthic carbon deposition >= 1g Cm-2 day(-1)) will become increasingly difficult under climate change. Moreover, an increasing temperature will produce a poleward shift in sustainability trade-offs. These findings suggest that future sustainable management strategies and plans will need to account for the effects of climate change across scales. Overall, our results highlight the importance of integrating environmental factors in order to sustainably manage critical natural resources under shifting climatic conditions.

AB Novel flow regimes resulting from dam operations and overallocation of freshwater resources are an emerging consequence of global change. Yet, anticipating how freshwater biodiversity will respond to surging flow regime alteration requires overcoming two challenges in environmental flow science: shifting from local to riverscape-level understanding of biodiversity dynamics, and from static to time-varying characterizations of the flow regime. Here, we used time-series methods (wavelets and multivariate autoregressive models) to quantify flow-regime alteration and to link time-varying flow regimes to the dynamics of multiple local communities potentially connected by dispersal (i.e., a metacommunity). We studied the Chattahoochee River below Buford dam (Georgia, U.S.A.), and asked how flow regime alteration by a large hydropower dam may control the long-term functional trajectory of the downstream invertebrate metacommunity. We found that seasonal variation in hydropeaking synchronized temporal fluctuations in trait abundance among the flow-altered sites. Three biological trait states describing adaptation to fast flows benefitted from flow management for hydropower, but did not compensate for declines in 16 loser traits. Accordingly, metacommunity-wide functional diversity responded negatively to hydropeaking intensity, and stochastic simulations showed that the risk of functional diversity collapse within the next 4years would decrease by 17% if hydropeaking was ameliorated, or by 9% if it was applied every other season. Finally, an analysis of 97 reference and 23 dam-affected river sites across the U.S. Southeast suggested that flow variation at extraneous, human-relevant scales (12-hr, 24-hr, 1-week) is relatively common in rivers affected by hydropower dams. This study advances the notion that novel flow regimes are widespread, and simplify the functional structure of riverine communities by filtering out taxa with nonadaptive traits and by spatially synchronizing their dynamics. This is relevant in the light of ongoing and future hydrologic alteration due to climate non-stationarity and the new wave of dams planned globally.

AB Aim: We sought to identify direct and indirect effects of factors contributing to establishment and spread of 272 stream fish species.
   Location: Two hundred and ninety-seven watersheds in the eastern United States.
   Methods: We modelled two variables: (1) whether a species had become established outside its native range (establishment) and (2) the number of watersheds in which species established outside their native range (spread). We estimated these variables by comparing historical distributions to a rich data set of contemporary sampling. We calculated metrics of human use (indexing propagule pressure), and gathered species trait data from an open-access database. We then used piecewise path analysis to estimate direct and indirect effects of human use, native range size and species traits on the two metrics of species introductions.
   Results: We identified a hierarchical causal structure in which native range size and fishing pressure were important direct determinants of introductions. Species traits had some direct effects, but played a more indirect role. Native range size was significantly affected by thermal tolerance and diet breadth. Likewise, fishing pressure was significantly affected by life history strategy: larger-bodied, longer-living and more fecund species were positively associated with fishing pressure.
   Main conclusions: Functional traits can confer an advantage to some species during the establishment phase, but human use is important for subsequent dispersal throughout the non-native range. However, human use is non-random, and is largely a function of species traits. Considering both direct and indirect effects of traits across stages of the invasion process can help to elucidate the full role of traits in species invasions.

AB Deforestation is a primary driver of biodiversity change through habitat loss and fragmentation. Stream biodiversity may not respond to deforestation in a simple linear relationship. Rather, threshold responses to extent and timing of deforestation may occur. Identification of critical deforestation thresholds is needed for effective conservation and management. We tested for threshold responses of fish species and functional groups to degree of watershed and riparian zone deforestation and time since impact in 75 streams in the western Brazilian Amazon. We used remote sensing to assess deforestation from 1984 to 2011. Fish assemblages were sampled with seines and dip nets in a standardized manner. Fish species (n = 84) were classified into 20 functional groups based on ecomorphological traits associated with habitat use, feeding, and locomotion. Threshold responses were quantified using threshold indicator taxa analysis. Negative threshold responses to deforestation were common and consistently occurred at very low levels of deforestation (<20%) and soon after impact (<10 years). Sensitive species were functionally unique and associated with complex habitats and structures of allochthonous origin found in forested watersheds. Positive threshold responses of species were less common and generally occurred at >70% deforestation and >10 years after impact. Findings were similar at the community level for both taxonomic and functional analyses. Because most negative threshold responses occurred at low levels of deforestation and soon after impact, even minimal change is expected to negatively affect biodiversity. Delayed positive threshold responses to extreme deforestation by a few species do not offset the loss of sensitive taxa and likely contribute to biotic homogenization.

AB More than 80% of animals have complex life cycles and undergo distinct changes in ecology and morphology during development. The strength and type of factors regulating each life-stage may differ as an organism may occupy different niches during ontogeny. We examined the functional distance at larval and adult life-stages of two non-native anurans (Green Tree Frog [Hyla cinerea] and Bullfrog [Lithobates catesbeianus]) that have established in a Chihuahuan Desert anuran assemblage in Big Bend National Park. Both life stages of both non-native species occupied niche space outside of the native assemblage. At the larval stage, the ability of the tadpoles to utilize permanent aquatic habitats and coexist with predatory fishes differentiated the non-native species from the majority of the native species that are restricted to temporary pools. At the post-metamorphic life stage, each species appears to have established by exploiting unoccupied habitat and trophic niches in the recipient community. The arboreal habits of H. cinerea may enable it to utilize resources in microhabitats that are otherwise not used by native species because arboreal frogs are absent from this native assemblage. The large body size of post-metamorphic L. catesbeianus may enable it to utilize larger food resources that are otherwise unavailable to the smaller-bodied natives. Separate comparison of larval and adult functional traits between non-natives and the native community may help predict their potential establishment or invasion success as well as aid in the development of stage-specific control or eradication efforts.

AB Two Ponto-Caspian amphipods, Dikerogammarus villosus and Dikerogammarus haemobaphes, have expanded their geographical ranges from eastern Europe into Great Britain in recent years. This study represents one of the first examining the distribution and habitat preferences of coexisting populations of D. haemobaphes and D. villosus via field and laboratory experiments in the UK. Field surveys of a recently invaded lowland reservoir in the UK are complimented with ex situ laboratory mesocosm experiments examining the substrate preferences of coexisting populations of D. villosus and D. haemobaphes. Results from the field study indicated that D. haemobaphes dominated the macroinvertebrate community within the reservoir and demonstrated a strong affinity for large cobble and artificial substrates. D. villosus occurred at lower abundances but displayed a strong preference for coarse cobble substrates. A third invasive amphipod, Crangonyx pseudogracilis, was largely confined to sand/silt habitats. Laboratory mesocosm experiments clearly supported the field observations of D. villosus and D. haemobaphes with both species demonstrating a preference for cobble substrates. Results from the study highlight the importance of characterising physical habitat when investigating biological invasions and suggest that habitat availability may influence the extent and speed at which range expansion of new amphipod invaders occurs.

AB Aquatic macroinvertebrates, 18 physical-chemical water characteristics and 30 hydromorphological variables were assessed at 85 locations on Leyte island, Philippines. Biological traits derived from literature were linked to the biological samples based on four different trait estimation methods. These data were used to determine the relation with river characteristics using negative binomial regression. At least five feeding habit modalities were associated with conductivity, velocity, pH, temperature, ammonium-N concentrations, and sediment. The various methods of estimating trait abundance differ in determined major patterns and ecological implications. Therefore, the estimation method used should be explicitly described in trait-related papers to avoid misinterpretation. Trait abundance-environment relationships can be linear or non-linear and therefore a careful selection of the functional relationship should be performed. The process of extracting knowledge from data is of paramount importance as relevant ecological insights were extracted providing insights on flow, wastewater and nutrient management in the rivers.

AB The occurrence of benthic diatoms in large river plankton is considered to be highly stochastic. Accordingly, the widely applied phytoplankton functional group concept sensu Reynolds (FG) classifies all benthic diatom taxa together. Based on data of a high-frequency 1-year long phytoplankton survey of the Pearl River (China), we tested whether the combination of the FG system with various trait-based classifications of benthic diatoms enhances our ability in predicting the community composition from the local environment. Using the Self-Organizing Map approach, we identified characteristic community compositions based on (i) taxonomic data, (ii) the FG approach, and (iii) the FG system combined with trait-based functional approaches of benthic diatoms: size structure, ecological guilds, and eco-morphological groups. All combined functional approaches enabled better predictions for the community composition than the taxonomic data or the FG system alone. The most reliable approach was the combination of the FG system with ecological guilds of benthic diatoms. Therefore, the occurrence of benthic diatoms in large river phytoplankton can be assessed ecologically in a meaningful way based on combined planktic and benthic functional classifications. The application of this approach seems to be highly relevant in large river phytoplankton ecology, ecological modelling, or in ecological status indication.

AB Waterbirds have a major functional role in wetlands, and understanding how functional traits of waterbirds depend on environmental characteristics can facilitate management of ecosystems and their services. We investigate how the waterbird community in a Neotropical river-floodplain system responds to environmental gradients, identifying how they affect waterbird species richness, functional diversity (measured as functional dispersion) and functional composition (specific functional traits). We sampled 22 lakes in the Upper Parana floodplain system in southern Brazil, and modelled avian functional diversity and species richness as a function of environmental variables. Then we used a unified RLQ and fourth-corner analysis to evaluate environment-trait relationships. Waterbird species richness and functional diversity varied according to different environmental variables. Lake area and diversity of aquatic vegetation were associated with avian species richness, while relative abundance of grass and emergent macrophytes and mean and variation of depth were related to functional diversity. Furthermore, changes in functional diversity seemed to be mainly driven by presence of species that depend on perches for foraging (e.g. kingfishers, cormorants, and kites), whose presence was mainly associated with deep water and emergent macrophytes. Nevertheless, changes in functional diversity and functional composition did not depend on exactly the same set of environmental variables, suggesting that trait combinations (e.g. below surface feeders who feed on fish), not only specific traits, are important drivers of the variation in functional diversity between lakes. Given the observed differences in responses of species richness and functional diversity, both these diversity metrics should be used as complementary tools in ecosystem management. Furthermore, our results show that functional diversity and composition are partially coupled, suggesting that although functional diversity is influenced by the environmental filtering of particular traits, it also reflects other ecological mechanisms (e.g. competitive interactions among species).

AB Although the influence of microbial community assembly processes on aquatic ecosystem function and biodiversity is well known, the processes that govern planktonic communities in human-impacted rivers remain largely unstudied. Here, we used multivariate statistics and a null model approach to test the hypothesis that environmental conditions and obstructed dispersal opportunities, dictate a deterministic community assembly for phytoplankton and bacterioplankton across contrasting hydrographic conditions in a subtropical mid-sized river (Jiulong River, southeast China). Variation partitioning analysis showed that the explanatory power of local environmental variables was larger than that of the spatial variables for both plankton communities during the dry season. During the wet season, phytoplankton community variation was mainly explained by local environmental variables, whereas the variance in bacterioplankton was explained by both environmental and spatial predictors. The null model based on Raup-Crick coefficients for both planktonic groups suggested little evidences of the stochastic processes involving dispersal and random distribution. Our results showed that hydrological change and landscape structure act together to cause divergence in communities along the river channel, thereby dictating a deterministic assembly and that selection exceeds dispersal limitation during the dry season. Therefore, to protect the ecological integrity of human-impacted rivers, watershed managers should not only consider local environmental conditions but also dispersal routes to account for the effect of regional species pool on local communities.

AB There is little understanding of the variability in the structure and function of metazoan hyporheic communities across streams draining geologies that weather to produce different pore sizes and, by extension, different hydrological conditions. In this study we selected two catchments in each of three geologies that had differing values of hydraulic conductivity and porosity, and sampled four riffles in each catchment at high and low water levels and at two depths. We found clear differences in the physical template of streams draining different geologies and in the composition and abundance of communities inhabiting the hyporheic zones of streams draining chalk/sandstone and limestone geologies. However, we did not detect any significant differences in body size, biomass or functional measures (diversity, richness, redundancy) between the geologies. Our findings imply that ecosystem functioning in streams draining geologies that produce fine grain sediments may be similar to those draining geologies that produce coarse grained sediments irrespective of differences in the physical template and community structure.

AB Effective conservation of ecosystems requires deep knowledge concerning multiple aspects of biodiversity including alpha and beta components of species richness, taxonomic, and functional diversity, as well as their relationships. The taxonomic and functional alpha-diversity positively correlated to species richness and functional evolution exceeded taxonomic differentiation. We divided the Yangtze whole basin into 56 units, and then the information on fish composition and their distribution in each unit was revised. Results showed that the fish diversity was strongly driven by variation in the species turnover between watersheds with the geological environmental heterogeneity, while the TD and FD variation could be attributed to species nestedness, as taxonomic category or functional trait of species in one unit was a subset of that in other units. The high beta-diversity in SR was mostly composed of high turnover, while the high beta-diversity of TD and FD resulted from high nestedness. Species functional differentiation was faster than taxonomic differentiation during the process of adoption to environment variation. An integrated index of multifaceted diversity considering the high species richness and important functional role suggested the headwater with abundant endemic species, the middle mainstream necessary to fish migration, and the lakes containing higher diverse species were primarily recommended for conservation.

AB Vegetation mapping is a legal obligation in environmental monitoring prompting the need for easy-to-read methods of quantifying changes in vegetation dynamics. Transition matrix modelling provides an alternative approach to qualitative assessment promoting quantification for revealing current complex changes effects on the trajectory of ecosystems. Transition matrix models (TMMs) and two newly developed metrics, the pixel change (PCI) and zonal change (ZCI) indices, were combined into a methodological scheme that provides a multiscale assessment protocol. This protocol was applied during a field study along the Old Rhine River in order to assess complex shifts in alluvial vegetation communities in relation to restoration works and natural processes. The restoration works aim to restore lateral mobility through instream flow increase and controlled bank erosion with artificial groynes implementation. Characterisation of spatial and temporal pathways was carried out using a 'before-after control-impact' (BACI) design, and a fuzzy coding approach has shed further light on shifts in aquatic vegetation functional traits. The multiscale assessment protocol highlighted (i) an increase in alluvial habitat types, including habitats of European concern (Natura 2000), and (ii) low time-scale aquatic vegetation recovery. Both ZCI and PCI recorded high values along the restored section with controlled bank erosion, indicating strong ecosystem change. Use of functional traits detected three requirements for the successful establishment of aquatic vegetation in the restored river section, i.e. high degree of flexibility, flow variation tolerance, and fine-sediment adaptability. Subject to the reliability and availability of vegetation mapping, the method opens the possibility of an efficient tool for precisely monitoring alluvial vegetation communities and identifying pathways. It also discriminates event effects, e.g. natural process effects vs. human-induced effects. At full potential, such a protocol may reveal community responses to disturbance during conservation, restoration and management decision-making projects.

AB Even though the Red Sea is characterized by unique oceanographic conditions, only few studies have addressed the ecology of its deep-sea benthos. This work discusses some traits of the Saudi deep waters of the Red Sea between 23 degrees N and 28 degrees N. Macrobenthic samples were collected using a box corer (0.1 m(2) surface area) from 59 stations at depths ranging between 220 m and 1678 m. The stations were categorized into four depth zones (<= 500 m, 501-750 m, 751-1000 m and > 1000 m) and two latitudinal areas (northern and central) for data analysis. A total of 186 species have been identified including polychaetes (135), crustaceans (27), molluscs (18), echinoderms (3), echiuroid (1), sipunculoid (1), and oligochaete (1). While 114 species were present in only 1-3 stations, only 30 species were found to be widely distributed, being recorded in all depth zones from northern and central areas. The trophic structure analysis indicated high functional diversity with the presence of seven feeding levels represented mainly by surface deposit feeders, facultative detritivores, and benthic carnivores. In general, the density and biomass of the deep sea macrobenthic community studied herein are lower than those reported in other seas with similar depth zones. This is most likely due to the particular environmental factors of the Red Sea, represented mainly by its oligotrophic nature, high temperature, high salinity, and low food availability in the form of organic matter. It is worth noting that some ecological parameters considered showed a general decreasing pattern (density: 10-1666 ind. m(-2); biomass: 0.02-10.98 gm(-2); species richness S: 1-59; Shannon-Wiener diversity index H': 0 - 5.1) in relation with the increasing depth in northern and central areas. The bathymetric trends of the macrobenthic communities were also demonstrated with findings of multivariate analyses. The distribution of benthic communities at all depth zones appeared to be controlled by the availability of organic matter and abiotic factors such as temperature and salinity. Pronounced latitudinal and longitudinal trends in the macrobenthic communities are not evident, most likely due to the limited latitudinal and longitudinal variation of the sampling stations of this study. No spatial variations were found with the feeding types, species evenness index, and species dominance index. Considering the scarcity of published data on the deep benthic community from the Red Sea, this study provides some useful baseline information on this topic and contributes to decrease the knowledge gap on the diversity of macrobenthic communities in this region.

AB Aim1. To disentangle the effects of local environmental conditions and space at multiple scales in order to uncover and explain biogeographical signals in microbial communities of freshwater diatoms. 2. To assess the role of species traits related to dispersal capacities in diatom biogeography.
   Location Rivers and streams of Sweden sampled over a total area of 450,000km(2).
   MethodsWe used partial redundancy analyses and variation partitioning coupled with spatial eigenfunctions analyses to separate the effects of environment and space at three different scales on diatoms community structure. As community analyses might give limited insight into species-specific mechanisms, we also performed species by species variation partitioning and the amount of variance explained by each fraction was related to species cell length and attachment to the substrate.
   Results We found a strong effect of environment and space at a large scale suggesting environmental filtering and dispersal limitation over large distances. Additionally, species-based analyses uncovered an effect of space at fine scale suggesting possible species-specific mass effect dynamic or species sorting driven by missing environmental factors varying at fine scale. Environmental and spatial effects varied strongly among species, but this variation was not explained by cell length and attachment to the substrate.
   Main conclusions Our results confirm the importance of both environment and dispersal-related processes in controlling diatom community structure and bring new perspectives on the role of dispersal in shaping microbial communities at biogeographical scale. Dispersal being a species-specific mechanism, species associations are not necessarily conserved from site to site and species-based approaches can detect different spatial patterns than those derived from traditional community analyses. Contrary to the conclusions of small-scale analysis of connected metacommunities, interspecific trait variation seems to be of limited importance for long-distance overland dispersal in diatoms.

   MANAGEMENT
AB There is growing recognition of the essential services provided to humanity by functionally intact ecosystems. Freshwater ecosystems are found throughout agricultural and urban landscapes and provide a wide range of ecosystem services, but globally they are also amongst the most vulnerable. In particular, ponds (lentic waters typically less than 2ha), provide natural flood management, sequester carbon and hold significant cultural value. However, to inform their management it is important to understand (1) how functional diversity varies in response to disturbance and (2) the link between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function. In this study, a meta-analysis of seven separate pond studies from across England and Wales was carried out to explore the effect of urban and agricultural land-use gradients, shading, emergent vegetation, surface area and pH upon groups of functionally similar members of the macroinvertebrate fauna. Functional effect groups were first identified by carrying out a hierarchical cluster analysis using body size, voltinism and feeding habits (18 categories) that are closely related to biogeochemical processes (e.g. nutrient and carbon recycling). Secondly, the influence of the gradients upon effect group membership (functional redundancyFR) and the breadth of traits available to aid ecosystem recovery (response diversity) was assessed using species counts and functional dispersion (FDis) using 12 response traits. The effect of land-use gradients was unpredictable, whilst there was a negative response in both FR and FDis to shading and positive responses to increases in emergent vegetation cover and surface area. An inconsistent association between FDis and FR suggested that arguments for taxonomic biodiversity conservation to augment ecosystem functioning are too simplistic. Thus, a deeper understanding of the response of functional diversity to disturbance could have greater impact with decision-makers who may relate better to the loss of ecosystem function in response to environmental degradation than species loss alone.

AB Aquatic ecosystems are facing escalating threats from urbanization, habitat loss and projected impacts of climate change, which both individually and in combination have the potential to fundamentally alter ecosystem functioning. While it is well established that habitat disturbances can affect the composition and diversity of aquatic communities, only recently have studies considered whether such impacts result in changes in species' functional traits. We consider how functional traits of freshwater and marine fishes respond to environmental change, and how shifts in the expression of these traits can impact community dynamics and key ecological processes, including trophic interactions and nutrient transfer. We find that a multitude of functional traits, including behavioural and sensory traits, is sensitive to habitat disturbances. We demonstrate how these trait changes can be used to reveal hidden ecological diversity as well as serving as early indicators of environmental perturbation. We conclude that management strategies that consider the fundamental biological responses of fishes to habitat disturbance will be particularly effective in determining causal relationships within the ecological network. While detailed information on trait function is often lacking, even some general understanding of trait function and importance will facilitate targeted and efficient ecosystem management. We urge fisheries biologists and aquatic ecosystem managers to consider the role of functional traits in facilitating effective habitat restoration and management.

AB Body size, coupled with abundance and taxonomy, may help to understand the mechanisms shaping community structure. Since the body size of fish is closely related to their trophic niche, size diversity (based on individual body size) of fish communities may capture intraspecific variations in fish trophic niches that are not detected by species diversity. Thus, the relationship between size diversity and species diversity may help to integrate variation at both intraspecific and interspecific levels. We studied the relationship between species diversity and size diversity as a measure of the degree of overlap in size among species and thereby the potential overlap in niches in a community. We hypothesized that the relationship between size diversity and species would be different across the European continent due to different levels of size overlap in fish communities. The data were derived from samplings of fish communities using standardised benthic gill nets in 363 lakes. At the continental scale, size diversity increased with species diversity; at the ecoregion scale, the slope of the relation changed across the continent, with the greatest mismatch occurring in northern Europe where communities comprised only one or a few species, but each of which exhibited a great range in size. There was an increase in slope towards the south with significant relations for four out of six ecoregions. The steeper size diversity-species diversity slope at lower latitudes is attributable to a lower overlap in fish size and thus likely to finer niche separation. Our results also suggest that size diversity is not a strong surrogate for species diversity in European lake fish communities. Thus, particularly in fish communities composed of few species, measuring size diversity may help to detect potential functional variation which may be neglected by measuring species diversity alone.

AB Bottom fishing such as trawling and dredging may pose serious risks to the seabed and benthic habitats, calling for a quantitative assessment method to evaluate the impact and guide management to develop mitigation measures. We provide a method to estimate the sensitivity of benthic habitats based on the longevity composition of the invertebrate community. We hypothesize that long-lived species are more sensitive to trawling mortality due to their lower pace of life (i.e., slower growth, late maturation). We analyze data from box-core and grab samples taken from 401 stations in the English Channel and southern North Sea to estimate the habitat-specific longevity composition of the benthic invertebrate community and of specific functional groups (i.e., suspension feeders and bioturbators), and examine how bottom trawling affects the longevity biomass composition. The longevity biomass composition differed between habitats governed by differences in sediment composition (gravel and mud content) and tidal bed-shear stress. The biomass proportion of long-lived species increased with gravel content and decreased with mud content and shear stress. Bioturbators had a higher median longevity than suspension feeders. Trawling, in particular by gears that penetrate the seabed >2 cm, shifted the community toward shorter-lived species. Changes from bottom trawling were highest in habitats with many long-lived species (hence increasing with gravel content, decreasing with mud content). Benthic communities in high shear stress habitats were less affected by bottom trawling. Using these relationships, we predicted the sensitivity of the benthic community from bottom trawling impact at large spatial scale (the North Sea). We derived different benthic sensitivity metrics that provide a basis to estimate indicators of trawling impact on a continuous scale for the total community and specific functional groups. In combination with high resolution data of trawling pressure, our approach can be used to monitor and assess trawling impact and seabed status at the scale of the region or broadscale habitat and to compare the environmental impact of bottom-contacting fishing gears across fisheries.

AB Ecologists have long studied primary succession, the changes that occur in biological communities after initial colonization of an environment. Most of this work has focused on succession in plant communities, laying the conceptual foundation for much of what we currently know about community assembly patterns over time. Because of their prevalence and importance in ecosystems, an increasing number of studies have focused on microbial community dynamics during succession. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of bacterial primary succession patterns across a range of distinct habitats, including the infant gut, plant surfaces, soil chronosequences, and aquatic environments, to determine whether consistent changes in bacterial diversity, community composition, and functional traits are evident over the course of succession. Although these distinct habitats harbor unique bacterial communities, we were able to identify patterns in community assembly that were shared across habitat types. We found an increase in taxonomic and functional diversity with time while the taxonomic composition and functional profiles of communities became less variable (lower beta diversity) in late successional stages. In addition, we found consistent decreases in the rRNA operon copy number and in the high-efficient phosphate assimilation process (Pst system) suggesting that reductions in resource availability during succession select for taxa adapted to low-resource conditions. Together, these results highlight that, like many plant communities, microbial communities also exhibit predictable patterns during primary succession.

AB BACKGROUND: Aquatic exercise programs are used in rehabilitation and might help to reduce disability after stroke. This was a randomized intervention trial to assess the influence of an aquatic exercise program on people suffering from depression and anxiety after ischemic stroke.
   METHODS: Participants were randomized to an experimental group (EG) composed of 19 individuals (51.8 +/- 8.5 years; ten males and nine females), and a control group (CG) composed of 17 people (52.7 +/- 6.7 years; nine males and eight females). The aquatic exercise program consisted of two sessions per week, each lasting between 45 and 60 minutes and divided into 5 to 10 minutes exercise sections during 12 weeks. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to determine anxiety levels while the Beck Depression Inventory was used as a self-assessment of depression.
   RESULTS: EG improved measures of depression, anxiety trait and anxiety state between pre- and post-treatment, with no changes in CG. EG improved in all tests related to functional capacity compared to CG.
   CONCLUSIONS: The practice of aquatic exercises promotes improvements in the levels of depression and anxiety in people who suffered an ischemic stroke.

AB Protists are among the most diverse and abundant eukaryotes in soil. However, gaps between described and sequenced protist morphospecies still present a pending problem when surveying environmental samples for known species using molecular methods. The number of sequences in the molecular PR2 database (similar to 130,000) is limited compared to the species richness expected (>1 million protist species) limiting the recovery rate. This is important, since high throughput sequencing (HTS) methods are used to find associative patterns between functional traits, taxa and environmental parameters. We performed HTS to survey soil flagellates in 150 grasslands of central Europe, and tested the recovery rate of ten previously isolated and cultivated cercomonad species, among locally found diversity. We recovered sequences for reference soil flagellate species, but also a great number of their phylogenetically evaluated genetic variants, among rare and dominant taxa with presumably own biogeography. This was recorded among dominant (cercozoans, Sandona), rare (apusozoans) and a large hidden diversity of predominantly aquatic protists in soil (choanoflagellates, bicosoecids) often forming novel clades associated with uncultured environmental sequences. Evaluating the reads, instead of the OTUs that individual reads are usually clustered into, we discovered that much of this hidden diversity may be lost due to clustering. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Warming due to climate change is expected to alter species interactions. These interactions are shaped by components of individual behavior, particularly foraging behaviors. However, few studies consider species' behavioral responses to warming to predict how species interactions will be affected by warming. We chose two complementary approaches to examine how climate warming may affect the behavior and interactions of aquatic intraguild predators. First, we measured behavioral responses to warming in six larval dragonfly species, expecting that feeding rate and activity would increase with temperature. Secondly, we conducted intraguild predation (IGP) trials with three species to understand how temperature affects IGP, and if species' behavioral responses to warming are indicative of the outcome of IGP interactions. Warming increased feeding rates by 42% on average across species but had no effect on activity rate. The magnitude of change in feeding rate was positively correlated with the maximum temperatures species experience across their ranges. Lastly, warming increased rates of IGP twofold, however, species' behavioral responses alone were not predictive of their susceptibility to become IG prey of other larvae at warmer temperatures. Our results provide evidence that IGP interactions may be greatly affected by future increases in temperature; however, activity responses to warming alone are weak predictors of the outcomes of these interactions. Future studies should consider other species' traits when forecasting the effects of climate change on species interactions.

AB Variation in resource use among species determines their potential for competition and co-existence, as well as their impact on ecosystem processes. Planktonic crustaceans consume a range of micro-organisms that vary among habitats and species, but these differences in resource consumption are difficult to characterize due to the small size of the organisms. Consumers acquire amino acids from their diet, and the composition of tissues reflects both the use of different resources and their assimilation in proteins. We examined the amino acid composition of common crustacean zooplankton from 14 tropical lakes in Colombia in three regions (the Amazon floodplain, the eastern range of the Andes, and the Caribbean coast). Amino acid composition varied significantly among taxonomic groups and the three regions. Functional richness in amino acid space was greatest in the Amazon, the most productive region, and tended to be positively related to lake trophic status, suggesting the niche breadth of the community could increase with ecosystem productivity. Functional evenness increased with lake trophic status, indicating that species were more regularly distributed within community-wide niche space in more productive lakes. These results show that zooplankton resource use in tropical lakes varies with both habitat and taxonomy, and that lake productivity may affect community functional diversity and the distribution of species within niche space.

AB Aim: Studies of species' range shifts have become increasingly relevant for understanding ecology and biogeography in the face of accelerated global change. The combination of limited mobility and imperilled status places some species at a potentially greater risk of range loss, extirpation or extinction due to climate change. To assess the ability of organisms with limited movement and dispersal capabilities to track shifts associated with climate change, we evaluated reproductive and dispersal traits of freshwater mussels (Unionida), sessile invertebrates that require species-specific fish for larval dispersal.
   Location: North American Atlantic Slope rivers.
   Methods: To understand how unionid mussels may cope with and adapt to current and future warming trends, we identified mechanisms that facilitated their colonization of the northern Atlantic Slope river basins in North America after the Last Glacial Maximum. We compiled species occurrence and life history trait information for each of 55 species, and then selected life history traits for which ample data were available (larval brooding duration, host fish specificity, host infection strategy, and body size) and analysed whether the trait state for each was related to mussel distribution in Atlantic Slope rivers.
   Results: Brooding duration (p < .01) and host fish specificity (p = .02) were significantly related to mussel species distribution. Long-term brooders were more likely than short-term brooders to colonize formerly glaciated rivers, as were host generalists compared to specialists. Body size and host infection strategy were not predictive of movement into formerly glaciated rivers (p > .10).
   Main conclusions: Our results are potentially applicable to many species for which life history traits have not been well-documented, because reproductive and dispersal traits in unionid mussels typically follow phylogenetic relationships. These findings may help resource managers prioritize species according to climate change vulnerability and predict which species might become further imperilled with climate warming. Finally, we suggest that similar trait-based decision support frameworks may be applicable for other movement limited taxa.

AB Aim: Urbanization broadly affects the phylogenetic and functional diversity of natural communities through a variety of processes including habitat loss and the introduction of non-native species. Due to the challenge of acquiring direct measurements, these effects have been studied primarily using space-for-time substitution where spatial urbanization gradients are used to infer the consequences of urbanization occurring across time. The ability of alternative sampling designs to replicate the findings derived using space-for-time substitution has not been tested.
   Location: Global.
   Methods: We contrasted the phylogenetic and functional diversity of breeding bird assemblages in 58 cities worldwide with the corresponding regional breeding bird assemblages estimated using geographic range maps.
   Results: Compared to regional assemblages, urban assemblages contained lower phylogenetic diversity, lower phylogenetic beta diversity, a reduction in the least evolutionary distinct species and the loss of the most evolutionarily distinct species. We found no evidence that these effects were related to the presence of non-native species. Urban assemblages contained fewer aquatic species and fewer aquatic foraging species. The distribution of body size and range size narrowed for urban assemblages with the loss of species at both tails of the distribution, especially large bodied and broadly distributed species. Urban assemblages contained a greater proportion of species classified as passerines, doves or pigeons; species identified as granivores; species that forage within vegetation or in the air; and species with more generalized associations with foraging strata.
   Main conclusions: Urbanization is associated with the overall reduction and constriction of phylogenetic and functional diversity, results that largely replicate those generated using space-for-time substitution, increasing our confidence in the quality of the combined inferences. When direct measurements are unavailable, our findings emphasize the value of developing independent sampling methods that broaden and reinforce our understanding of the ecological implications of urbanization.

AB Our understandings on the patterns and mechanisms of plant community assembly during succession, especially the primary succession in glacier retreat areas, remain limited. The Hailuogou Glacier Chronosequence provides a distinctive place to disentangle the biotic interactions and abiotic filtering effects on community successional trajectories.
   Through community-weighted approaches, we quantified elements allocation and regulation in leaves and roots, N:P stoichiometry, and the biotic and abiotic controls guiding community dynamics along the 120-year chronosequence.
   Across seven primary successional stages, plant leaves featured higher concentrations of macro-elements with lower coefficients of variation (CV) with increasing succession; whereas, fine roots contained more micro-elements with higher CV. From the early to late stages, foliar N:P increased linearly from 8.2 to 20.1.
   These findings highlighted that the limiting factor for plant growth shifted from N to P over one century of deglaciation. Edaphic factors (pH, bulk density, N and P concentrations) acted as deterministic filtering for trait convergence in the early stages, while biotic factors (species richness and plant litter biomass) for competitive exclusion dominated the late stages hosting species with stronger homoeostatic regulation and more conservative nutrient use.

AB Biodiversity studies commonly focus on taxonomic diversity measures such as species richness and abundance. However, alternative measures based on ecomorphological traits are also critical for unveiling the processes shaping biodiversity and community assembly along environmental gradients. Our study presents the first analysis of habitat-trait-community structure in a Balkan biodiversity hotspot (Louros river, NW Greece), through the investigation of the relationships among freshwater fish assemblages' composition, morphological traits and habitat features. In order to provide a hierarchical classification of species' priority to protection measures, we highlight the most ecomorphologically distinct species using originality analysis. Our results suggest that the longitudinal changes of habitat variables (water temperature, depth, substrate, altitude) drive the local fish assemblages' structure highlighting the upstream-downstream gradient. We also present evidence for environmental filtering, establishing fish assemblages according to their ecomorphological traits. The calculation of the seven available indices of ecomorphological originality indicates that Valencia letourneuxi and Cobitis hellenica, which are endemic to Louros and threatened with extinction, exhibited the highest distinctiveness; thus their protection is of great importance. The methodological approach followed and the patterns described herein can contribute further to the application of community ecology theory to conservation, highlighting the need to use ecomorphological traits as a useful 'tool'.

AB Global warming is expected to cause significant changes in the distribution of species worldwide, altering ecosystem function and services. These impacts can be exacerbated by synergism with other global change drivers, such as biological invasions. Furcraea foetida (Asparagaceae) is a CAM species native to Central America and northern South America that is currently invading coastal ecosystems in the Atlantic Forest biome in Brazil. The species propagates clonally by bulbils, forming dense clusters that exclude native species. We addressed whether warming may favor or impair development of F. foetida bulbils based on functional traits and assessed whether plant cover of native species influenced F. foetida establishment in a rocky shore ecosystem. We used open-top chambers during summer and autumn, which increased air temperature during daylight hours by 0.4 A degrees C relative to ambient conditions. This short-term warming effect increased the leaf length of bulbils but had no effect on number of leaves, dry mass, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), or photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm). However, an increase in vegetation cover decreased LDMC and helped maintain high Fv/Fm, having an indirect positive effect on F. foetida establishment that suggests a facilitation interaction in this extreme environment. Even though the manipulated temperature did not reach IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) forecasts for 2100, our data show that even small, short-term changes in temperature affected plant performance. Thus, we suggest that F. foetida may be favored in a scenario of climate change, increasing its negative effects on biodiversity of coastal ecosystems.

AB In river-floodplain systems, the construction of dams causes environmental changes in the natural dynamics of rivers and the associated wetlands, which can affect both the taxonomic and functional composition of communities, and, consequently, ecosystem functioning. We evaluated zooplankton taxonomic and functional -diversity in sets of lakes associated with a preserved and a dammed river in a Neotropical floodplain. We expected that both -diversity measures would be lower in lakes associated with a dammed river than in lakes associated with a preserved river. -Diversity was partitioned into turnover and nestedness components, through multiple-site dissimilarity measures, and compared with expected null models. We expected that nestedness would be more important for both the -diversity measures in lakes associated with the dammed river, whereas species and trait turnover would be more important in lakes associated with the preserved river. Functional -diversity was higher among lakes of the preserved river than of the dammed river, while taxonomic -diversity was not different between the rivers. Contributions of turnover and nestedness components were similar in the preserved river, whereas that of nestedness was higher in the dammed river, revealing the loss of extreme trait combinations from the functional space. Comparisons between observed and expected -diversity revealed a higher trait turnover than would be expected by species turnover in the preserved river, and no differences from the null models were observed in lakes associated with the dammed river. Our results suggest that dissimilarity in trait composition is influenced more by environmental changes associated with river damming than by dissimilarity in species composition such that a functional homogenisation occurs without a change in taxonomic -diversity. We propose the maintenance of preserved tributaries in floodplains, which sustain environmental heterogeneity, primarily if the nearby environments are already dammed. Furthermore, we reinforce the necessity of a pluralistic approach, considering both taxonomic and functional aspects of biodiversity in ecosystem management.

AB Vegetated buffer strips constitute a transition zone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and provide several ecosystem services. Buffer strips are often applied as a mitigation measure against diffuse pollution in agricultural areas, primarily because they may retain nutrients and in this way help protect the aquatic environment. Additionally, they can improve biodiversity in an otherwise homogenous landscape and may therefore have a value in their own right. In the present study, we characterized the structural and functional features of the vegetation in Danish buffer strips using a nationwide dataset to explore: i) their floristic quality in terms of species diversity and conservation value and ii) based on their functional characteristics, their potential to retain nutrients. Moreover, we analyzed how the structural and functional characteristics varied along gradients in the environmental features of the catchment. We found that the floristic quality of the buffer vegetation was generally low, exhibiting an average of only 3.3% of the number of species of conservation interest. Instead, Danish buffer strips were dominated by widespread and productive species that are tolerant of anthropogenic impacts in the catchment. The abundance of highly productive plant species was positively related to high intensity land use, whereas the abundance of stress-tolerant plant species was positively related to low intensity land use. The high productivity of the buffer strips implies a large bio-storage potential, and these areas might therefore offer an opportunity to remove nutrients by harvesting the plant biomass. We discuss how Danish buffer strips could be exploited via appropriate management (e.g. harvesting) to maximize nutrient retention and at the same time improve floristic quality.

However, how the strength of these controls varies with UV radiation (UVR) is not well known. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the phosphorus (P) content of phytoplankton affects the role that UVR exerts strengthening or weakening the resource and consumer control on distinct stoichiometric and functional phytoplankton traits. To accomplish this, we coupled field meso- and microcosms in a split-plot design using UVR treatments at the plot level and nutrients and zooplankton (presence/absence) at the subplot level, in two mountain lakes characterized by their P-sufficient (La Caldera) and P-deficient phytoplankton (Los Cantaros). We found that the addition of nutrients decreased phytoplankton C:P in both lakes, but enhanced primary production and chlorophyll a only under UVR in La Caldera. Also, the effects of zooplankton on phytoplankton varied between lakes and UVR conditions, and increased primary production and chlorophyll a under UVR in La Caldera, but not in Los Cantaros. These results suggest that differences in the stoichiometric aspects associated with the P content in phytoplankton play a key role in how UVR affects resource and consumer controls, with much weaker effects in P-deficient food webs.

AB Herbivory can determine the rates of ecosystem functions and is key factor to periphytic algae development. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of herbivory of zooplankton and omnivorous fish in periphytic algae of lake ecosystems. Based on prediction of grazer:prey size ratio, we tested that periphytic algal biomass and density will be lower in the fish treatments. Based on prediction of the sizes-elective predation, size-efficiency hypothesis, and general allometric equations, and that both herbivores will feed with distinct mode, we tested the hypothesis that periphytic algal functional diversity will be higher in the mixed treatment. There were four treatments (Control, Ti -zooplankton, T2-fish, T3-zooplankton+-fish). We evaluated algae biomass, density, functional traits, functional diversity, and the herbivory effect. Our results show that the presence of both herbivores were related to higher functional diversity, lower density values, and prostrate periphytic algae, and in T2 occurs higher periphytic algae biomass via nutrient facilitation. Fish was responsible for the higher consumer effect size, and was more important modifier than zooplankton of the periphytic algae community. The greater variation in producer species traits was directly related to mixed foraging patterns of herbivores together, which allow rare species to persist, decreasing the dominance of stronger competitive species.

AB Little is known regarding consequences of climate change on riparian plant functional types (PFTs) related to leaf traits, with putative domino effects on stream food webs, plausible even if the tipping point of stream-desiccation is not reached. We hypothesized that, as stream food-webs are highly dependent on riparian subsidies, climate change might alter PFTs to the point of weakening terrestrial-aquatic linkages. We conducted a gradient analysis to assess the relative effects of climate, soil and riparian physical characteristics on PFTs. If PFTs differ significantly in leaf traits and climate had major influences on them, we could assume space-for-time interchangeability forward in time to predict leaf traits changes, and consequences for stream food webs under future climate change scenarios. Results indicated a clear distinction in leaf traits among PFTs: woody deciduous plants showed leaf traits associated to high decomposability and nutritional value for invertebrate shredders compared to evergreen woody and giant graminoid groups. We found a prime role of climate predicting changes in abundance and diversity of PFTs: 1) a warming and precipitation-decline scenario, coupled with soil characteristics related to aridification, would have detrimental effects on deciduous plants, while fostering giant graminoids; 2) in a scenario of no precipitation-reduction in wetter areas, warming might promote the expansion of evergreen to the detriment of deciduous plants. In both scenarios the net outcome implies increasing recalcitrance of leaf litter inputs, potentially weakening terrestrial-aquatic linkages in headwater streams.

AB Vegetated buffer strips are often established in agricultural landscapes as an "edge of the field" mitigation measure against diffuse nutrient pollution of the aquatic environment. Harvesting of the vegetation has been suggested as a possible management strategy to prevent build-up of excessive amounts of nutrients in buffer soils and, at the same time, harvesting can have a positive effect on the diversity of the vegetation. However, the response of the vegetation to harvesting likely depends on taxonomic and functional characteristics. In the present study, we explored effects of harvesting frequency (by comparing harvesting once, twice, and four times per year to an unharvested control) on the taxonomic and functional trait composition of four different types of plant communities in buffer strips in Denmark. We found that one to two harvests per year mediated an increase in the diversity of the vegetation in low diversity buffer strips dominated by tall and productive herbs (tall herb fringe), whereas the diversity remained unchanged in buffer strips dominated by grasses as well as in more diverse buffer strips with rich fen and wet meadow species. We also found that harvesting changed the compositional patterns in the tall herb fringe community, with an increasing abundance of grasses and a declining abundance of tall herb species, in particular at a high harvesting frequency. Concomitant with these taxonomic changes, we observed changes in the trait composition of the community. The abundance of tall species declined in the tall herb fringe and in the tall grass community. Similarly, the abundance of productive species (as indicated by high Ellenberg N and Ellenberg R values) declined in the tall herb fringe (in areas harvested four times per year). We conclude that low frequency harvesting is a promising management strategy to increase plant diversity in buffer strips with an initially low diversity and high productivity and that harvesting over time can mediate a shift in compositional patterns toward less productive species.

AB Benthic marine biodiversity on the Antarctic continental shelf is high and unique, yet its distributional patterns are still relatively poorly understood. Some of the main issues are that biological data are sparse, and that many species are rare and seem only weakly related to environmental conditions. Grouping species by taxonomic or functional similarity has historically been used to compensate for missing species identification, to generate a more widespread distribution of data-points, and this practice can help to gain a better understanding of the distribution of biodiversity. However, there are few guidelines on how to group species, the implicit assumptions about species associations in the groups are difficult to validate, and the information loss associated with grouping species is unknown. Here, we analyse whether grouping benthic macrofaunal species by taxonomic or functional similarity preserves distributional patterns seen in species distributions, using a model-based approach called "species archetype model" that groups species or other units based on the similarity in their responses to environmental factors. Using presence-absence data, the species archetype models identify twice as many assemblages when used on the highest taxonomic resolution data, than when applied to taxonomic data at lower resolution (e.g., class) or functional groups based on mobility, feeding type, and body shape. Further, confidence in the predictions of either taxonomic or functional groups is far less than for predictions based on the highest taxonomic resolution data. Although using functional groups is often thought to accumulate species with similar environmental responses, our analysis shows that functional groups may insufficiently resolve assemblage structure for presence-absence data. Model-based approaches provide key information to understanding the regional distribution of Antarctic marine biodiversity, and care needs to be taken when using a-priori groupings of species to make statements about the distribution of biodiversity.

AB The gastric armature of decapod foregut is a feeding structure that sparks controversial debates about the role dietary and historical components have in shaping its morphological traits. Having previous information about the natural diet is an interesting way to gather evidence on this issue. For the present study, we analyzed the morphological traits of gastric ossicles involved directly in the maceration of food in nine species of freshwater crabs of the family Trichodactylidae (Brachyura: Decapoda) representing five genera, three tribes and two subfamilies. The analyzed gastric ossicles were quite consistent among closely related species, suggesting that the observed traits had a clear phylogenetic component. However, it was also noted that the morphological traits of the gastric teeth of trichodactylid crabs match well with the natural diet and presented likeness with general features of other species with a similar trophic habit. We discuss the influence of phylogeny and function on the design of morphological traits and propose to quantify the role of phylogeny and function in shaping morphological traits through the analysis of phylogenetic signals.

AB The complexity and scales of the processes that shape communities of marine benthic macroinvertebrates has limited our understanding of their assembly mechanisms and the potential to make projections of their spatial and temporal dynamics. Individual-based models can shed light on community assembly mechanisms, by allowing observed spatiotemporal patterns to emerge from first principles about the modeled organisms. Previous work in the Rance estuary (Brittany, France) revealed the principal functional components of its benthic macroinvertebrate communities and derived a set of functional relationships between them. These elements were combined here for the development of a dynamic and spatially explicit model that operates at two spatial scales. At the fine scale, modeling each individual's life cycle allowed the representation of recruitment, inter-and intra-group competition, biogenic habitat modification and predation mortality. Larval dispersal and environmental filtering due to the tidal characteristics of the Rance estuary were represented at the coarse scale. The two scales were dynamically linked and the model was parameterized on the basis of theoretical expectations and expert knowledge. The model was able to reproduce some patterns of alpha-and beta-diversity that were observed in the Rance estuary in 1995. Model analysis demonstrated the role of local and regional processes, particularly early post-settlement mortality and spatially restricted dispersal, in shaping marine benthos. It also indicated biogenic habitat modification as a promising area for future research. The combination of this mechanism with different substrate types, along with the representation of physical disturbances and more trophic categories, could increase the model's realism. The precise parameterization and validation of the model is expected to extend its scope from the exploration of community assembly mechanisms to the formulation of predictions about the responses of community structure and functioning to environmental change.

AB Aluminum (Al) stress is becoming the major limiting factor in crop production in acidic soils. Rice has been reported as the most Al-tolerant crop and the capacity of Al toxicity tolerance is generally evaluated by comparing root growth under Al stress. Here, we performed an association mapping of Al toxicity tolerance using a core collection of 211 indica rice accessions with 700 K high quality SNP data. A total of 21 putative QTL affecting shoot height (SH), root length (RL), shoot fresh weight (SFW), shoot dry weight (SDW), root dry weight (RDW) and shoot water content (SWC) were identified at seedling stage, including three QTL detected only under control condition, eight detected only under Al stress condition, ten simultaneously detected in both control and Al stress conditions, and seven were identified by stress tolerance index of their corresponding traits. Total of 21 candidate genes for 7 important QTL regions associated with Al toxicity tolerance were identified based on combined haplotype analysis and functional annotation, and the most likely candidate gene(s) for each important QTL were also discussed. Also a candidate gene Nratl on chromosome 2 was further fine-mapped using BSA-seq and linkage analysis in the F2 population derived from the cross of Al tolerant accession CC105 and super susceptible accession CC180. A new non-synonymous SNP variation was observed at Nratl between CC105 and CC180, which resulted in an amino-acid substitution from Ala (A) in CC105 to Asp (D) in CC180. Haplotype analysis of Nratl using 327 3K RGP accessions indicated that minor allele variations in aus and indica subpopulations decreased Al toxicity tolerance in rice. The candidate genes identified in this study provide valuable information for improvement of Al toxicity tolerance in rice. Our research indicated that minor alleles are important for QTL mapping and its application in rice breeding when natural gene resources are used.

AB Fjords are temperate zone coastal features with strong horizontal and vertical environmental gradients, but the composition and function of biota living on the confining walls are poorly documented due to relative inaccessibility. We present results from remotely operated vehicle imagery of the subphotic (50 to 680 m depth) bedrock walls from 3 sites in Douglas Channel, a northeast Pacific fjord complex. We assessed the composition and abundance of the wall fauna and correlated these data with the water mass flux character of the fjord. Using a suite of morphological traits, we also identified areas of high function through habitat formation. This baseline record of hard substratum benthos in Douglas Channel revealed diverse assemblages marked by vertical zonation, dense animal cover (>= 80% areal cover in some areas), and some variation from fjord head to mouth. The deepest portions of the fjord at our most seaward site (<= 400 m) harbored the most taxonomically and functionally rich assemblages, with multiple species exclusive to this zone; there was a sharp increase in animal cover in shallow (<= 150 m) areas caused by the appearance of dictyonine glass sponges and increases in articulate brachiopod, zoanthid, and encrusting sponge cover. Animal cover was positively correlated with winter kinetic energy density fluxes, indicating that a consistent oceanic influx augments biomass above 150 m most likely by increasing particle delivery rates. Our findings demonstrate that fjord walls support high biomass, high functioning, diverse, and expansive biosystems that warrant further study and con sideration when developing coastal ocean management plans.

AB Invasions of Ponto-Caspian fish species into north-western European river basins accelerated since the opening of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in 1992. Since 2002, at least five Ponto-Caspian alien fish species have arrived in The Netherlands. Four species belong to the Gobiidae family (Neogobius fluviatilis, Neogobius melanostomus, Ponticola kessleri, and Proterorhinus semilunaris) and one to the Cyprinidae family (Romanogobio These species are expected to be potentially deleterious for the populations of four native benthic fish species: Gobio gobio (Cyprinidae), Barbatula barbatula (Nemacheilidae), Cottus perifretum, and C. rhenanus (Cottidae). Invasion success may be dependent on competitive trophic interactions with native species, which are enabled and/or constrained by feeding-related morphological traits. Twenty-two functional feeding traits were measured in nine species (in total 90 specimens). These traits were quantitatively linked to the mechanical, chemical and behavioral properties of a range of aquatic resource categories, using a previously developed food-fish model (FFM). The FFM was used to predict the trophic profile (TP) of each fish: the combined capacities to feed on each of the resource types. The most extreme TPs belonged to three alien species, indicating that they were most specialized among the studied species. Of these three, only P. kessleri overlapped with the two native Cottusspecies, indicating potential trophic competition. N. fluviatilis and R. belingi did not show any overlap, indicating that there is low trophic competition. The two remaining alien goby species (N. melanostomus and P. semilunaris) had average TPs and could be considered generalist feeders. They overlapped with each other and with G. gobio and B. barbatula, indicating potential trophic competition. This study suggests that both generalist and specialist species can be successful invaders. Since the FFM predicts potential interactions between species, it provides a tool to support horizon scanning and rapid risk assessments of alien species.

AB Trait-based community ecology promises an understanding of the factors that determine species abundances and distributions across habitats. However, ecologists are often faced with large suites of potentially important traits, making generalizations across ecosystems and species difficult or even impossible. Here, we hypothesize that key traits structuring ecological communities may be causally dependent on common physiological mechanisms and that elucidating these mechanisms can help us understand the distributions of traits and species across habitats. We test this hypothesis by investigating putatively causal relationships between physiological and behavioral traits at the species and community levels in larvae of 17 species of dragonfly that co-occur at the landscape scale but segregate among lakes. We use tools borrowed from phenotypic selection analyses to show that physiological traits underlie activity rate, which has opposing effects on foraging and predator avoidance behaviors. The effect of activity on these behaviors ultimately shapes species distributions and community composition in habitats with either large-bodied fish or invertebrates as top predators. Remarkably, despite the inherent complexity of ecological communities, the expression of just two biomolecules accounts for a high proportion of the variation in behavioral traits and hence, dragonfly community composition between habitats. We suggest that causal relationships among traits can drive species distributions and community assembly.

AB The Arctic's Barrow Canyon, located in the northeastern Chukchi and western Beaufort seas, supports a rich and diverse benthic ecosystem and is often termed an ecological "hotspot" of productivity. Within and adjacent to Barrow Canyon, the epibenthic invertebrate communities vary, with biomass and taxonomic distributions related to habitat variation. Here we asked if the patterns observed are due to Barrow Canyon's variation in near-seafloor physical hydrography, and whether differences in taxonomic distribution also reflect differences in functional properties of the epibenthic invertebrate community. Data were collected using a standardized 83-112 bottom trawl during two surveys in and adjacent to Barrow Canyon: the northeast Chukchi Sea survey in 2013 and the western Beaufort Sea survey in 2008. A portion of the Beaufort Sea survey also used a liner to retain smaller organisms. A suite of nine environmental variables were examined, that included depth, bottom water temperature, bottom hardness as measured by acoustics, and circulation model hindcast current speed. They explained 18-47% of observed variance for each of the three data sets (Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea lined net (LN), Beaufort Sea unlined net (UN)). In the Chukchi Sea, bottom hardness and depth were significant variables. In the Beaufort Sea LN hauls, depth, bottom temperature, and the mean current speed on the day of sampling were significant variables and in the Beaufort Sea UN hauls, depth was the only significant variable. Of the 150 + collected taxa from each survey, similar to 20 made up 90% of the total biomass in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, and six of the 20 taxa were common to both study areas. We used biological traits analysis (BTA) of body morphology, trophic, and reproductive traits to further characterize the epibenthos at the head of Barrow Canyon in the Chukchi Sea and into Barrow Canyon in the Beaufort Sea. Although the Chukchi and Beaufort seas differed taxonomically in abundance and distribution, they were functionally similar based on the biological traits we examined. A traits analysis can advance knowledge of a community of organisms; however, it is most informative if used as a complement to a taxonomic composition analysis of abundance and distribution.

AB Biofilms are dynamic consortia of microorganism that play a key role in freshwater ecosystems. By changing their community structure, biofilms respond quickly to environmental changes and can be thus used as indicators of water quality. Currently, biofilm assessment is mostly based on integrative and functional endpoints, such as photosynthetic or respiratory activity, which do not provide information on the biofilm community structure. Flow cytometry and computational visualization offer an alternative, sensitive, and easy-to-use method for assessment of the community composition, particularly of the photoautotrophic part of freshwater biofilms. It requires only basic sample preparation, after which the entire sample is run through the flow cytometer. The single-cell optical and fluorescent information is used for computational visualization and biological interpretation. Its main advantages over other methods are the speed of analysis and the high-information-content nature. Flow cytometry provides information on several cellular and biofilm traits in a single measurement: particle size, density, pigment content, abiotic content in the biofilm, and coarse taxonomic information. However, it does not provide information on biofilm composition on the species level. We see high potential in the use of the method for environmental monitoring of aquatic ecosystems and as an initial biofilm evaluation step that informs downstream detailed investigations by complementary and more detailed methods.

AB Marine sponges are early-branched metazoans known to harbor dense and diverse microbial communities. Yet the role of the so far uncultivable alphaproteobacterial lineages that populate these sessile invertebrates remains unclear. We applied a sequence composition-dependent binning approach to assemble
   one Rhodospirillaceaegenome from the Spongia officinalis microbial metagenome and contrast its functional features with those of closely related sponge-associated and free-living genomes. Both symbiotic and free-living Rhodospirillaceae shared a suite of common features, possessing versatile carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus metabolisms. Symbiotic genomes could be distinguished from their free-living counterparts by the lack of chemotaxis and motility traits, enrichment of genes required for the uptake and utilization of organic sulfur compounds-particularly taurine-, higher diversity and abundance of ABC transporters, and a distinct repertoire of genes involved in natural product biosynthesis, plasmid stability, cell detoxification and oxidative stress remediation. These sessile symbionts may more effectively contribute to host fitness via nutrient exchange, and also host detoxification and chemical defense. Considering the worldwide occurrence and high diversity of sponge-associated Rhodospirillaceae verified here using a tailored in silico approach, we suggest that these organisms are not only relevant to holobiont homeostasis but also to nutrient cycling in benthic ecosystems.

AB The response units of protozoan communities, based on a community-weighted mean (CWM) dataset across trait-taxon space, were investigated in order to determine their utility as bioindicators of marine water quality. From a total of 17 functional categories of seven biological traits, three functional response units (FRUs) were identified at correlation levels of > 0.75. FRUs 1 and 3 generally dominated the communities in more polluted areas during warm seasons, while FRU2 appeared to prefer less polluted waters and dominated the communities in spring and winter. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the CWM values of FRUs 1 and 3 were significantly positively correlated to the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), whereas those of FRU2 were negatively correlated to COD. Across taxon-function space, 16 species were identified as potential bioindicators of water quality. These results suggest that redundancy analysis across trait-taxon space is a useful tool for identifying indicators of environmental quality.

AB In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the functional diversity of benthic ciliates has high potential to monitor marine ecological status. Therefore, we investigated the spatial and temporal variation of functional diversity of benthic ciliates in the Yangtze Estuary during one year using biological traits analyses and functional diversity indices. Traits and community compositions showed clear spatial and temporal variations. Among a variety of biological traits, feeding type and body size emerged as strongest predictable variables. Functional divergence (FDiv) had an advantage over two other functional diversity indices, as well as over classical diversity measures (i.e. richness, evenness, Shannon-Wiener) to infer environmental status. Significant correlations between biological traits, FDiv and environmental variables (i.e. nutrients, temperature, salinity) suggested that functional diversity of benthic ciliates might be used as a bio-indicator in environmental status assessments. Further mandatory researches need to implement functional diversity of ciliates in routine monitoring programs were discussed.

AB Functional trait approaches have greatly improved the mechanistic understanding of the impacts of biodiversity in ecosystem. We evaluated how hydrological gradients (i.e., soil water content and elevation) affected the taxonomic diversity, functional identity, and functional diversity and assessed how changes in these measures of diversity ultimately drove variations in above-ground biomass (AGB). Results showed that a combination of hydrological gradients and functional trait composition (i.e., the community weighted means, the single-trait functional diversity and the multiple-trait functional diversity) better explained variations (40.8%) of AGB. No significant relationships between taxonomic diversity and AGB were observed. The dominant species became taller with thicker stem, and co-occurring species showed greater divergent distribution of stem diameter towards higher soil water content. As elevation increased, the dominant plant had thinner leaves with later onset of flowering and longer flowering duration, and co-occurring species showed less divergent distribution of lamina thickness and leaf dry-mass content. Our results highlighted that the positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relations were largely attributed to the co-operations of selection and complementary effects, as evidences showed that the dominant trait values (i.e., community weighted mean of shoot height) and trait diversity (i.e., functional evenness) improved biomass production of wetland plants.

AB Balancing the water demand between human usage and ecosystems remains a challenge in water-limited regions where one of the main groundwater uses is short-term pumping. A 23-day pumping test was performed in a semiarid site of north-west China to test the hypothesis that native phreatophytes can tolerate short-term pumping. The monitoring indicated that sap flow velocity of groundwater-dependent willow trees began to decrease on Day 4 after pumping and almost fully recovered on Day 9 after the cessation of pumping. Numerical simulations using HYDRUS-1D were conducted for the period of 1954-2013 to assess the response of phreatophytes to groundwater withdrawal under various climatic conditions. The modelling results reveal that phreatophytes can recover from the stress induced by groundwater pumping because they can adapt to short periods of water stress using physiological and morphological traits and the degree of water stress depends on the amount and/or frequency of rainfall during and after pumping. Therefore, pulsed pumping, under particular climatic conditions, could be used to reduce negative impacts of groundwater extraction on phreatophytes, while still providing groundwater for socio-economic activities in semiarid zones.

AB The objective of the study is to evaluate the fatty acid profile, oxidative stability, and other associated quality attributes of broiler chicken meat as affected by feeding ration containing flaxseed, broken rice, and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). Six dietary treatments are formulated with no flaxseed in the first one and 10% in the other five; and 20% broken rice, 40% broken rice, 5% DDGS, and 10% DDGS in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth treatments, respectively. No dietary effects are observed on body weight gain, but 10% flaxseed along with either broken rice or DDGS increases feed intake of birds. The flaxseed significantly reduces feed efficiency of birds which is further reduces by 10% DDGS. The flaxseed significantly increases the -3 PUFA, -3:-6, PUFA:SFA, MUFA:SFA, UFA:SFA ratios with consequent decrease in percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFA), atherogenic index, and thrombogenic index of broiler chicken meat, which is furthered by DDGS inclusion. Flaxseed inclusion significantly reduces cholesterol, fat, water holding capacity (WHC), and antioxidant capacity, whereas, it increases the pH (fresh meat), drip loss, and lipid peroxidation of broiler chicken meat. Inclusion of DDGS levels further increases drip loss, and lipid peroxidation, whereas, it further reduces WHC, extract release volume (ERV), and antioxidant capacity of broiler chicken meat. The study indicates that inclusion of 10% flaxseed along with 5% or 10% DDGS improves chicken meat fatty acid profiles, health related indices, and reduces the cholesterol and fat content, but compromises the feed efficiency of birds and the oxidative stability of meat.Practical Application: The inclusion of 10% flaxseed along with 5% or 10% DDGS increases PUFA content, -3/-6 ratio, and decreases the saturated fatty acid content of broiler chicken meat. The 10% flaxseed also reduces the cholesterol and fat content of meat. This designed meat can help reduce the incidences of cardiovascular diseases. The flaxseed and DDGS inclusion reduces WHC and increases drip loss which may have detrimental effects on further processing of meat. However, both flaxseed and DDGS inclusion compromises the oxidative stability of meat and feed efficiency of birds which reflects badly on shelf life of meat and profitability of broiler production. Thus, it needs to be addressed by adding suitable antioxidant in the broiler ration. As a result of changing food habits among people cardiovascular diseases are on the rise, the treatment costs of which are economically highly regressive. Here comes into play, the famous quote of Hippocrates Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food. Designing the food we eat will help prevent these cardiovascular diseases. In this regard flaxseed and DDGS inclusion in broiler chicken ration results in -3 fatty acid enriched meat with health promoting effects.

AB Marine caves are unique and vulnerable habitats exhibiting high biodiversity and heterogeneity, but threatened by multiple global and local disturbances. Marine caves, although widely distributed along the Mediterranean coast, suffer for the lack of quantitative data on their structure and function, which hinder their conservation status assessment. Thanks to the availability of a nearly 30-year-long series of data (1986-2013), we evaluated ecosystem change in the Bergeggi marine cave (Ligurian Sea, NW Mediterranean), a cave with a complex shape and high habitat heterogeneity. Non-taxonomic descriptors were adopted, namely growth forms (GF) and trophic guilds (TG), which are informative about ecosystem structure and functioning, respectively. The cave experienced a general trend of change during the last three decades, mainly due to the decline in the cover of sessile organisms (especially 3-dimensional forms) matched by an increase of turf and sediment, thus causing the structural and functional homogenization of the cave community. While change before 2004 had been attributed to climatic factors (especially to the summer heat waves of 1999 and 2003), the most important rate of change was observed between 2009 and 2013, coinciding with recent major beach nourishments and the extension of the neighbouring Vado Ligure harbour, thus providing evidences on the importance of local disturbances deriving from coastal interventions. Monitoring the status of cave ecosystems is urgently needed, and the use of effective indicators, such as the specific traits here adopted (morphology and feeding strategy), could provide effective tools to assist marine cave conservation.

AB Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) was used to identify functional features of infaunal polychaete assemblages associated with contamination in two Italian coastal areas: the harbour of Trieste (Adriatic Sea) and the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Ionian Sea). The analysis was performed on 103 taxa, collected at four stations in each area. The two areas differed in species composition. The low diversity and the presence of stress-tolerant species in more polluted sites were not reflected in functional diversity, due to species contributing little to community functions or being functionally redundant. Sand and clay fractions were significant drivers of trait category expressions, however other environmental parameters (depth, total organic carbon and nitrogen, and Hg in sediments) influenced traits composition. Motile was the prevalent trait in environments with coarse sediments, and tube-builder were related to fine-grained ones. Motile, endobenthic and burrower were essential traits for living in contaminated sediments. Epibenthic and sessile polychaetes dominated at stations subjected to high organic loads. BTA offers an integrative approach to detect functional adaptations to contaminated sediments and multiple anthropogenic stressors.

AB Trawling activities are considered to be one of the main sources of disturbance to the seabed worldwide. We aimed to disentangle the dominance of environmental variations and trawling intensity in order to explain the distribution of diversity patterns over 152 sampling sites in the French trawl fishing-ground, the Grande Vasiere. Using a towed underwater video device, we identified 39 taxa to the finest taxonomic level possible, which were clustered according to their vulnerability to trawling disturbance based on functional traits. Using generalized linear models, we investigated whether the density distribution of each vulnerability group was sensitive to trawling intensity and habitat characteristics. Our analyses revealed a structuring effect of depth and substratum on community structure. The distribution of the more vulnerable group was a negative function of trawling intensity, while the distributions of the less vulnerable groups were independent of trawling intensity. Video monitoring coupled with trait-based vulnerability assessment of macro-epibenthic communities might be more relevant than the traditional taxonomic approach to identifying the areas that are most vulnerable to fishing activities in conservation planning.

AB Fish assemblages in tropical lowland rivers are characterized by a high richness of species that feed on a diverse array of food resources. Although closely related species often have similar feeding ecology, species within the family Cichlidae display a broad spectrum of trophic niches, and resource partitioning has been inferred from studies conducted in Neotropical rivers. We investigated interspecific variation in food resource use and its relationship to morphological variation among cichlid fishes within the Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve, a coastal area encompassing the delta of the Grijalva-Usumacinta River in Tabasco, Mexico. Most species consumed benthic crustaceans, aquatic insect larvae, and detritus, but some were more herbivorous, and one species was a specialized piscivore. Dietary niche overlap among species was higher than expected for one assemblage, and similar to random expectations for another, suggesting a lesser role for resource partitioning than has been shown for some cichlid assemblages, perhaps due to availability of abundant resources, even in low-water conditions. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that greatest morphological differences am7ong species involved functional traits directly associated with resource use. Relationships between feeding ecology and morphology were similar to those described for other riverine cichlids. Strong ecomorphological relationships facilitate inferences about the ecology of cichlid species, including species that currently lack data from field studies. Knowledge of ecological relationships will be important for conservation in the Pantanos de Centla, an ecosystem of global significance for biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB Hydrological seasonality of flow dictates diversity in tropical aquatic ecosystems. Large tropical rivers and tributaries are typically more depth and shows increased flow velocity and area in flood than in dry season. A thorough analysis of seasonality effect on fish community structure can provide valuable information of major forces driving tropical communities. However, these types of analyses have been limited by poor knowledge of tropical diversity, human impacts on environment, and biased sampling methods. We used a pristine large tropical river (and tributaries) and five types (12 gill nets, beach seine nets, longlines, branch baited hooks, and cast nets) of fishing gears to present an evaluation of flow seasonality effect on fish community. We sampled fourteen sites in river channel and tributaries in the lower Araguaia River. Sampling was conducted in flood (March and May 2009) and dry (July and September 2009) seasons of a typical seasonal year. Species richness, Shannon Diversity and Evenness, mean similarity of binary data, and abundance (CPUE) were analyzed by PERMANOVA and PCoA. We also analyzed the species most correlated (by Spearman correlation rank) with flood and dry season. Features differed significantly between flood and dry seasons, but not between channel and tributaries. The composition and abundance of community, and the representative species of flood and dry changed quite along the year. Flood showed lotic-related species, and dry presented lentic-related species. Thus, we achieved an alternation of fish community between season, both for channel and tributaries.

AB Over evolutionary time, predator-prey interactions have shaped and constrained functional and behavioral traits of piscivorous fishes. The endangered Colorado Pikeminnow Ptychocheilus lucius, a large endemic piscivore of the Colorado River Basin, encounters a substantially altered prey base that differs in behaviors and morphologies compared to the historical suite of native prey. To assess physical limitations of Colorado Pikeminnow predation, we conducted a feeding experiment with two species of nonnative prey (spined and despined Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus and Red Shiner Cyprinella lutrensis) and quantified scaling of cranial morphology in this predator. In our predation experiments, Colorado Pikeminnow (215-312 mm total length) consumed both spined and despined Channel Catfish as well as Red Shiner but only consumed prey less than 20% of the predator's total length. Previous feeding trials using smaller Colorado Pikeminnow, with native and nonnative prey species, indicated they consumed prey up to 35% of their total length, suggesting relative prey size limits may decrease as this predator grows. Morphological measurements also suggested relative prey size suitability may decrease as Colorado Pikeminnow become larger, with head depth and width demonstrating isometric scaling at small sizes and shifting to negative allometry as fish get larger. Together, these data suggest an ontogenetic shift in the head morphology of Colorado Pikeminnow may decrease the relative size of prey available to these predators. In severely altered systems, understanding trophic characteristics that limit overall predator resource availability will be critical for conservation of piscivorous fishes.

AB Disturbance in lotic ecosystems strongly influences which animals can survive and how those ecosystems function. Flow disturbances physically remove animals and periphyton, but it is unclear whether physical removal of individuals or the loss of food is the principal driver of effects of flow disturbances on invertebrate communities. Invertebrates possess traits that help them withstand high flows or recolonize rapidly after floods. At light-limited, closed-canopy sites, periphyton biomass should be unaffected by disturbances, so disturbance should affect invertebrate community trait composition by direct removal of animals. At open-canopy sites, disturbance should affect trait composition by both removing individuals and reducing periphyton food resources. We investigated whether a trait-based approach could elucidate drivers of effects of flow disturbance on benthic invertebrate communities and better identify potential mechanistic linkages. We sampled 10 autotrophic streams that differed in substrate-disturbance regime and varied from 100 to 0% canopy cover. We sampled 2 sites per stream, 1 in forest (closed-canopy) and 1 downstream in low-intensity agricultural grassland (open-canopy). Regardless of canopy, in streams with greater substrate disturbance, the proportion of individuals that respired with a plastron increased and proportions of individuals having 2 aquatic life stages or that were filter-feeders decreased. At open-canopy sites, the proportion of collector?gatherers with flattened bodies increased with increased substrate disturbance and decreased periphyton biomass, and the proportion of taxa having high body flexibility and 2 aquatic life stages increased with decreased substrate disturbance and increased periphyton biomass. Trait composition of these mountain stream invertebrate communities is strongly influenced by physical removal via substrate movement and by reduced periphyton resources.

AB 1. Restoration of ecosystems can mitigate the global loss of biodiversity and provide essential ecological functions and services. Although trait composition and functional diversity (FD) are important tools in assessing recovery processes, very few restoration projects use them to evaluate restoration success. Consequently, little is known about trait and FD trajectories following restoration measures.
   2. Here, we tested the effect of dyke-slotting to reconnect a floodplain on the trait response of mollusc communities over 6 years, based on a random stratified sampling design (plots within areas) with before and after control impact. Trait characteristics included flood resistance, drought resistance and resilience from which community-weighted mean trait values were derived. FD and its components (alpha, beta, gamma) were calculated with Rao's quadratic entropy.
   3. Flood duration in the restored area increased from 4-13 to 6-17 weeks/year after reconnection, similarly to the reference area (4-10 to 6-14 weeks). Hence, the re-connection by dyke-slotting had no substantial effect on flood duration (due to seepage water).
   4. Despite that, dyke-slotting triggered weak but significant shifts in the trait compositions of the restored floodplain mollusc communities. Traits reflecting species' resilience, crushing resistance and drought resistance increased in abundance, while traits characteristically found in more stable habitats decreased (e.g. cross-fertilisation, diet specialisation). Overall, trait composition of the restored area progressively moved to that found in the active floodplain.
   5. While there were some significant temporal changes in FD within areas (reference, restored), there were no significant effects of dyke-slotting on any of the FD indices.
   6. The incorporation of spatiotemporal dynamics of FD and trait composition may facilitate the evaluation of restoration trajectories, especially when different components (hierarchical FD configuration, single trait distributions) are considered together. Such complementary approaches could be integrated in future restoration monitoring programs.

AB 1. Non-native species are now common in community assemblages, but the influence of multiple introductions on ecosystem functioning remains poorly understood. In highly invaded systems, one promising approach is to use functional traits to scale measured individuals' effects on ecosystem function up to the community level. This approach assumes that functional traits provide a common currency among species to relate individuals to ecosystem functioning.
   2. The goals of this study were to (i) test whether the relationship between body size and ecosystem functioning (per capita nutrient recycling) was best described by general or species-specific scaling models; (ii) relate community structure (total biomass, average body size, non-native dominance) to aggregated, community-level nutrient recycling rates and ratios; and (iii) determine whether conclusions regarding the relationships between community structure and aggregate ecosystem functioning differed between species-specific and general scaling approaches.
   3. By combining experimental incubations and field surveys, we compare consumer-mediated nutrient recycling of fish communities along a non-native dominance gradient in the Verde River watershed of central Arizona, USA. Data from 340 field-sampled freshwater fish demonstrated support for general allometric relationships predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology (NH4-N scaling coefficient = 0.72 [0.64-0.80]; PO4-P = 0.67 [0.47-0.86]). However, the best-fit models for N and P included species-specific random effects for both allometric slopes and intercepts.
   4. According to species-specific models, stream fish communities recycled 1-12 mmol NH4-N/hr (median = 2.8 mmol/hr) and 0.02-0.74 mmol PO4-P/hr (median = 0.07 mmol/hr) at N:P ratios between 13.3 and 83.5 (median = 28.8). General models generated similar estimates for NH4-N recycling but less accurate estimates for PO4-P. Stochastic simulations that incorporated error around allometric parameter estimates led to qualitatively similar but larger differences between general and species-specific results.
   5. Community structure influenced aggregate nutrient recycling, but specific conclusions depended on the scaling approach. Total biomass explained much of the among-community variation in aggregate NH4-N and PO4-P for both model types, whereas non-native dominance alone best predicted variation in aggregate N:P. Surprisingly, species-specific and general models both reached significant yet quantitatively opposing conclusions regarding the relationship between N:P supply and non-native dominance.
   6. Study results indicate that shifting fish community structure can substantially alter ecosystem functioning in this river system. However, some inferred relationships between community structure and aggregate nutrient recycling varied depending on whether general or species-specific scaling approaches were taken. Although trait-based approaches to link environmental change, community structure and ecosystem function hold much promise, it will be important to consider when species-specific versus general models are necessary to scale from individuals to ecosystems.

AB Increasing salinity in freshwater ecosystems is globally widespread, especially, in arid and semi-arid regions, and can co-occur with flow intermittency, particularly in temporary streams. Both these stressors are known to affect macroinvertebrate traits individually, but their interactive effects have not been previously considered. There are inconsistencies reported in the literature regarding the response of particular traits to flow or salinity, and accordingly, we hypothesized that interactive effects between these two stressors may underlie inconsistencies in the literature. We used multivariate and univariate approaches to investigate the effects of salinity and flow interactions on macroinvertebrate traits using 13 years of data sampled across multiple sites in South Australia, the driest state in the driest inhabited continent in the world. Ovoviviparity, multivoltinism, aerial respiration and strong fliers were favoured as salinity increased, while medium-high physiological sensitivity to salinity and respiration via gills decreased. During low flows, holometaboly, univoltinism, high rheophily, cool eurythermality, streamlined body shape and gill respiration decreased, while aerial respiration and fliers and high crawling rate increased. Interestingly, traits with inconsistent responses (e.g. burrowing, tegument respiration and collector-gathering traits) in the literature were associated with interactions between flow and salinity in our study. These traits showed a similar interaction, by being least abundant in streams with high salinity and low flows, and low salinity and high flows. The interactions seem to be driven by the differential response of different taxa with the same trait category being abundant in different parts of the interaction plot. Our findings suggest that, in addition to differences in methodological and analytical approaches, interactions may also underlie inconsistencies in trait responses to flow and salinity. Finally, to foster the operative use of traits to resolve the effects of multiple stressors on ecosystems, there is the need for a better mechanistic understanding of how specific stressors (e.g. flow and salinity) act as trait filters, potentially through the use of experiments, to ensure that each of the stressors is strong enough to produce clear trait responses.

AB Interspecific trait variability (e.g., functional diversity) is often correlated with community productivity and thus promotes ecosystem stability. However, we know little about how intraspecific trait variability mediated the effects of environmental gradients on population stability. We applied generalized multilevel path models to investigate multivariate causal hypotheses that environmental effects on population stability of a macrophyte species - Potamogeton maackianus - are mediated by physiological and morphological traits variability. Using a hierarchical nested design, we measured quarterly nine physiological traits, and monthly ten morphological traits from 9720 individuals at 27 plots along water depth gradients in Lake Erhai, China. Results showed that changes in water depth and light availability caused significant shifts in intraspecific trait variability, with cascading direct and indirect effects on temporal stability of P. maackianus. Water depth exerted major control over population stability, both directly and indirectly via shifts in morphological and physiological traits. Light availability affected population stability indirectly by altering morphological traits. Size traits (shoot morphology and root/shoot ratio) and metabolic traits captured the effect of water depth and light availability on population stability with a relative high accuracy. Our study provide a strong support to the hypothesis that intraspecific trait variability mediate the combined effects of variations on water depth and light conditions on the temporal stability of a dominant macrophtye species in Lake Erhai. Maintaining and enhancing trait variability within plant populations may help to buffer negative effects of anthropogenic environmental changes on population stability.

AB We used the individual-based multidimensional functional diversity and the taxonomic approaches in a complementary way to describe phytoplankton communities in three coastal lagoons with different eutrophication status in the South of France. We sampled communities during three seasons, i.e., in autumn, spring, and summer. Using classical taxonomy, 107 taxa/morphotypes were identified in the nine communities. The individual-based functional approach allowed grouping these individuals into 20 functional entities according to their values for 5 traits related to trophic adaptations (cell size, mobility, trophic regime, coloniality, and pelagic/benthic life). Some species (e.g., Prorocentrum micans) emerged in multiple functional entities, showing the importance to consider intraspecific variability. The functional description of phytoplankton communities better reflected the hydrological functioning and the different eutrophication status of the lagoons than the taxonomic approach. Specific functional adaptations were identified in the nine communities. For example, phytoplankton organisms with heterotrophic and potentially mixotrophic abilities occurred when the availability of inorganic nutrient decreased, or when organic matter and small preys were potentially the main nutrient resources. The limitation has also favored small cells highly competitive for nutrients. Using functional indices together with taxonomic description has also helped revealing important aspects of community assembly, such as competitive exclusion in summer.

AB Trail-based ecology has been developed for decades lo infer ecosystem responses to stressors based on the functional structure of communities, yet its value in species-poor systems is largely unknown. Here, we used an extensive clataset in a Spanish region highly prone to non-native fish invasions (15 catchments, N 389 sites) to assess for the first time how species-poor communities respond to large-scale environmental gradients using a taxonomic and functional trait-based approach in riverine fish. We examined total species richness and three functional trait-based indices available when many sites have <= 3 species (specialization, FSpe; onginaliy, FOri and entropy, FEnt). We assessed the responses of these taxonomic and functional indices along gradients of altitude, water pollution, physical habitat degradation and non-native fish biomass. Whilst species richness was relatively sensitive to spatial effects, functional diversity indices were responsive across natural and anthropogenic gradients. All four diversity measures declined with altitude but this decline was modulated by physical habitat degradation (richness, FSpe and FEnt) and the non-native total fish biomass ratio (FSpe and FOri) in ways that varied between indices. Furthermore, FSpe and FOri were significantly correlated with Total Nitrogen. Non-native fish were a major component of the taxonomic and functional structure of fish communities, raising concerns about potential misdiagnosis between invaded and environmentally-degraded river reaches. Such misdiagnosis was evident in a regional fish index widely used in official monitoring programs. We recommend the application of FSpe and FOri to extensive clatasets from monitoring programs in order to generate valuable cross-system information about the impacts of non-native species and habitat degradation, even in species-poor systems. Scoring non-native species apart from habitat degradation in the indices used to determine ecosystem health is essential to develop better management strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB General colonization concepts consent that a slow process of microhabitat formation and subsequent niche realization occurs during early stages after new habitat is released. Subsequently, only few species are able to colonize new habitat in the early onset of succession, while species richness increases steadily over time. Although most colonization studies have been performed in terrestrial ecosystems, running water ecosystems are equally or even more prone to colonization after disturbance due to their dynamic nature. We question how invertebrate succession patterns reconcile with general colonization concepts. With this study we provide insight into the colonization process in newly created lowland stream trajectories and answer how within-stream bio- and functional diversity develops over time. Our results show a rapid influx of species, with a wide range of functional traits, during the first season after water flow commenced. During more than two years of regular monitoring, immigration rates were highest in autumn, marking the effects of seasonality on invertebrate dispersal. Biodiversity increased while abundance peaks of species alternated between seasons. Moreover, also days since start of the experiment explains a considerable part of the variability for taxa as well as traits. However, the relative trait composition remained similar throughout the entire monitoring period and only few specific traits had significantly higher proportions during specific seasons. This indicates that first phase colonization in freshwater streams can be a very rapid process that results in a high biodiversity and a large variety of species functional characteristics from the early onset of succession, contradicting general terrestrial colonization theory.

AB Riparian vegetation is important for stream functioning and as a major landscape feature. For many riparian plants, shallow groundwater is an important source of water, particularly in areas where rainfall is low, either annually or seasonally, and when extended dry conditions prevail for all or part of the year. The nature of tree water relationships is highly complex. Therefore, we used multiple lines of evidence to determine the water sources used by the dominant tree species Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river red gum), growing in riparian and floodplain areas with varying depth to groundwater and stream perenniality. Dendrometer bands were used to measure diel, seasonal, and annual patterns of tree water use and growth. Water stable isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in plant xylem, soil water, and groundwater were measured to determine spatial and temporal patterns in plant water source use. Our results indicated riparian trees located on relatively shallow groundwater had greater growth rates, larger diel responses in stem diameter, and were less reactive to extended dry periods, than trees in areas of deep groundwater. These results were supported by isotope analysis that suggested all trees used groundwater when soil water stores were depleted at the end of the dry season, and this was most pronounced for trees with shallow groundwater. Trees may experience more frequent periods of water deficit stress and undergo reduced productivity in scenarios where water table accessibility is reduced, such as drawdown from groundwater pumping activities or periods of reduced rainfall recharge. The ability of trees to adapt to changing groundwater conditions may depend on the speed of change, the local hydrologic and soil conditions as well as the species involved. Our results suggest that E. camaldulesis growing at our study site is capable of utilizing groundwater even to depths >10 m, and stream perenniality is likely to be a useful indicator of riparian tree use of groundwater.

AB Freshwater mussels of the order Unionida provide important ecosystem functions and services. Unfortunately, some previously widespread species are now seriously endangered. To restore the historical range of the population of Unio crassus in the Biala River, southern Poland, the species was reintroduced into a series of 'stepping stones' joining two remnant populations. During the first phase of the study, the relationships between the abundance of U. crassus, physical habitat, and water quality were studied to assess reintroduction potential. In general, chemical water quality improved upstream from the existing population, favouring the decision for reintroduction, whereas morphological variables worsened. Mussel abundance was correlated negatively with the elevation and slope of channel, organic matter contents, and pH (exceeding 8.0), but positively with silt presence, water conductivity, and concentrations of HCO3, Ca+, and NO3-. During the second phase, adult individuals were introduced into one type of functional habitat-marginal channel sectors with still water and line sediment. Despite the initial very high rate of reproduction in some parts of the upper reach of the river, the juveniles were ultimately recruited only in the lower part of the restored range, resulting in a very rapid change in recruitment at a channel slope of 1.8 parts per thousand. Recruitment was positively related to silt content, conductivity, and Ca and HCO3- ions, negatively to channel elevation and slope, and water pH. The host fish species showed no correlation with abiotic habitat features within the studied reach. These results imply that most of the habitat traits related to U. crassus occurrence depended on the river's longitudinal profile, not on the chemical water quality, and that final success of introduction should be evaluated after several years.

AB Human activities, among which dredging and land use change in river basins, are altering estuarine ecosystems. These activities may result in changes in sedimentary processes, affecting biodiversity of sediment macrofauna. As macrofauna controls sediment chemistry and fluxes of energy and matter between water column and sediment, changes in the structure of macrobenthic communities could affect the functioning of an entire ecosystem. We assessed the impact of sediment deposition on intertidal macrobenthic communities and on rates of an important ecosystem function, i.e. sediment community oxygen consumption (SCOC). An experiment was performed with undisturbed sediment samples from the Scheldt river estuary (SW Netherlands). The samples were subjected to four sedimentation regimes: one control and three with a deposited sediment layer of 1, 2 or 5 cm. Oxygen consumption was measured during incubation at ambient temperature. Luminophores applied at the surface, and a seawater-bromide mixture, served as tracers for bioturbation and bio-irrigation, respectively. After incubation, the macrofauna was extracted, identified, and counted and then classified into functional groups based on motility and sediment reworking capacity. Total macrofaunal densities dropped already under the thinnest deposits. The most affected fauna were surficial and low-motility animals, occurring at high densities in the control. Their mortality resulted in a drop in SCOC, which decreased steadily with increasing deposit thickness, while bio-irrigation and bioturbation activity showed increases in the lower sediment deposition regimes but decreases in the more extreme treatments. The initial increased activity likely counteracted the effects of the drop in low-motility, surficial fauna densities, resulting in a steady rather than sudden fall in oxygen consumption. We conclude that the functional identity in terms of motility and sediment reworking can be crucial in our understanding of the regulation of ecosystem functioning and the impact of habitat alterations such as sediment deposition.

AB QuestionsFunctional interactions between fire and fire-dependent plant communities have been considered to select for increased community flammability. We address this concept by resolving: (a) can fossil pollen records be used to examine past variations in functional attributes; (b) can community-level, functional responses to fire be obtained by coupling fire history with pollen derived plant traits; and (c) has directional selection promoted attributes that increase community flammability?
   LocationBreitenbush Lake, Oregon, USA.
   MethodsWe developed a framework based on ecological understanding of functional traits and pollen records to analyse variations in functional attribute expressions through time. Fire-related functional attributes that indicate sensitivity to changes in fire activity were identified and associated with taxa from a pollen record.
   ResultsNine of the 14 functional attributes were significantly related to fire frequency (number of fires 1,000 per year). When combined with fire history data, variation in the abundances of functional attributes suggest selection of plant community expressions that indicate community-level responses to fire related to changes in structural development and changes in fire adaptation. Fire frequency variations may drive directional selection for fire-adapted attributes, and against fire-sensitive attributes. Our results indicate increased Holocene fire activity may have been linked to vegetation functional interactions with fire.
   ConclusionsOur method of combining paleoecological data with functional traits allowed reconstruction of community-level changes in the expression of functional characteristics, providing evidence on structural development and changes in fire adaptation. Our results (a) highlight the capacity of paleoecological records to track plant community trait composition; (b) provide novel information on fire-vegetation relationships, independent of and complementary to conventional methods of disturbance-based paleoecological interpretations; (c) suggest the Holocene fire trend may be linked to the type of biomass being burned through directional selection; and (d) suggest an application that may be applied to quantify community responses to various disturbances across broad temporal and spatial scales.

AB Understanding the amount of variation in functional traits between closely related species within guilds is critical for understanding links between community composition and ecosystem processes. Nutrient excretion is an important link between animals and their environments, and aquatic invertebrate communities can supply a considerable proportion of ecosystem nutrient demand via excretion. We quantified nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) excretion rates of 10 species of larval caddisflies that inhabit high-elevation ponds and wetlands to determine the magnitude of variation in nutrient excretion within this guild. We found considerable interspecific variation in biomass-specific excretion of nitrogen (eightfold differences), phosphorus (sevenfold differences), and the stoichiometric N:P ratios (fivefold differences). Through a meta-analysis, we compared the variation within this guild to the variation found in other family-level species assemblages to determine the overall range in the variation of nutrient excretion that could be expected across guilds and to determine whether the variation in this caddisfly guild is comparatively extreme, average, or low. The meta-analysis revealed a large range in variation among guilds, and comparatively, the variation within this caddisfly guild is high for N excretion and intermediate for P excretion. The considerable variation within guilds revealed by our meta-analysis suggests that functional redundancy among guild members is difficult to predict. Thus, some natural or human-caused species gains or losses within biological groupings such as guilds and trophic levels could have little or no effect on ecosystem processes, whereas others could have very large effects.

AB The application of a biological traits analysis, in the present study, has allowed benthic habitat sensitivities and their risk of impact to be mapped at a spatial scale appropriate for the assessment of the North Sea ecoregion. This study considered habitat impacts associated with five important marine sectors; bottom fishing, marine aggregate dredging, sediment disposal, renewable energy devices (tidal, waves, and wind) and the oil and gas sectors, both individually and cumulatively. The significance of the "actual" footprint of impact arising from these human activities and their associated pressures (sediment abrasion, sediment removal, smothering, and placement of hard structures) is presented and discussed. Notable differences in sensitivity to activities are seen depending on habitat type. Some of the more substantial changes in benthic habitat function evaluated are potentially associated with the placement of hard structures in shallow mobile sedimentary habitats, which result in a shift in habitat dominated by small, short-living infaunal species, to a habitat dominated by larger, longer-lived, sessile epibenthic suspension feeders. In contrast, the impacts of bottom fishing, dredging and disposal activities are all assessed to be most severe when executed in deep, sedimentary habitats. Such assessments are important in supporting policies (e. g. spatial planning) directed towards ensuring sustainable " blue-growth," through a better understanding of the potential ecological impacts associated with human activities operating across different habitat types. The aim of this study is to provide a better understanding of the spatial extent of selected human activities and their impacts on seabed habitats using a biological trait-based sensitivity analysis.

AB The antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) has been detected in household wastewaters (untreated and treated) and receiving environments across the globe. The toxic effects of TCS on temperate standard aquatic test organisms have been widely reported with microalgae being the most sensitive. However, environmental differences between tropical and temperate regions may have selected different trait compositions between these two regions, which in turn may lead to a difference in species sensitivity. Therefore, additional information is required to better characterize risks to organisms in tropics and ensure biodiversity in these regions is not adversely impacted. This study aims to supplement existing TCS toxicity data with five aquatic invertebrates found in tropics and to compare the sensitivity between aquatic invertebrate species from tropical and temperate regions. In addition, the effect of pH on the toxicity of neutral and ionized forms of TCS to microalgae (Chlorella ellipsoidea) was investigated. The reported 96-h LC50 values for the studied invertebrate species ranged from 72 to 962 mu g/L. There was no significant difference between the sensitivity of aquatic invertebrate species from tropical and temperate regions. EC50 values for C. ellipsoidea, with and without pH buffer, were significantly different. The findings of this study can be used to support site-specific water quality criteria and environmental risk assessment for TCS in tropical regions. However, further chronic and semi-field experiments with TCS could potentially enable a refined assessment of direct and indirect effects on tropical aquatic communities and further explore functional endpoints of tropical ecosystems.

AB Food quality of freshwater consumers is often defined as the relative supply of carbon (C) to phosphorus (P) in diet. The growth rate hypothesis makes mechanistic links between P supply, ribosome biogenesis, and growth, with subsequent impacts on other life history traits such as age at maturity and clutch size. However, we know surprisingly little about the role and importance of other elements in impacting life histories of freshwater zooplankton. Because there is much evidence indicating a pivotal role for iron (Fe) in oogenesis, we hypothesized that dietary Fe content will invoke distinct effects on consumer life history compared to P. We tested this hypothesis in four species of Daphnia, by characterizing the relative impact of P and Fe on life history traits, and also measuring changes in Fe kinetics in response to dietary P and Fe. We found that while P had the largest influence on growth rate, Fe was particularly important in impacting reproductive traits. Radiotracer (Fe-55) analyses revealed differences in the acquisition and retention rates of Fe between two species of Daphnia. Finally, we found that P- and Fe-supply driven differences in growth and reproduction had significant effects on population growth. These results indicate that Fe can constrain production of freshwater zooplankton. Understanding the interaction between the supply of P in relation to trace elements should provide a clearer picture on how stoichiometric constraints are realized in lakes.

AB The enactment of environmental legislation and subsequent improvements in wastewater treatment during the late 20th century resulted in improved water quality for many large rivers in developed countries. Yet, little is known about how these improvements affected the functional diversity of aquatic assemblages, or of its relationship with species diversity during recovery. We examined species richness (SR), functional dispersion (FDis), and functional evenness (FEve) changes in four reaches of the Illinois River, USA, during a recovery period (1983-2010). The functional indices were based on fish habitat and foraging traits and weighted with either abundance or biomass. Though most correlations of the indices with SR were weak, additional species tended to increase FDis and decrease FEve. Biomass-weighted functional dispersion (FDis(w)) and SR consistently increased during the recovery, while the responses of FEve and abundance weighted FDis were much more variable. FDis(w) was better explained by improvements in water quality in all but the least impacted reach, where SR was best explained. Un-ionized ammonia, phosphorus, phenols, and water clarity were among the most important predictors of biodiversity changes. Increases in habitat and foraging specialized species appeared to contribute equally to functional changes in the three more degraded reaches, whereas increases in habitat specialization had a greater impact on FDis(w) changes in the least impacted reach. Later stage recovery of habitat specialist fishes in the absence of major habitat alterations indicates habitat improvement projects should be undertaken following water quality remediation. Functional diversity and species richness are complementary and both should be assessed to detect the responses of fish assemblages to environmental alterations. Biomass may better reflect functional changes in response to disturbance than abundance and should be assessed when estimating functional diversity.

AB The assessment of the status of marine ecosystems is still a major challenge, because in general we lack well established ecosystem-based monitoring programs. The coast of central Chile is subjected to moderate but historic fishing pressure by small-scale fisheries. In spite of the increasing evidences of the impact of fishing. beyond target species, there is a lack of systematic ecosystem-based assessments. We focused on this problem with the goal of identifying community components, based on a Biological Traits Analysis, that respond to fishing activities to ultimately define ecosystem health. We sampled a set of study sites subjected to benthic invertebrate gathering, and more recently to kelp harvesting. Sites included paired fishery restricted and open access areas where mobile invertebrates and sessile benthos were surveyed. In addition, kelp density and size structure were assessed in two sites subjected to kelp harvesting (also pairing restricted and open access areas). Target species exhibited higher densities in fishery-restricted areas. Fisheries restricted-areas also showed overall higher richness and redundancy of biological traits. Otherwise, we observed high variability in the structure of sessile benthos linked to small-scale heterogeneity of the seabed. The areas subjected to kelp harvesting exhibited variability in mobile invertebrates' composition between fishing access regimes, whereas no effects could be detected by only considering target species. Current monitoring efforts seem to be well-suited to address target species but fail to inform on ecosystem health in an area with increasing signs of community-wide effects from fishing. Therefore, we recommend future monitoring schemes targeting community components, beyond commercial species' densities, at different scales.

AB In arid and semiarid regions, where few if any trees are native, city trees are largely human planted. Societal factors such as resident preferences for tree traits, nursery offerings, and neighborhood characteristics are potentially key drivers of urban tree community composition and diversity, however, they remain critically understudied. We investigated patterns of urban tree structure in residential neighborhoods of the Salt Lake Valley, Utah, combining biological variables, such as neighborhood and plant nursery tree species and trait composition, and sociological data comprised of resident surveys and U.S. Census data. We sampled nine neighborhoods that varied in household income and age of homes. We found more tree species were offered in locally owned nurseries compared with mass merchandiser stores and yard trees at private residences were more diverse than public street trees in the same neighborhoods. There were significant differences among neighborhoods in street and yard tree composition. Newer neighborhoods differed from older neighborhoods in street tree species composition and trait diversity, while neighborhoods varying in affluence differed in yard tree composition. Species richness of yard trees was positively correlated with neighborhood household income, while species richness of street trees was negatively correlated with home age of neighborhood residences. Tree traits differed across neighborhoods of varying ages, suggesting different tree availability and preferences over time. Last, there was a positive correlation between resident preferences for tree attributes and the number of trees that had those attributes both in residential yards and in nursery offerings. Strong relationships between social variables and urban tree composition provides evidence that resident preferences and nursery offerings affect patterns of biodiversity in cities across Salt Lake Valley. These findings can be applied toward efforts to increase taxonomic and functional diversity of city trees in semiarid regions in ways that will also provide ecosystem services of most interest to residents.

AB Given concerns of increasing rates of species extinctions, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has become a major research focus over the past two decades. Many studies have shown that biodiversity per se (e.g. species richness) or species-specific traits may be good predictors of changes in ecosystem function. Although numerous studies on this subject have focused on terrestrial systems, few have evaluated benthic marine systems. We used the Limecola balthica community as a model to test whether the number or identity of three well-studied macrofaunal species influence the sediment bacterial compartment, which drives important biogeochemical processes and influence ecosystem functioning. We also investigated the poorly known role of meiofauna in the interactions between macrofauna and bacteria. Eight combinations of 0-3 species were maintained in microcosms for 34 days in the presence or absence of meiofauna. The abundance and composition of the bacterial community, defined by the relative percentage of cells with a high (HNA) vs low (LNA) nucleic acid content, were measured. Species identity of macrofauna was a better indicator of changes in the microbial compartment than was species richness per se. In particular, the gallery-diffuser behaviour of the polychaete Alitta Wrens likely induced strong changes in sediment physical and geochemical properties with a major impact on the bacterial compartment. Moreover, the presence of meiofauna modulated the influence of macrofauna on bacterial communities. This study provides evidence that species identity provides greater explanatory power than species richness to predict changes in the bacterial compartment. We propose that multi compartment approaches to describe interactions amongst different size classes of organisms and their ecological roles should be further developed to improve our understanding of benthic ecosystem functioning.

AB Competition can be fully hierarchical or intransitive, and this degree of hierarchy is driven by multiple factors, including environmental conditions, the functional traits of the species involved or the topology of competition networks. Studies simultaneously analysing these drivers of competition hierarchy are rare. Additionally, organisms compete either directly or via interference competition for resources or space, within a local neighbourhood or across the habitat. Therefore, the drivers of competition could change accordingly and depend on the taxa studied. We performed the first multi-taxon study on pairwise competition across major taxonomic groups, including experiments with vascular plants, mosses, saprobic fungi, aquatic protists and soil bacteria. We evaluated how general is competition intransitivity from the pairwise competition matrix including all species and also for each possible three-species combination (triplets). We then examined which species were likely to engage in competitive loops and the effects of environmental conditions, competitive rank and functional traits on intransitive competition. We found some degree of competition intransitivity in all taxa studied, with 38% to 5% of triplets being intransitive. Variance in competitive rank between species and more fertile conditions strongly reduced intransitivity, with triplets composed of species differing widely in their competitive ranks much less likely to be intransitive. Including functional traits of the species involved more than doubled the variation explained compared to models including competitive rank only. Both trait means and variance within triplets affected the odds of them being intransitive. However, the traits responsible and the direction of trait effects varied widely between taxa, suggesting that traits can have a wide variety of effects on competition.Synthesis. We evaluated the drivers of competition across multiple taxa and showed that productivity and competitive rank are fundamental drivers of intransitivity. We also showed that not only the functional traits of each species, but also those of the accompanying species, determine competition intransitivity. Intransitive competition is common across multiple taxa but can dampen under fertile conditions or for those species with large variance in their competitive abilities. This provides a first step towards predicting the prevalence of intransitive competition in natural communities.

AB 1. Invasive forest pathogens of the genus Phytophthora are threatening ecosystems globally. Phytophthora species are mainly introduced by humans importing infected nursery stock. However, due to the presence of environmental filters, not all introduced Phytophthoras manage to establish and spread. Phytophthoras' ability to overcome these filters may be linked to functional traits. In northern Europe, the increasing number of reports calls for a better understanding of the invasion process to prevent future outbreaks.
   2. We hypothesized that the incidence of invasive Phytophthoras in urban locations would be higher than in remote forests, that there would be a decrease of species richness along the invasion process because of environmental filtering, and that there would be a functional shift among Phytophthora communities between stages of invasion. We compared the species composition of 96 sites from 16 rivers running through areas that constitute a gradient of human influence. We also compared the species composition and functional diversity of Phytophthora communities in eight nurseries and 14 forests, including anthropogenic and natural forests. Phytophthoras were isolated from river water, soil and/or plant tissue. Cultures were identified based on the Internal Transcribed Spacer region.
   3. Three Phytophthoras were detected in all environments (Phytophthora cactorum, Phytophthora plurivora and Phytophthora cambivora). The incidence of these species was higher in urban locations than in remote forests, suggesting that human activities act as a driver of invasion. Most of the Phytophthoras detected in forests were detected in nurseries. The Phytophthora community in nurseries was richer and more diverse than in forests, pointing to environmental filtering affecting the establishment. Phytophthora communities in nurseries and forests differed in their functional divergence. Traits associated with establishment were the ability to form asexual survival structures and lower cardinal temperatures for growth.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings support the view that human activities act as drivers of Phytophthora invasions, and suggest that Phytophthoras able to form asexual structures are more likely to establish in northern Europe. The results increase the capacity to predict the establishment of Phytophthora species in Sweden and expand our understanding of the invasion process of forest pathogens.

AB Innovative approaches are needed to help understanding how species diversity is related to the latitudinal gradient at large or small scales. We have applied a novel approach, by combining morphological and biological traits, to assess the relative importance of the large scale latitudinal gradient and regional morphodynamic drivers in shaping the functional diversity of polychaete assemblages in shallow water habitats, from exposed to estuarine sandy beaches. We used literature data on polychaetes from beaches along the southern and southeastern Brazilian coast together with data on beach types, slope, grain size, temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a concentration. Generalized linear models on the FDis index for functional diversity calculated for each site and a combined RLQ and fourth-corner analysis were used to investigate relationships between functional traits and environmental variables. Functional diversity was not related to the latitudinal gradient but negatively correlated with grain size and beach slope. Functional diversity was highest in flat beaches with small grain size, little wave exposure and enhanced primary production, indicating that small scale morphodynamic conditions are the primary drivers of polychaete functional diversity.

AB Meiofauna play an important ecological role in benthic ecosystems. However, little is known about their small-scale (<1m(2)) distribution. Yet, this knowledge has both theoretical implications, by improving our understanding of how processes generate patterns; and practical outcomes by improving sampling designs. The goal of this study was to obtain insights into the small-scale distribution of meiofaunal invertebrates dwelling in the sediment of a lentic ecosystem (in this study, an artificial pond). We addressed this aim at coarse and fine taxonomical levels using meiofaunal groups and nematode species assemblages, respectively. For this purpose, 225 sediment samples were collected over a surface of 729cm(2) using a straw corer. Spatial patterns (dispersion index) and the typical patch sizes of the dominant meiofaunal groups were estimated using spatial autocorrelation analysis (Moran's I). We hypothesized that (1) we would find a patchy distribution of organisms with patch radii of a few centimetres, (2) the distribution of microbivorous meiofauna would follow that of OM, and (3) distribution would be patchier at the species level. The densities of the dominant meiobenthic groups (nematodes, gastrotrichs and rotifers) decreased with sediment depth. In all sediment layers, nematodes contributed 61%-82% to total invertebrate densities. Eleven nematode species were identified, with Eumonhystera filiformis (Bastian 1865) and Monhystera cf. paludicola de Man 1881 dominating the assemblage. All meiofaunal groups showed an aggregated distribution pattern (dispersion index >1). Spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed aggregations of nematodes in a patch radius of 3-8cm according to the different sediment layers. Rotifers were also patchy distributed but with smaller patch radius (3cm), whereas the respective distributions of gastrotrichs were less patchy. Therefore, our results mainly confirmed hypothesis (1). Our results provide the first insights into rotifer patch sizes. Also, these findings highlight the need for sampling designs better able to capture small-scale heterogeneities during larger-scale investigations. We ruled out the organic matter (OM) supply as an important driver of meiofaunal community structure as OM content did not correlate with the density of either meiofaunal groups or nematode species, and therefore arguing against hypothesis (2). Instead, the different distributions suggested responses to qualitative differences in resource availability, oxygen availability, biotic interactions and specific population-level processes, such as behaviour, dispersal and locomotion. Patchiness did not increase from coarse to fine taxonomic levels, thus contradicting hypothesis (3). Our results instead suggest that the patchiness of the spatial distribution was more closely linked to functional traits.

AB Long-term dynamics of phytoplankton have been addressed in marine and lake systems, but rarely in rivers. Large rivers, however, are highly human-impacted, whereas global warming may further affect the functioning of phytoplankton at long-term scale. In the middle section of the large European Danube River, long-term decrease in phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) and increase in species diversity have formerly been revealed. The functional community composition that relates to ecosystem functioning directly has not been addressed previously. We analyse a 34-year-long phytoplankton data set from the middle river section at God (N-Budapest), Hungary. We focus on gradual changes in the functional composition and functional diversity components based on the functional trait and functional group approaches. We hypothesised that long-term gradual changes in major environmental constraints should be followed by gradual shifts in dominance relationships among functional traits and functional groups of phytoplankton. We further hypothesised that functional shifts were highlighted by gradual changes in functional diversity components: evenness, divergence and dispersion. Water discharge of the middle Danube shifted towards the more frequent occurrence of lower values. On the other hand, high floods (>3,000m(3)/s) increased significantly with shortening tendency in duration and altered seasonality. The concentration of N and P forms, as well as total suspended solids decreased significantly. Water temperature increased significantly, especially in summer. In the phytoplankton, single-celled eutrophic centric diatoms decreased in relative abundance, but flagellated, elongated and filamentous forms increased. A clear functional shift was the dominance decrease in planktonic taxa and the relative abundance increase in benthic diatoms. All functional diversity components increased significantly in the entire data set, except functional evenness (FEVE) based on the functional group approach. At seasonal scale, all significant trends showed increases, except the FEVE components of the functional group approach, which decreased in winter and spring significantly. Long-term increase in functional diversity components alone could indicate enhanced ecosystem functioning of phytoplankton in the middle section of the Danube. However, we argue that the observed increase in functional diversity may be related to a gradual shift from high-biomass communities with the dominance of eutrophic centric diatoms towards the relative increase in several, but low-biomass elements. These include a few planktonic algae well adapted to the altered conditions, diatoms with benthic origin and dispersed limnophilic taxa. Our results provide the first evidence for a long-term phytoplankton functional regime shift in a European large river. Global warming, human impacts and oligotrophication might potentially increase the functional diversity of large river phytoplankton, but the origin and functional role of taxa should carefully be considered. The observed functional shift in phytoplankton might also be indicative for alterations in the food-web structure of the middle section of the Danube River at long-term scale.

AB Alterations of riparian areas of running waters resulted in fragmentation of the riverscape. The possible impact of climate change additionally stresses the importance for conservation planning for riparian habitats, especially for sessile plant species. The survival of species under changing habitat availability can be counteracted by ensuring functional connectivity of riparian plant species. This study applies a coupled modelling framework using species distribution models and dispersal simulations, which allow to analyze the potential future distribution of species in relation to their ecological niche, life history traits including dispersal abilities as well as barriers to dispersal such as dams. Modelled suitable habitats for six riparian plant species characteristic for the olive willow plant community (Salicion elaeagni) showed dramatic changes under the impact of two climate change scenarios. While habitat suitability remained low for species with a narrow ecological niche, it increased under climate change scenarios for species which are also found in secondary habitat outside riparian areas. Simulations of dispersal to the potential future habitat revealed nevertheless high numbers of decolonized cells after 80 years of dispersal for species with high future habitat suitability. This stresses the importance of a joint investigation of the habitat suitability under climate change scenarios, dispersal parameters as well as life history traits for conservation planning of riparian species. The simulated future distribution revealed that barriers along rivers have a significant negative effect on the spread of the studied plant species. Our results suggest that conservation management should focus on providing connected stepping stone habitats for riparian plant species along rivers, as current species occurrences are not persistent over time.

AB In ecosystems with high fish species endemicity, such as Mediterranean-type rivers, biogeographical differences among ecoregions present serious obstacles to developing broadly-applicable river bioassessment indices. This impediment has contributed to a serious time-lag in developing EU policy-relevant fish-based indices in the Eastern Mediterranean countries. Here we present the first model-based fish index for the Eastern Mediterranean (the Hellenic Fish Index, HeFI) in an effort to overcome biogeographic differences among the area's biotically heterogeneous rivers. The index is based on modelled reference conditions and employs site-specific electrofished fish samples from an extensive dataset from Greece that covers six freshwater ecoregions, including five transboundary river basins flowing through six countries. Environmental and anthropogenic pressure data were procured from 403 sampled river sites and ecologically-relevant traits were defined for 103 collected fish species. For the development of the index, we first diagnosed least degraded sites forming a calibrated reference site dataset and secondly quantified differences of fish metrics between the reference and impaired sites. Four trait-based fish metrics showed the best ability to discriminate between impaired and reference sites. The index performed well in discriminating anthropogenic pressure classes, giving a significant negative linear response to a gradient of anthropogenic degradation. HeFI successfully assessed both small and large rivers in different freshwater ecoregions. This geographically broad-scale index development shows that key trait-based reference conditions can be produced by a predictivemodel in remarkably heterogeneous rivers where range-restricted fishes dominate. This index promotes a screening-level bioassessment application that may be further developed and refined with relevant monitoring. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To address the fish use patterns of artificial structures mimicking floating macrophytes deployed in a impounded tributary of the Pearl River, China, field experiments were performed from December 2014 to June 2016 using multi-mesh gillnet. The fish assemblages using artificial structures differ in terms of species richness, abundance, body size, diversity indices, and ecological traits from fish assemblages on natural barren habitats of this river. Overall, fish abundance, species richness, Shannon diversity index, and functional richness were higher at the artificial structures than at the control sites, while fish length and functional evenness was greater at the control sites in comparison to artificial structures. The introduction of artificial structures did not result in statistically significant effects on fish biomass as artificial structures attracted more individuals with smaller size. Seasonal changes of chlorophyll-a and transparency may affect the efficiency of artificial structure in harboring fishes. This study revealed that artificial structures, as synthesized habitats, are effective in acting as a "fish attractor" and an alternative tool to provide new habitats for smaller individuals in a dammed river like the Youjiang River which is a structure-less ecosystem.

AB Long-term observations on riverine benthic invertebrate communities enable assessments of the potential impacts of global change on stream ecosystems. Besides increasing average temperatures, many studies predict greater temperature extremes and intense precipitation events as a consequence of climate change. In this study we examined long-term observation data (10-32 years) of 26 streams and rivers from four ecoregions in the European Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network, to investigate invertebrate community responses to changing climatic conditions. We used functional trait and multi-taxonomic analyses and combined examinations of general long-term changes in communities with detailed analyses of the impact of different climatic drivers (i.e., various temperature and precipitation variables) by focusing on the response of communities to climatic conditions of the previous year. Taxa and ecoregions differed substantially in their response to climate change conditions. We did not observe any trend of changes in total taxonomic richness or overall abundance over time or with increasing temperatures, which reflects a compensatory turnover in the composition of communities; sensitive Plecoptera decreased in response to warmer years and Ephemeroptera increased in northern regions. Invasive species increased with an increasing number of extreme days which also caused an apparent upstream community movement. The observed changes in functional feeding group diversity indicate that climate change may be associated with changes in trophic interactions within aquatic food webs. These findings highlight the vulnerability of riverine ecosystems to climate change and emphasize the need to further explore the interactive effects of climate change variables with other local stressors to develop appropriate conservation measures.

Environmental variables over multispatial scales and macroinvertebrate community data were collected on April (dry season) and September (wet season) of 2014 and 2015 at 19 sampling sites, of which nine had a high urbanization level (HUL), six had moderate urbanization level (MUL) and four had low urbanization level (LUL), in the Liangjiang New Area. The results of this study showed that macroinvertebrate assemblages significantly varied across the three urbanization levels. The sensitive species (e.g., EPT taxa) were mainly centralized at LUL sites, whereas tolerant species, such as Tubificidae (17.3%), Chironomidae (12.1%), and Physidae (4.61%), reached highest relative abundance at LUL sites. The values of family biotic index (FBI) and biological monitoring working party (BMWP) indicated the deterioration of water quality along urbanization gradient. Seasonal and inter -annual changes in macroinvertebrate communities were not observed. The results of variation partitioning analyses (CCAs) showed that habitat scale variables explained the major variation in macroinvertebrate community composition. Specifically, the increased nutrient concentrations favored tolerant species, whereas high water flow and substrate coarseness benefitted community taxa richness, diversity and EPT richness. Considering the interactions between scale-related processes, the results of this study suggested that urbanization resulted in less diverse and more tolerant stream macroinvertebrate assemblages mainly via increased nutrient concentrations and reduced substrate coarseness.

AB Background: A high-density genetic linkage map is essential for QTL fine mapping, comparative genome analysis, identification of candidate genes and marker-assisted selection for economic traits in aquaculture species. The Yangtze River common carp (Cyprinus carpio haematopterus) is one of the most important aquacultured strains in China. However, quite limited genetics and genomics resources have been developed for genetic improvement of economic traits in such strain.
   Results: A high-resolution genetic linkage map was constructed by using 7820 2b-RAD (2b-restriction site-associated DNA) and 295 microsatellite markers in a F2 family of the Yangtze River common carp (C. c. haematopterus). The length of the map was 4586.56 cM with an average marker interval of 0.57 cM. Comparative genome mapping revealed that a high proportion (70%) of markers with disagreed chromosome location was observed between C. c. haematopterus and another common carp strain (subspecies) C. c. carpio. A clear 2:1 relationship was observed between C. c. haematopterus linkage groups (LGs) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) chromosomes. Based on the genetic map, 21 QTLs for growth-related traits were detected on 12 LGs, and contributed values of phenotypic variance explained (PVE) ranging from 16.3 to 38.6%, with LOD scores ranging from 4.02 to 11.13. A genome-wide significant QTL (LOD = 10.83) and three chromosome-wide significant QTLs (mean LOD = 4.84) for sex were mapped on LG50 and LG24, respectively. A 1.4 cM confidence interval of QTL for all growth-related traits showed conserved synteny with a 2. 06 M segment on chromosome 14 of D. rerio. Five potential candidate genes were identified by blast search in this genomic region, including a well-studied multi-functional growth related gene, Apelin.
   Conclusions: We mapped a set of suggestive and significant QTLs for growth-related traits and sex based on a high-density genetic linkage map using SNP and microsatellite markers for Yangtze River common carp. Several candidate growth genes were also identified from the QTL regions by comparative mapping. This genetic map would provide a basis for genome assembly and comparative genomics studies, and those QTL-derived candidate genes and genetic markers are useful genomic resources for marker-assisted selection (MAS) of growth-related traits in the Yangtze River common carp.

AB Between May 2004 and May 2005. we sampled fish in 19 sites, grouped in four elevations, ranging from the river mouth to 650 m.a.s.l. in the Rio Pacuare, Caribbean versant of Costa Rica. Changes in the distribution and composition of the fish fauna, as well as patterns of alpha and beta diversity along an elevational gradient were assessed. Additional analyses of habitat preferences, trophic guilds, functional groups and general ecology for the most abundant species are included. All fish captured were classified into 22 families, 43 genera and 53 species. The most abundant family was Characidae, followed by Gobiidae, Mugilidae, Poeciliidae and Heptateridae, which together comprise 87.9 % of all sampled individuals. Elevation shows an inverse effect on species diversity, we observed a monotonic decrease in species richness with increasing elevation (p < 0.05), as reported in other tropical rivers. According to our results, in the Rio Pacuare the total fish fauna diversity is found within the first 500 m.a.s.l. Species turnover increases with elevation, while nestedness decreases. Turnover was dominated by the loss of species rather than gain; the higher species loss was registered between the river mouth and the lower river reach (< 100 m.a.s.l.). Seven species can be classified as typical or core species (Astyanax aeneus, Sicydium altum, Agonostomus monticola, Poecilia gillii, Brycon costaricensis, Rhamdia laticauda and Joturus pichardi) along the elevation gradient. The habitat availability and the integration of ecomorphological, feeding and reproductive traits help to explain better the elevation distribution of the complete set of species observed. Although it is possible to identify groups of species characteristic of each reach of river, this does not mean that they are isolated from each other. Natural drift and movement along the river of some species during their life cycle, especially S. altum, A. monticola and J. pichardi, are key processes linking the whole watershed. The present study constitutes a first step in documenting and understanding the distribution and composition of fish assemblages in a watershed that is relatively intact and well-conserved in the Caribbean versant of Costa Rica.

AB Vertical variations in trophic-functional patterns of biofilm-dwelling ciliates were studied in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China. A total of 50 species were identified and assigned to four trophic-functional groups (TFgrs): algivores (A), bacterivorous (B), non-selective (N) and raptors (R). The trophic-functional structures of the ciliate communities showed significant variability among different water depths: (1) with increasing water depth, relative species numbers and relative abundances of groups A and R decreased sharply whereas those of groups B and N increased gradually; (2) in terms of the frequency of occurrences, group A dominated at depths of 1-3.5 m whereas group B dominated at 5 m, while in terms of the probability density function of the trophic-functional spectrum, group A was the highest contributor at 1 m and group B was highest at the other three depths; (3) distance-based redundancy analyses revealed significant differences in trophic-functional patterns among the four depths, except between 2 and 3.5 m (P> 0.05); and (4) the trophic-functional trait diversity increased from 1 to 3.5 m and decreased sharply at S m. Our results suggest that the biofilm-dwelling dilates maintain a stable trophic-functional pattern and high biodiversity at depths of 1-3.5 m. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Marine organisms with planktonic life stages are subjected to extensive transport that results from the interactions between ocean currents and their behavioral responses to environmental changes in the course of their life. Questions remain on the identification of key drivers of dispersal and connectivity in marine populations as they can have multiple uses in the conservation and management of marine ecosystems. Here we investigate whether the open Kattegat, at the entrance to Baltic Sea, is the main source of recruitment to the benthos in associated estuaries and coastal sites through export of planktonic invertebrate larvae. We couple a 3D hydrodynamic ocean model (MIKE3FM) to an agent-based model and simulate the dispersal of macro-invertebrate populations in Danish waters. We use characteristic dispersal traits of the larval community (pelagic larval duration, spawning season, and settling behavior) and simulate dispersal processes within the muddy bottom habitats to derive recruitment rates and potential donor populations leading to population connectivity patterns on each site, one bay and two Danish fjords. We then use our recruitment results in the bay to compare them with field data on species diversity in the same area. A total of 48 different combinations of pelagic larval durations and spawning seasons of macro-invertebrates are simulated in two years 2004 and 2010. From these results, we conclude that the central and southern parts of the Danish waters are identified as important spawning grounds whereas the Kattegat does not seem to be the main provider of larvae into the selected sites. The model also predicts higher abundance and recruitment rates of macro-invertebrate larvae in 2010 compared to 2004. These results are supported by comparable species distribution data collected in the study area. Our results show the importance of an integrated modeling tool combining ocean circulation and biological traits to obtain a detailed description of dispersal and connectivity of macro-invertebrate community in the area, which can provide a more accurate baseline to manage marine biodiversity.

AB The reef flat is one of the largest and most distinctive habitats on coral reefs, yet its role in reef trophodynamics is poorly understood. Evolutionary evidence suggests that reef flat colonization by grazing fishes was a major innovation that permitted the exploitation of new space and trophic resources. However, the reef flat is hydrodynamically challenging, subject to high predation risks and covered with sediments that inhibit feeding by grazers. To explore these opposing influences, we examine the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) as a model system. We focus on grazing herbivores that directly access algal primary productivity in the epilithic algal matrix (EAM). By assessing abundance, biomass, and potential fish productivity, we explore the potential of the reef flat to support key ecosystem processes and its ability to maintain fisheries yields. On the GBR, the reef flat is, by far, the most important habitat for turf-grazing fishes, supporting an estimated 79% of individuals and 58% of the total biomass of grazing surgeonfishes, parrotfishes, and rabbitfishes. Approximately 59% of all (reef-wide) turf algal productivity is removed by reef flat grazers. The flat also supports approximately 75% of all grazer biomass growth. Our results highlight the evolutionary and ecological benefits of occupying shallow-water habitats (permitting a ninefold population increase). The acquisition of key locomotor and feeding traits has enabled fishes to access the trophic benefits of the reef flat, outweighing the costs imposed by water movement, predation, and sediments. Benthic assemblages on reefs in the future may increasingly resemble those seen on reef flats today, with low coral cover, limited topographic complexity, and extensive EAM. Reef flat grazing fishes may therefore play an increasingly important role in key ecosystem processes and in sustaining future fisheries yields.

AB The biodiversity and high productivity of coastal terrestrial and aquatic habitats are the foundation for important benefits to human societies around the world. These globally distributed habitats need frequent and broad systematic assessments, but field surveys only cover a small fraction of these areas. Satellite-based sensors can repeatedly record the visible and near-infrared reflectance spectra that contain the absorption, scattering, and fluorescence signatures of functional phytoplankton groups, colored dissolved matter, and particulate matter near the surface ocean, and of biologically structured habitats (floating and emergent vegetation, benthic habitats like coral, seagrass, and algae). These measures can be incorporated into Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), including the distribution, abundance, and traits of groups of species populations, and used to evaluate habitat fragmentation. However, current and planned satellites are not designed to observe the EBVs that change rapidly with extreme tides, salinity, temperatures, storms, pollution, or physical habitat destruction over scales relevant to human activity. Making these observations requires a new generation of satellite sensors able to sample with these combined characteristics: (1) spatial resolution on the order of 30 to 100-m pixels or smaller; (2) spectral resolution on the order of 5nm in the visible and 10nm in the short-wave infrared spectrum (or at least two or more bands at 1,030, 1,240, 1,630, 2,125, and/or 2,260nm) for atmospheric correction and aquatic and vegetation assessments; (3) radiometric quality with signal to noise ratios (SNR) above 800 (relative to signal levels typical of the open ocean), 14-bit digitization, absolute radiometric calibration <2%, relative calibration of 0.2%, polarization sensitivity <1%, high radiometric stability and linearity, and operations designed to minimize sunglint; and (4) temporal resolution of hours to days. We refer to these combined specifications as H4 imaging. Enabling H4 imaging is vital for the conservation and management of global biodiversity and ecosystem services, including food provisioning and water security. An agile satellite in a 3-d repeat low-Earth orbit could sample 30-km swath images of several hundred coastal habitats daily. Nine H4 satellites would provide weekly coverage of global coastal zones. Such satellite constellations are now feasible and are used in various applications.

AB Climatic warming will likely have idiosyncratic impacts on infectious diseases, causing some to increase while others decrease or shift geographically. A mechanistic framework could better predict these different temperature-disease outcomes. However, such a framework remains challenging to develop, due to the nonlinear and (sometimes) opposing thermal responses of different host and parasite traits and due to the difficulty of validating model predictions with observations and experiments. We address these challenges in a zooplankton-fungus (Daphnia dentifera-Metschnikowia bicuspidata) system. We test the hypothesis that warmer temperatures promote disease spread and produce larger epidemics. In lakes, epidemics that start earlier and warmer in autumn grow much larger. In a mesocosm experiment, warmer temperatures produced larger epidemics. A mechanistic model parameterized with trait assays revealed that this pattern arose primarily from the temperature dependence of transmission rate (), governed by the increasing foraging (and, hence, parasite exposure) rate of hosts (f). In the trait assays, parasite production seemed sufficiently responsive to shape epidemics as well; however, this trait proved too thermally insensitive in the mesocosm experiment and lake survey to matter much. Thus, in warmer environments, increased foraging of hosts raised transmission rate, yielding bigger epidemics through a potentially general, exposure-based mechanism for ectotherms. This mechanistic approach highlights how a trait-based framework will enhance predictive insight into responses of infectious disease to a warmer world.

AB In neotropical landscapes, a substantial fraction of the still waters available is found within tank bromeliads, plants which hold a few milliliters to several litres of rainwater within their leaf axils. The bromeliad ecosystem is integrated into the functioning of rainforest environments, but no study has ever estimated the secondary production, nor the biomass turnover rates of bromeliad macroinvertebrates in relation to other functional traits. We estimated secondary production at invertebrate population to metacommunity level in bromeliads of French Guiana. Coleoptera, Diptera and Crustacea with traits that confer resistance to drought had lower biomass turnover, longer generation times, and slower individual growth than species without particular resistance traits, suggesting convergent life history strategies in phylogenetically distant species. Detritivores and predators accounted for 87% and 13% of the overall annual production, respectively, but had similar production to biomass ratios. An average bromeliad sustained a production of 23.93 g dry mass m(-2) year(-1), a value which exceeds the medians of 5.0-14.8 g DM m(-2) year(-1) for lakes and rivers worldwide. Extrapolations to the total water volumes held by bromeliads at our field site yielded secondary production estimates of 226.8 +/- 32.5 g DM ha(-1) year(-1). We conclude that the ecological role of tank bromeliads in neotropical rainforests may be as important as that of other freshwater ecosystems.

AB Adult aquatic insects with a terrestrial life-stage are important vectors transferring resources assimilated in freshwater environments to terrestrial consumers. Research on this linkage has focused particularly on how terrestrial environmental features affect dispersal of adult aquatic insects, and on the responses of terrestrial consumers. However, both the timing and extent of dispersal by adult aquatic insects are further regulated by their species-specific life history traits. We sampled aquatic invertebrates from nine streams in central Sweden, and assessed how the composition of key traits related to dispersal and life history varied between in-stream habitats (riffles, pools), seasons (autumn, spring), and among streams differing in catchment land use (forested, agriculture). Traits indicative of more limited adult dispersal (e.g. small adult size and weak flying strength), along with traits indicative of strongly pulsed peaks in emergence (e.g. univoltinism and well-synchronised emergence) were all more abundant in the agricultural than forested streams in the autumn. However, these differences had disappeared by late spring, possibly reflecting early emergence by the univoltine taxa that dominated the agricultural stream communities and/or elevated mortality in the agricultural streams. Riffles supported higher abundances of insects with strongly flying adults, whereas traits associated with more limited dispersal were characteristic of insect assemblages in pools, which also supported the highest proportion of invertebrates completely lacking an adult flying stage. This result is likely to have implications at larger scales, given the dominance of soft-bottomed pool habitats and scarcity of riffles in many agricultural landscapes. Overall, our analysis indicates that while overall production of aquatic invertebrates with a winged adult was greater in agricultural streams, availability of this productivity for terrestrial consumers is more likely to be spatially restricted closer to the stream channel, and potentially also more temporally pulsed

AB The red king crab invaded Norwegian coastal waters in the early 1990s after having been introduced from the northern Pacific to the Russian Barents Sea coast. The crab stock increased rapidly in NE northern Norway in the latter half of the 1990s, and since 2002 there has been a commercial fishery in the eastern invaded areas. The crab is an active predator on benthic fauna especially feeding in deep soft-bottom environments. The present study is a follow-up of previous studies (2007-09) to assess the effects of the king crab predation on soft bottom species composition, ecological functioning and sediment quality. Macroinfauna (>1 mm) was investigated in three fjord areas in the Varanger region with low, moderate and very high crab abundances, respectively. Compared with data from 1994, most benthic species were markedly reduced in abundance, in particular non-moving burrowing and tube-dwelling polychaetes, bivalves and echinoderms. However, a few species appeared to recover from 2007-09 to 2012. Changes in ecological functioning were assessed using 'biological traits analysis (BTA)'. Following the crab invasion there was a relative reduction of suspension and surface deposit feeding species, an increase in mobile and predatory organisms and an increase in those with planktotrophic larval development. From low to high crab abundances functioning changed from tube-building, deep deposit feeding and fairly large size to free-living, shallow burrowing and rather small size. With regard to sediment reworking, downward and upward conveyors were reduced whereas surficial modifiers increased. The changes imply that sediment biomixing and bioirrigation were reduced leading to a degraded sedimentary environment. It is suggested that establishing relationships between ecosystem functioning and crab abundances may form the basis for estimating ecological costs of the crab invasion. Such knowledge is important for managing the crab in the Barents Sea area being both a non-indigenous species affecting native ecosystems as well as a valuable resource for commercial fishery.

AB The taxonomical structure and diversity of nematode assemblages are the main attributes analyzed in ecology, but nematode adaptations to their habitats are still understudied. Accordingly, a survey on some known and other newly proposed morpho-functional traits was carried out in order to: determine if the morpho-functional diversity of nematodes mirrors their taxonomical diversity; and assess potential nematode adaptations to sediment type and hydrodynamic stress. Morpho-functional traits were investigated both singularly and together and showed significant differences related to these environmental factors. The greatest taxonomical and morpho-functional diversity was found in medium-coarse sand (M-CS) and at an intermedium energy level (IEL). The M-CS and IEL were probably richer in micro-habitats and subject to a low selective pressure, hosting nematodes with a wide range of adaptations. The mirroring of morpho-functional diversity with taxonomical diversity is crucial for the future growth of the use of nematodes in biomonitoring. This is because the study of their morpho-functional traits could reduce the level of work involved and the costs of any analyses.

AB Leaf litter fuels secondary production in many aquatic ecosystems. Although the identity and species richness of leaf litter have been shown to influence ecosystem functioning and food-web composition, it has been challenging to relate such patterns to mechanisms based on litter traits. Here, we investigate how six different leaf litter species, and their mixture, affect litter decomposition, as well as the colonisation and survival of associated aquatic invertebrates in natural microecosystems (tank bromeliads). We then ask whether these effects of litter composition are explained by chemical and structural traits of the litter. Litter composition affected decomposition rates, assembly of aquatic macroinvertebrates in bromeliads and survival of some detritivores (e.g. Chironomidae). In general, most of this effect of litter composition was due to differences between litter species, not between single-species and six-species mixtures, and could be explained in terms of two dominant axes in litter traits. Decomposition was fastest in litters with high specific leaf area (SLA), N:P ratios and N and P contents, and slowest in litters with high lignin content and C:N ratios. Chironomid survival was also greatest on high N, N:P and SLA litters. Our results highlight the importance of considering leaf litter traits on the structure and functioning of freshwater ecosystems in future studies. More broadly, these results add to a growing consensus that functional traits of resource species, rather than the number of resource species, are essential to predicting resource-consumer interactions in food webs.

AB Trophic interactions are important determinants of the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Because the metabolism and consumption rates of ectotherms increase sharply with temperature, there are major concerns that global warming will increase the strength of trophic interactions, destabilizing food webs, and altering ecosystem structure and function. We used geothermally warmed streams that span an 11 degrees C temperature gradient to investigate the interplay between temperature-driven selection on traits related to metabolism and resource acquisition, and the interaction strength between the keystone gastropod grazer, Radix balthica, and a common algal resource. Populations from a warm stream (similar to 28 degrees C) had higher maximal metabolic rates and optimal temperatures than their counterparts from a cold stream (similar to 17 degrees C). We found that metabolic rates of the population originating from the warmer stream were higher across all measurement temperatures. A reciprocal transplant experiment demonstrated that the interaction strengths between the grazer and its algal resource were highest for both populations when transplanted into the warm stream. In line with the thermal dependence of respiration, interaction strengths involving grazers from the warm stream were always higher than those with grazers from the cold stream. These results imply that increases in metabolism and resource consumption mediated by the direct, thermodynamic effects of higher temperatures on physiological rates are not mitigated by metabolic compensation in the long term, and suggest that warming could increase the strength of algal-grazer interactions with likely knock-on effects for the biodiversity and productivity of aquatic ecosystems.

AB Bubble-plume mixing systems are often deployed in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs to manage phytoplankton taxa. Unfortunately, inconsistent outcomes from bubble-plume (induced) mixing are often reported in the literature. The present study investigates the response of phytoplankton to induced mixing using a whole-reservoir field experiment and a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (Si3D) coupled with the Aquatic EcoDynamics (AED) model through the framework for aquatic biogeochemical modelling (FABM). The coupled Si3D-AED model is validated against a 24-h field mixing experiment and subsequently used for a numerical parametric study to investigate phytoplankton responses to various induced mixing scenarios in which the phytoplankton settling rate, phytoplankton growth rate, reservoir depth, and mixing system diffuser depth were sequentially varied. Field observations during the mixing experiment suggest that the total phytoplankton concentration (measured in mu g/L) across the reservoir was reduced by nearly 10% during the 24-h mixing period. The numerical modeling results show that phytoplankton concentration may be substantially affected by the functional traits of the phytoplankton and the deployment depth of the mixing diffuser. Interestingly, the numerical results indicate that the phytoplankton concentration is controlled by reduced growth rates due to light limitation in deep reservoirs (> 20 m), whereas settling loss is a more important factor in shallow reservoirs during the mixing period. In addition, the coupled Si3D-AED model results suggest that deploying the mixing diffuser deeper in the water column to increase mixing depth may generally improve the successful management of cyanobacteria using bubble-plume mixing systems. Thus, the coupled Si3D-AED model introduced in the present study can assist with the design and operation of bubble-plume mixing systems.

AB Soil degradation affects agriculture worldwide. Soils with high salt can result from local geological conditions or accumulation of salt from irrigation. Salt limits water uptake and reduces crop yields; therefore, salt tolerance is an important trait for crops grown in high-salt soils. Here, we show that the rice (Oryza sativa) phytochrome B (osphyB) mutant has greater tolerance to salt stress than its parent japonica rice (cv. Dongjin). We found that the osphyB mutant showed a higher survival rate, fresh weight, and levels of total chlorophylls and carotenoids, as well as enhanced membrane integrity under salt stress compared to the wild type. OsPHYB transcripts increased in tissues of the wild type after salt treatment; OsPHYB expression was much higher in the leaf blade than in the stem and root. The osphyB mutant accumulated less Na+ in the shoot and considerably more K+ in both the shoot and root, maintaining a significantly lower Na+ to K+ ratio, possibly due to a lower rate of Na+ uptake and a higher rate of K+ uptake. To elucidate the possible mechanism of salt tolerance in the osphyB mutant, we performed quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis, which indicated that salt stress-associated genes, including transcription factors and high-affinity K+ transporters, are upregulated in the osphyB mutant under high-salinity conditions. Taken together, our findings show that the null mutation of OsPHYB contributes to a decrease in the Na+/K+ ratio and enhances cell membrane integrity through upregulation of salt stress-associated genes, resulting in improved tolerance to salt stress.

AB We present a phylogenetic analysis with divergence time estimates, and an ecomorphological assessment of the role of the benthic-to-pelagic axis of diversification in the history of haemulid fishes. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on 97 grunt species based on sequence data collected from seven loci. Divergence time estimation indicates that Haemulidae originated during the mid Eocene (54.7-42.3 Ma) but that the major lineages were formed during the mid-Oligocene 30-25 Ma. We propose a new classification that reflects the phylogenetic history of grunts. Overall the pattern of morphological and functional diversification in grunts appears to be strongly linked with feeding ecology. Feeding traits and the first principal component of body shape strongly separate species that feed in benthic and pelagic habitats. The benthic-to-pelagic axis has been the major axis of ecomorphological diversification in this important group of tropical shoreline fishes, with about 13 transitions between feeding habitats that have had major consequences for head and body morphology.

AB Monitoring of macroinvertebrate communities is frequently used to define the ecological health status of rivers. Ideally, biomonitoring should also give an indication on the major stressors acting on the macroinvertebrate communities supporting the selection of appropriate management measures. However, most indices are affected by more than one stressor. Biological traits (e.g. size, generation time, reproduction) could potentially lead to more stressor-specific indices. However, such an approach has rarely been tested.
   In this study we classify 324 macroinvertebrate taxa as vulnerable (decreasing abundances) or tolerant (increasing abundances) along 21 environmental gradients (i.e. nutrients, major ions, oxygen and micropollutants) from 422 monitoring sites in Germany using Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN). Subsequently, we investigate which biological traits and taxonomic groups are associated with taxa classified as vulnerable or tolerant with regard to specific gradients. The response of most taxa towards different gradients was similar and especially high for correlated gradients.
   Traits associated with vulnerable taxa across most gradients included: larval aquatic life stages, isolated cemented eggs, reproductive cycle per year <1, scrapers, aerial and aquatic active dispersal and plastron respiration. Traits associated with tolerant taxa included: adult aquatic life stages, polyvoltinism, ovoviviparity or egg clutches in vegetation, food preference for dead animals or living microinvertebrates, substrate preference for macrophytes, microphytes, silt or mud and a body size >2-4 cm.
   Our results question whether stressor-specific indices based on macroinvertebrate assemblages can be achieved using single traits, because we observed that similar taxa responded to different gradients and also similar traits were associated with vulnerable and tolerant taxa across a variety of water quality gradients. Future studies should examine whether combinations of traits focusing on specific taxonomic groups achieve higher stressor specificity. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Within riparian corridors, biotic-abiotic feedback mechanisms occur between woody vegetation strongly influenced by hydrogeomorphic constraints (e.g., sediment transport and deposition, shear stress, hydrological variability), fluvial landforms, and morphodynamics, which in turn are modulated by the established vegetation. During field investigations in spring 2015, we studied 16 alluvial bars (e.g., point and lateral bars) within the dynamic riparian corridor of the Allier River (France) to assess the aptitude of three pioneer riparian Salicaceae species (Populus nigra L, Salix purpurea L, and Salix alba L) to establish and act as ecosystem engineers by trapping sediment and constructing fluvial landforms. Our aim is to empirically identify the preferential establishment area (EA; i.e., the local areas where species become established) and the preferential biogeomorphic feedback window (BFW; i.e., where and to what extent the species and geomorphology interact) of these three species on alluvial bars within a 20-km-long river reach. Our results show that the EA and BFW of all three species vary significantly along the longitudinal profile, i.e., upstream-downstream exposure on the alluvial bars, as well as transversally, i.e., the main hydrological connectivity gradient from the river channel toward the floodplain. In the present-day context of the Allier River, P. nigra is the most abundant species, appearing to act as the main engineer species affecting landform dynamics at the bar scale; S. purpurea is established and acts as an ecosystem engineer at locations on alluvial bars that are most exposed to hydrosedimentary flow dynamics, while S. alba is established on the bar tail close to secondary channels and affects the geomorphology in mixed patches along with P. nigra. Our study highlights the role of functional trait diversity of riparian engineer species in controlling the extent of fluvial landform construction along geomorphic gradients within riparian corridors exposed to frequent hydrogeomorphic disturbances.

AB To predict the impact of pesticides in a warming world we need to know how species differ in the interaction pathways between pesticides and warming. Trait-based approaches have been successful in identifying the 'pace of life' and body size as predictors of sensitivity to pesticides among distantly related species. However, it remains to be tested whether these traits allow predicting differences in sensitivity to pesticides between closely related species, and in the strength of the interaction pathways between pesticides and warming. We tested the effects of multiple pulses of chlorpyrifos (allowing accumulation) under warming on key life history traits, heat tolerance (CTmax) and physiology of two congeneric damselfly species: the fast-paced (fast growth and development, high metabolic rate), small Ischnura pumilio and the slow-paced, large I. elegans. Chlorpyrifos reduced survival and growth, but contrary to current trait-based predictions I. pumilio was 8 x less sensitive than I. elegans. The lower sensitivity of I. pumilio could be explained by a higher fat content, and higher activities of acetylcholinesterase and of detoxifying and anti-oxidant enzymes. While for I. pumilio the effect of chlorpyrifos was small and did not depend on temperature, for I. elegans the impact was higher at 20 degrees C compared to 24 degrees C. This matches the higher pesticide accumulation in the water after multiple pulses at 20 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. The expected reduction in heat tolerance after pesticide exposure was present in I. elegans but not in I. pumilio. Our results demonstrate that closely related species can have very different sensitivities to a pesticide resulting in species-specific support for the "toxicant-induced climate change sensitivity" and the "climate-induced toxicant sensitivity" interaction pathways. Our results highlight that trait-based approaches can be strengthened by integrating physiological traits. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rivers and their floodplains have been severely degraded with increasing global activity and expenditure undertaken on restoration measures to address the degradation. Early restoration schemes focused on habitat creation with mixed ecological success. Part of the lack of ecological success can be attributed to the lack of effective monitoring. The current focus of river restoration practice is the restoration of physical processes and functioning of systems. The ecological assessment of restoration schemes may need to follow the same approach and consider whether schemes restore functional diversity in addition to taxonomic diversity. This paper examines whether two restoration schemes, on lowland UK rivers, restored macroinvertebrate taxonomic and functional ( trait) diversity and relates the findings to the Bradshaw's model of ecological restoration. The study schemes are considered a success in terms of restoring physical processes, longitudinal connectivity and the resulting habitat composition. However, the rehabilitation of macroinvertebrate community structure and function was limited and inconsistent, varying over time, depending on the restoration measure applied and the taxonomic or functional index considered. Resampling of species pools at each site revealed a role for functional redundancy, meaning that increases in functional diversity are more difficult to achieve than outcomes based on taxonomic analyses. Our results highlight the usefulness of applying functional traits alongside taxonomic indices in evaluating river restoration projects. Crown Copyright (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In mountain areas, the distribution of plant communities is affected by both regional and microhabitat conditions. The degree to which these different spatial factors contribute to plant communities is not well understood, because few studies have used a uniform sampling methodology to measure trait variation across the range of ecological scales. In this study, a stratified sampling method was used to study community weighted leaf traits and environment factors at different spatial (transect and plot) scales. We measured 6 leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf tissue density, leaf thickness, leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content) in 258 communities from 57 sites in 9 transects nested within 3 vegetation zones. These communities are located in the loess hilly and gully area of the Yanhe river watershed. We coupled climatic factors at the transect scale with topographic and edaphic factors at the plot scale using multilevel regression modeling to analyze the trait variation associated with spatial scales. At the transect scale, the mean annual rainfall showed a highly significant positive effect on the leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) (p < 0.01), while it had a highly significant negative effect on leaf thickness (LT) and leaf tissue density (LTD) (p < 0.001) and a significant negative effect on leaf carbon concentration (LCC) (p < 0.05), explaining 10.91%, 36.08%, 57.25% and 66.01% of LTD, LT, LCC and LNC variation at transect scale respectively. At a plot scale, the slope aspect showed a highly significant positive effect on specific leaf area (SLA) and LNC but a highly significant negative effect on LT and LTD. The soil water content had a significant negative effect on LT (p < 0.05) and LTD (p < 0.001) while soil organic matter showed a positive effect on SLA (p < 0.001) and LNC (p < 0.01). Totally, plot scale variables explained 7.28%, 43.60%, 46.43%, 75.39% and 81.17% of LCC, LT, LNC, LTD and SLA variation. The elevation showed positive effect only on LCC (p < 0.05). The results confirmed the existence of consistent trait-environment relationships at both transect and plot scales. These trait-environment relationships at different spatial scales will provide mechanistic understanding on the vegetation community assembly in the study area. Practically, ignoring trait variation within transects will underestimate roles of microhabitat filters in community assembly, and leads to the homogenization of restoration species. This will be like the past restoration plans and programs, causing serious environmental problems such as dwarf trees and soil desiccation.

AB Cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem function likely increase with elevation, thereby possibly placing alpine communities at greatest risk. Here, consideration of species traits enables stressor effects on taxonomic composition to be translated into potential functional impacts. We analyzed data for 47 taxa across 137 mountain lakes and ponds spanning large latitudinal (491 km) and elevational (1,399 m) gradients in western Canada, to assess regional and local factors of the taxonomic composition and functional structure of zooplankton communities. Multivariate community analyses revealed that small body size, clonal reproduction via parthenogenesis, and lack of pigmentation were species traits associated with both introduced non-native sportfish and also environmental conditions reflecting a warmer and drier climatenamely higher water temperatures, shallower water depths, and more chemically concentrated water. Thus, historical introductions of sportfish appear to have potentially induced greater tolerance in zooplankton communities of future climatic warming, especially in previously fishless alpine lakes. Although alpine lake communities occupied a relatively small functional space (i.e., low functional diversity), they were contained within the broader regional functional structure. Therefore, our findings point to the importance of dispersal by lower montane species to the future functional stability of alpine communities.

AB The functional diversity of phytoplankton communities was studied in two tropical estuaries subjected to anthropogenic pressure, despite one being environmentally protected. We applied functional diversity indices, analysed the dominant morphology traits and explored morphology-based functional groups. The less disturbed estuary showed slightly higher diversity and functional redundancy, during a wet season (on average 1.3 higher). Functional groups including nuisance species were more abundant in the heavily disturbed estuary. During a dry season, results for both systems were similar. Overall, abundance and functional diversity were higher in the upstream areas, associated with the river runoff containing freshwater species and essential nutrients for algae development. In both systems, diatoms were dominant (> 75% of the community), however, the group included small and larger individuals, and freshwater to cosmopolitan species. This dominance and the change in traits were associated with sufficient nutrient supply, low light conditions, ressuspension and salinity changes, also associated with river runoff. Overall, the different functional diversity approaches enabled us to improve our understanding of the changes occurring in both systems.

AB Ecological approaches, such as functional groups (sensu Reynolds, FG) and exclusively morphological-based groups (sensu Kruk, MBFG), have provided a reliable tool for understanding phytoplankton responses to environmental conditions. Our study evaluated the concordance and the response of these two-functional classifications of the phytoplankton community to environmental variables in reservoirs of different trophic states (ultra-oligotrophic to meso-eutrophic). We also investigated the spatial and temporal concordance of the functional classifications with the taxonomic-based classification (species). Integrated water samples were collected in the euphotic zone in two climatic periods (summer and winter) to determine physical and chemical variables and phytoplankton. Higher water temperature and thermal stratification were observed in the summer, whereas higher free CO2 concentrations and mixing regime of water column in the winter. The 35 descriptors species showed a greater relationship to the trophic conditions of the reservoirs. The functional classifications revealed that the 17 FGs and 7 MBFGs were influenced primarily by seasonal variation of limnological conditions (water temperature, CO2 concentration, Zmix depth) and secondarily by trophic state of the reservoirs. Stronger similarity (higher than 0.70) was verified between species and FGs matrices (Mantel test, mainly) than between species and MBFGs ones. Procrustes and Mantel tests also evidenced high concordance between FGs and MBFGs matrices, exhibiting similar spatial and temporal distribution to environmental conditions. Thus, these ecological classifications demonstrated to be complementary tools, besides their particular degrees of detailing, to elucidate the functional responses of numerous phytoplankton species in studied tropical reservoirs.

AB We applied essential fatty acids as a biomarker to experimentally test the effects of a fish-mediated trophic cascade on calanoid copepod nutritional state and functional traits in north-temperate freshwater ponds. A whole-pond experiment was conducted where young-of-the-year brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were introduced into three natural, fishless ponds with no previous history of fish introduction, and compared with four similar naturally fishless ponds. We unexpectedly found no effect of the fish-mediated trophic cascade on copepod population nutritional state and abundance, despite enhanced phytoplankton resources in fish-stocked ponds. While salmonids increased individual female copepod fecundity, the fish also reduced gravid copepod female abundance and altered copepod population sex ratios in favour of males. Fish predation likely influenced the overall nutritional state of calanoid copepod populations by expenditure of key lipids in male copepods through increased activity linked to female mate limitation, and selective predation on gravid female copepods. Therefore, the positive effects of the fish in enhancing the essential fatty acid content of phytoplankton communities via nutrient additions were not sufficient to over-ride the negative effects of fish predation on copepod population nutritional state and abundance.

AB We assessed the potential influence of hydrological connectivity among subdrainages on the structural and functional organization of stream macroinvertebrate metacommunities in 2 adjacent, large Asian watersheds (similar to 1.4 million km(2)). To examine the structural organization of metacommunities, we used multisite beta-diversity partitioning and applied the Elements of Metacommunity Structure (EMS) framework to resolve aspects of taxon associations and metacommunity assembly. We also decomposed functional diversity into nestedness and turnover to assess functional organization of metacommunities among watersheds of contrasting connectivity. To describe changes in functional composition, we used a multidimensional functional trait analysis to calculate the 3 primary components of functional diversity. The nestedness component of beta diversity had a higher contribution in the watershed displaying isolated subdrainages, and apparent lack of hydrological connectivity had a significant effect on the ecological fitting of macroinvertebrate metacommunities, generating a discrete composition of communities. Partitioning of functional b diversity suggested no difference among watersheds in metacommunity functional organization and a high level of functional redundancy among communities of subdrainages independent of hydrological isolation. These results show that hydrological connectivity is potentially an important driver structuring stream macroinvertebrate metacommunities at a macroecological scale. Patterns of metacommunity structure were expressed better using taxonomic than functional-trait diversity. In spite of a perceived functional redundancy, a wider functional space was observed in the absence of hydrological connectivity, a result suggesting discrete but partially overlapping functional entities associated with hydrological isolation in these watersheds.

AB Plant litter decomposition is an essential ecosystem function that contributes to carbon and nutrient cycling in streams. Aquatic shredders, mainly macroinvertebrates, can affect this process in various ways; they consume leaf litter, breaking it down into fragments and creating suitable habitats or resources for other organisms through the production of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM). However, measures of litter-feeding traits across a wide range of aquatic macroinvertebrates are still rare. Here, we assessed the contributions of 11 species of freshwater macroinvertebrates to litter decomposition, by measuring consumption rate, FPOM production, and assimilation rate of highly decomposable (Alnus glutinosa) or poorly decomposable (Quercus robur) leaf litter types. In general, an increase in the quality of litter improved the litter consumption rate, and fungal conditioning of the leaf litter increased both the litter consumption rate and FPOM production. Macroinvertebrates specializing in leaf litter consumption also appeared to be the most sensitive to shifts in litter quality and the conditioning process. Contrary to expectations, the conditioning process did not increase the assimilation of low-quality litter. There was a strong correlation between the relative consumption rate (RCR) of the two litter types, and the relative FPOM production (RFP) was strongly correlated to the RCR. These findings suggest a consistent relationship between RCR and macroinvertebrate identity that is not affected by litter quality, and that the RFP could be inferred from the RCR. The varying responses of the macroinvertebrate feeding traits to litter quality and the conditioning process suggest that the replacement of a shredder invertebrate species by another species could have major consequences for the decomposition process and the detritus-based food web in streams. Further studies onto the importance of invertebrate identity and the effects of litter quality in a variety of freshwater ecosystems are needed to understand the whole ecosystem functioning and to predict its response to environmental changes.

AB There has been increasing interest in algae-based bioassessment, particularly, trait-based approaches are increasingly suggested. However, the main drivers, especially the contribution of hydrological variables, of species composition, trait composition, and beta diversity of algae communities are less studied. To link species and trait composition to multiple factors (i.e., hydrological variables, local environmental variables, and spatial factors) that potentially control species occurrence/abundance and to determine their relative roles in shaping species composition, trait composition, and beta diversities of pelagic algae communities, samples were collected from a German lowland catchment, where a well-proven ecohydrological modeling enabled to predict long-term discharges at each sampling site. Both trait and species composition showed significant correlations with hydrological, environmental, and spatial variables, and variation partitioning revealed that the hydrological and local environmental variables outperformed spatial variables. A higher variation of trait composition (57.0%) than species composition (37.5%) could be explained by abiotic factors. Mantel tests showed that both species and trait-based beta diversities were mostly related to hydrological and environmental heterogeneity with hydrological contributing more than environmental variables, while purely spatial impact was less important. Our findings revealed the relative importance of hydrological variables in shaping pelagic algae community and their spatial patterns of beta diversities, emphasizing the need to include hydrological variables in long-term biomonitoring campaigns and biodiversity conservation or restoration. A key implication for biodiversity conservation was that maintaining the instream flow regime and keeping various habitats among rivers are of vital importance. However, further investigations at multispatial and temporal scales are greatly needed.

AB Although ecological restoration generally succeeds in increasing physical heterogeneity, many projects fail to enhance biota. Researchers have suggested several possible explanations, including insufficient restoration intensity, or time-lags in ecological responses that prevent detection of significant changes in short-term monitoring programs. This study aims to evaluate whether benthic macroinvertebrate communities responded to an expanded set of stream restoration measures within a study period of one to five years after completion of the restoration project. We studied 10 forest streams in northern Sweden that were channelized in the past for timber floating. Managers subjected six of these streams to habitat restoration, on each of these we selected two reaches, located in close proximity but differing in restoration intensity. In basic restored reaches, the restoration managers broke up the channelized banks and returned cobbles and small boulders to the main channel. In enhanced restoration reaches, they added additional large wood and boulders to reaches previously subjected to basic restoration, and rehabilitated gravel beds. The remaining four streams were not restored, and thus represent the baseline impacted (channelized) condition. We surveyed stream benthic assemblages before the enhanced restoration (year 2010) and three times afterward between 2011 and 2015. Five years after restoration, macroinvertebrate assemblages at the enhanced restored reaches were more differentiated from channelized conditions than those at basic-restored reaches. This reflected increased relative abundances of the insect orders Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera and the bivalve molluscs Sphaeriidae and decreased relative abundances of Chironomidae (Diptera). Analysis of functional traits provided further insights on the mechanistic explanations driving the recovery, e.g., indicating that the augmented channel retention capacity at enhanced restored reaches favored taxa adapted to slow flow conditions and more effectively retained passive aquatic dispersers. The increased restoration intensity in enhanced restored reaches has resulted in shifts in the composition of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, including increases in more sensitive taxa. These shifts became fully apparent five years after the enhanced restoration. Our results emphasize the value of longer-term monitoring to assess ecological responses following restoration, and of undertaking additional restoration as a valuable management option for previously restored sites that failed to achieve biotic recovery.

AB At the mouth of the Amazon River, a widespread carbonate ecosystem exists below the river plume, generating a hard-bottom reef (similar to 9500 km(2)) that includes mainly large sponges but also rhodolith beds. The mesozooplankton associated with the pelagic realm over the reef formation was characterized, considering the estuarine plume and oceanic influence. Vertical hauls were carried out using a standard plankton net with 200 mu m mesh size during September 2014. An indicator index was applied to express species importance as ecological indicators in community. Information on functional traits was gathered for the most abundant copepod species. Overall, 179 zooplankton taxa were recorded. Copepods were the richest (92 species), most diverse and most abundant group, whereas meroplankton were rare and less abundant. Species diversity (> 3.0 bits.ind(-1)) and evenness (> 0.6) were high, indicating a complex community. Small holoplanktonic species dominated the zooplankton, and the total density varied from 107.98 ind.m(-3) over the reef area to 2,609.24 ind.m(-3) in the estuarine plume, with a significant difference between coastal and oceanic areas. The most abundant copepods were the coastal species Oithona plumifera and Clausocalanus furcatus and early stages copepodites of Paracalanidae. The holoplanktonic Oikopleura, an important producer of mucous houses, was very abundant on the reefs. The indicator species index revealed three groups: (1) indicative of coastal waters under the influence of the estuarine plume [Euterpina acutifrons, Parvocalanus crassirostris, Oikopleura (Vexillaria) dioica and Hydromedusae]; (2) characterized coastal and oceanic conditions (Clausocalanus); (3) characterized the reef system (O. plumifera). Two major copepods functional groups were identified and sorted according to their trophic strategy and coastal-oceanic distribution. The species that dominated the coastal area and the area over the rhodolith beds are indicators of the estuarine plume and are mixed with species of the North Brazil Current. These species practically disappear offshore, where occur

AB Ecosystem services are the benefits that humans derive from ecosystems. Freshwater mussels perform many important functions in aquatic ecosystems, which can in turn be framed as the ecosystem services that they contribute to or provide. These include supporting services such as nutrient recycling and storage, structural habitat, substrate and food web modification, and use as environmental monitors; regulating services such as water purification (biofiltration); and provisioning and cultural services including use as a food source, as tools and jewelry, and for spiritual enhancement. Mussel-provided ecosystem services are declining because of large declines in mussel abundance. Mussel propagation could be used to restore populations of common mussel species and their ecosystem services. We need much more quantification of the economic, social, and ecological value and magnitude of ecosystem services provided by mussels, across species, habitats, and environmental conditions, and scaled up to whole watersheds. In addition, we need tools that will allow us to value mussel ecosystem services in a way that is understandable to both the public and to policy makers.

AB Determining how, when, and why energy allocation occurs based on different life history traits, provides core knowledge for understanding evolution, ecology, and conservation of populations. We assumed that, in seasonal environments, Anodontites trapesialis, a common freshwater mussel in the Pantanal wetland, has to time its maturation, its larvae incubation time, and adjusts its breeding strategy seasonally. From histological analyses of gametes, larval count, and marginal increment of the shell rings, we present information about phenology and growth strategies to investigate the influence of environment and reproductive period on growth. We determined for the first time, asymptotic maximum size and longevity for this mussel. This species is a functional hermaphrodite, with maturation and spawning starting at the end of the flood period, when the water begins to recede and fishes return to the main river channel. The larvae, lasidium in this case, disperse on host fishes at this time. As we predicted, the flood pulse is the main regulatory factor to the growth patterns and reproductive period establishment. The species' life history traits are discussed in the context of life history theory as adaptive responses to the dynamic balance imposed by the seasonality of the Pantanal.

AB The long-term impact of river regulation on fish functional diversity by a dam immediately upstream from the upper Parana River floodplain, Brazil, was evaluated. It was expected that the resulting alterations in natural flow, downstream from the dam, would negatively impact fish species, resulting in a functional simplification of the ichthyofauna. In addition, this effect was expected to be more pronounced in the directly affected main channel of the Parana River than in its tributaries, the Baia and Ivinhema rivers. Fish were sampled before (pre) and after (post) dam closure (the intervention). The functional traits used were diet, habitat use, mouth position, migration, parental care, internal fertilisation and maximum total length. Differences in trait composition between periods (pre and post) were tested using a PERMANOVA main-test. An indicator value analysis (IndVal) was applied to identify which traits significantly increased or decreased in abundance after the intervention. The indexes used were functional richness (FRic), Rao's quadratic entropy (FDQ) and functional redundancy (FRed). The intervention analysis based on linear models for time series was used to evaluate differences in these indexes over time. Traits most representative during pre-intervention were large-bodied species with long reproductive migrations, pelagic, with subterminal and superior mouths, and herbivorous. Traits most representative during the post-intervention were omnivorous species, with parental care, benthopelagic and insectivorous, which typically characterise fishes that inhabit stable environments. FRic decreased in Parana and Baia rivers after the construction of the dam. However, the Ivinhema River showed an increase in mean FRic in the post-intervention period. FDQ decreased substantially in all three rivers, while FRed increased. The combined results of FRic, FDQ and FRed corroborate the functional simplification hypothesis expected from flow regulation by dams on functional diversity. As expected, the most pronounced simplification occurred in the Parana River. Therefore, hydroelectric power plants can act as environmental filters strongly selecting functional traits of the downstream fish fauna, generating long-lasting impacts on ecosystem functioning and services.

AB Seagrasses and aquatic plants are important clades of higher plants, significant for carbon sequestration and marine ecological restoration. They are valuable in the sense that they allow us to understand how plants have developed traits to adapt to high salinity and photosynthetically challenged environments. Here, we present a large-scale phylogenetically profiled transcriptomics repository covering seagrasses and aquatic plants. SeagrassDB encompasses a total of 1,052,262 unigenes with a minimum and maximum contig length of 8,831 bp and 16,705 bp respectively. SeagrassDB provides access to 34,455 transcription factors, 470,568 PFAM domains, 382,528 prosite models and 482,121 InterPro domains across 9 species. SeagrassDB allows for the comparative gene mining using BLAST-based approaches and subsequent unigenes sequence retrieval with associated features such as expression (FPKM values), gene ontologies, functional assignments, family level classification, Interpro domains, KEGG orthology (KO), transcription factors and prosite information. SeagrassDB is available to the scientific community for exploring the functional genic landscape of seagrass and aquatic plants at: http://115.146.91.129/index.php.

AB Phenotypic differences between closely related taxa or populations can arise through genetic variation or be environmentally induced, leading to altered transcription of genes during development. Comparative developmental studies of closely related species or variable populations within species can help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms related to evolutionary divergence and speciation. Studies of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and related salmonids have revealed considerable phenotypic variation among populations and in Arctic charr many cases of extensive variation within lakes (resource polymorphism) have been recorded. One example is the four Arctic charr morphs in the similar to 10,000 year old Lake Thingvallavatn, which differ in numerous morphological and life history traits. We set out to investigate the molecular and developmental roots of this polymorphism by studying gene expression in embryos of three of the morphs reared in a common garden set-up. We performed RNA-sequencing, de-novo transcriptome assembly and compared gene expression among morphs during an important timeframe in early development, i.e., preceding the formation of key trophic structures. Expectedly, developmental time was the predominant explanatory variable. As the data were affected by some form of RNA-degradation even though all samples passed quality control testing, an estimate of 3'-bias was the second most common explanatory variable. Importantly, morph, both as an independent variable and as interaction with developmental time, affected the expression of numerous transcripts. Transcripts with morph effect, separated the three morphs at the expression level, with the two benthic morphs being more similar. However, Gene Ontology analyses did not reveal clear functional enrichment of transcripts between groups. Verification via qPCR confirmed differential expression of several genes between the morphs, including regulatory genes such as AT-Rich Interaction Domain 4A (arid4a) and translin (tsn). The data are consistent with a scenario where genetic divergence has contributed to differential expression of multiple genes and systems during early development of these sympatric Arctic charr morphs.

AB The biological traits of the sixty-eight most widespread multicellular non-indigenous species (MWNIS) in European Seas: Baltic Sea, Western European Margin of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea were examined. Data for nine biological traits was analyzed, and a total of 41 separate categories were used to describe the biological and ecological functions of these NIS.
   Our findings show that high dispersal ability, high reproductive rate and ecological generalization are the biological traits commonly associated with MWNIS. The functional groups that describe most of the 68 MWNIS are: photoautotrophic, zoobenthic (both sessile and motile) and nektonic predatory species. However, these 'most widespread' species comprise a wide range of taxa and biological trait profiles; thereby a clear "identikit of a perfect invader" for marine and brackish environments is difficult to define. Some traits, for example: "life form", "feeding method" and "mobility", feature multiple behaviours and strategies. Even species introduced by a single pathway, e.g. vessels, feature diverse biological trait profiles.
   MWNIS likely to impact community organization, structure and diversity are often associated with brackish environments. For many traits ("life form", "sociability", "reproductive type", "reproductive frequency", "haploid and diploid dispersal" and "mobility"), the categories mostly expressed by the impact-causing MWNIS do not differ substantially from the whole set of MWNIS.

AB European freshwater habitats have experienced a severe loss of plant diversity, regionally and locally, over the last century or more. One important and well-established driver of change is eutrophication, which has increased with rising population density and agricultural intensification. However, reduced disturbance of lake margins may have played an additional key role. The geographical variation in water chemistry, which has set the scene for-and interacted with-anthropogenic impact, is much less well understood. We took advantage of some recently completed regional plant distribution surveys, relying on hundreds of skilled citizen scientists, and analyzed the hydrophyte richness to environment relations in five contiguous South-Scandinavian regions. For three of the regions, we also assessed changes to the freshwater flora over the latest 50-80 years. We found a considerable variation in background total phosphorus concentrations and alkalinity, both within and between regions. The prevalence of functional groups differed between regions in accordance with the environmental conditions and the species' tolerance to turbid waters. Similarly, the historical changes within regions followed the same trend in correspondence to the altered environmental conditions over time. Small submerged species decreased relative to tall submerged and floating-leaved species along the regional and historical eutrophication gradients. These changes were accompanied by systematically greater relative abundance of species of higher phosphorus prevalence. We conclude that species traits in close correspondence with anthropogenic impacts are the main determinants of local, regional and historical changes of species distribution and occupancy, while pure biogeography plays a minor role. Conservation measures, such as re-oligotrophication and re-established disturbance regimes through grazing and water level fluctuations, may help reduce the tall reed vegetation, restore the former richness of the freshwater flora and safeguard red-listed species, although extended time delays are anticipated in nutrient-rich regions, in which species only survive at minute abundance in isolated refugia.

AB In response to the need to assess the ecological quality or health of marine benthic habitats, there has been a proliferation of biotic indices based on soft sediment macrofaunal communities. While shown to be useful in areas where they have been developed, some indices may not be readily transferrable to other regions due to differences in species ecology or composition, stressor type or magnitude, and natural variability. Using a national New Zealand dataset compiled from estuary monitoring data for 2001-2016, we used linear mixed models to determine the effect of multiple stressors (sediment mud content, metals and total phosphorus) and natural variability (associated with space, estuary type and time) on nine indices developed in New Zealand and overseas. The Richness-Integrated AZTI Marine Biotic Index (RI-AMBI), a modification of a popular overseas biotic index, had the most variation explained by stressors overall (marginal pseudo-R-2 = 0.22 compared to <= 0.15 for all other indices). This variation was primarily explained by a single stressor, sediment mud content, which is the dominant stressor in New Zealand estuaries. However, although the overall variation explained by stressors was lower for all other indices, multiple, rather than single, stressors had significant effects on some indices. For example all three stressors had a significant effect on the Traits Based Index, and the variation explained by metals was highest for this index. Relatively high amounts of natural and unexplained variation for all indices suggested that further understanding is required before operational implementation of indices at a national scale. Thus, the use of more than one index, i.e. a weight of evidence approach, is suggested to minimise uncertainty related to inaccuracy and misclassification of ecological health in New Zealand estuaries.

AB Sponges (phylum Porifera) traditionally are represented as inactive, sessile filter-feeding animals devoid of any behavior except filtering activity. However, different time-lapse techniques demonstrate that sponges are able to show a wide range of coordinated but slow whole-organism behavior. The present study concerns a peculiar type of such behavior in the psychrophilic demosponge Amphilectus lobatus: stolonial movement. During stolonial movement, sponges produce outgrowths (stolons) that crawl along a substrate with a speed of 4.4 +/- 2.2 mu m min(-1) and branch, thus forming a complex net covering a considerable area of a substrate. This net is used by sponges to search for new points with appropriate environmental conditions for individual relocation. After such points are found, all cells of the parental sponge migrate through stolons, leaving a naked parental skeleton, forming one or several filial sponges in the new location. Thus, stolonial movement combines traits of crawling along the substrate and asexual reproduction. This behavior relies on massive cell dedifferentiation followed by coordinated cell migration to the point of new sponge body formation and their subsequent differentiation into specialized cell types.

AB Cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras) comprise a highly diversified group of basal vertebrates occupying a plethora of ecological aquatic niches. They represent critical components of marine ecosystems and food webs, although numerous species are threatened and almost half are poorly known. Genomic resources emerging from this basal jawed vertebrate group have offered valuable insights into the evolution of vertebrate specific traits. Yet, the taxon remains largely understudied. Here, we generated the first high-quality de novo assembly of kidney and spleen transcriptomes of the blue shark (Prionace glauca). A total of 32,917,412 and 52,666,542 reads were obtained for spleen and kidney, respectively, using RNA-Seq Illumina technology. De novo multi-tissue assembly resulted in 97,317 unigenes with an N50 of 1975 bp, in which 87,571 were assigned to a particular tissue or combination of tissues based on the sequencing read mapping. Functional annotation generated 28,564 and 19,854 open reading frames in spleen and kidney, respectively. This dataset provides a significant resource for physiological and evolutionary studies, namely into the unique osmoregulatory system of Chondrichthyes and the evolution of the immune system in vertebrates.

AB Researches on the functional diversity of benthic ecosystems have mainly focused on macrofauna, and studies on functional structure of ciliate communities have been based only on trophic- or size-groups. Current research was carried out on the changing patterns of classical and functional diversity of benthic ciliates in response to environmental gradients at three sites in a wetland in Yangtze Estuary. The results showed that changes of environmental factors (e.g. salinity, sediment grain size and hydrodynamic conditions) in the Yangtze Estuary induce variability in species composition and functional trait distribution. Furthermore, increased species richness and diversity did not lead to significant changes in functional diversity due to functional redundancy. However, salt water intrusion of Yangtze Estuary during the dry season could cause reduced functional diversity of ciliate communities. Current study provides the first insight into the functional diversity of ciliate communities in response to environmental gradients.

AB Functional-based approaches are increasingly being used to define the functional diversity of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we proposed the use of delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes as a proxy of zooplankton functional traits in Lake Maggiore, a large, deep subalpine Italian lake. We analyzed the seasonal pattern of delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of different crustacean zooplankton taxa to determine food sources, preferred habitats, and trophic positions of species throughout one year. The cladocerans Daphnia longispina galeata gr., Diaphanosoma brachyurum, and Eubosmina longispina were grouped into a primary consumer functional group from their delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic signatures, but while the former two species shared the same food sources, the latter exhibited a more selective feeding strategy. Cyclopoid copepods occupied a distinct functional group from the other secondary consumers, being the most N-15 enriched group in the lake. The delta N-15 signature of calanoid copepods showed trophic enrichment in comparison to Daphnia and Eubosmina and linear mixing model results confirmed a predator-prey relationship. In our study, we have demonstrated that the use of delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes represented an effective tool to define ecological roles of freshwater zooplankton species and to determine functional diversity in a lake.

AB Global change threatens invertebrate biodiversity and its central role in numerous ecosystem functions and services. Functional trait analyses have been advocated to uncover global mechanisms behind biodiversity responses to environmental change, but the application of this approach for invertebrates is underdeveloped relative to other organism groups. From an evaluation of 363 records comprising >1.23 million invertebrates collected from rivers across nine biogeographic regions on three continents, consistent responses of community trait composition and diversity to replicated gradients of reduced glacier cover are demonstrated. After accounting for a systematic regional effect of latitude, the processes shaping river invertebrate functional diversity are globally consistent. Analyses nested within individual regions identified an increase in functional diversity as glacier cover decreases. Community assembly models demonstrated that dispersal limitation was the dominant process underlying these patterns, although environmental filtering was also evident in highly glacierized basins. These findings indicate that predictable mechanisms govern river invertebrate community responses to decreasing glacier cover globally.

AB Dispersal, abiotic and biotic constraints are all involved in explaining the success of invasive plants but how these factors influence the different life stages of an invader remains poorly known. Focusing on highly invaded riparian habitats we asked: (1) how do propagule pressure, resource availability and resident vegetation influence the success of the invasive Asian vine Humulus japonicus at different stages of its life cycle (i.e. seedling, vegetative and flowering) (2) what is the influence of increasing resource availability on the performance and trait plasticity of H. japonicus compared to a functionally similar co-occurring native species? To answer the first question we performed a repeated field survey along the Gardon River (S France) with detailed measurements of distance to the riverbed, soil characteristics, light availability, and resident vegetation cover. To answer the second question we used a greenhouse experiment to compare the biomass and three functional traits of H. japonicus and Galium aparine along a gradient of increasing water and nitrogen availability. Initial germination success was only determined by abiotic constraints, while the role of biotic resistance increased for later stages with establishment success favoured by the interaction of low resident vegetation cover and high soil fertility, and final integrated success favoured by high light availability. H. japonicus performed better and showed higher plasticity in plant height than G. aparine under increased resource availability while their biomass did not differ in the lower part of the resource gradient. Our study demonstrates that by combining field and experimental studies and analysing responses at different life stages we can gain a more complete understanding of how ecological filters shape successful invasions in the course of the life cycle.

AB Dietary partitioning often accompanies the increased morphological diversity seen during adaptive radiations within aquatic systems. While such niche partitioning would be expected in older radiations, it is unclear how significant morphological divergence occurs within a shorter time period. Here we show how differential growth in key elements of the feeding mechanism can bring about pronounced functional differences among closely related species. An incredibly young adaptive radiation of three Cyprinodon species residing within hypersaline lakes in San Salvador Island, Bahamas, has recently been described. Characterized by distinct head shapes, gut content analyses revealed three discrete feeding modes in these species: basal detritivory as well as derived durophagy and lepidophagy (scale-feeding). We dissected, cleared and stained, and micro-CT scanned species to assess functionally relevant differences in craniofacial musculoskeletal elements. The widespread feeding mode previously described for cyprinodontiforms, in which the force of the bite may be secondary to the requisite dexterity needed to pick at food items, is modified within both the scale specialist and the durophagous species. While the scale specialist has greatly emphasized maxillary retraction, using it to overcome the poor mechanical advantage associated with scaleeating, the durophage has instead stabilized the maxilla. In all species the bulk of the adductor musculature is composed of AM A1. However, the combined masses of both adductor mandibulae (AM) A1 and A3 in the scale specialist were five times that of the other species, showing the importance of growth in functional divergence. The scale specialist combines plesiomorphic jaw mechanisms with both a hypertrophied AM A1 and a slightly modified maxillary anatomy (with substantial functional implications) to generate a bite that is both strong and allows a wide range of motion in the upper jaw, two attributes that normally tradeoff mechanically. Thus, a significant feeding innovation (scale-eating, rarely seen in fishes) may evolve based largely on allometric changes in ancestral structures. Alternatively, the durophage shows reduced growth with foreshortened jaws that are stabilized by an immobile maxilla. Overall, scale specialists showed the most divergent morphology, suggesting that selection for scale-biting might be stronger or act on a greater number of traits than selection for either detritivory or durophagy. The scale specialist has colonized an adaptive peak that few lineages have climbed. Thus, heterochronic changes in growth can quickly produce functionally relevant change among closely related species.

AB Trace metal risk assessment and environmental quality standard definition require realistic models that quantify metal exposure and accumulation by biota. In the present study we propose a novel trait-based approach to predict whole body concentrations of metals in aquatic invertebrates from concentrations measured in different environmental compartments. Field data from a large riverine floodplain was used to calibrate and test the model. The prediction performance of the trait-based model was unbiased and uncertainty was below the twofold of measured concentrations for the four studied metals (Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb). The relative contribution of feeding, respiration and locomotion patterns as well as metal concentrations in three environmental compartments provided insights into the importance of different uptake pathways. The relation with the sediment (i.e., to what degree taxa live in or directly on the sediment) was shown to be the most important trait to predict metal accumulation. Overall, this study demonstrated the potential use of bioecological traits for the modeling of whole body metal concentrations of entire aquatic invertebrate communities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Benthic nematodes are recognized as suitable organisms to provide valuable information on the potential ecological effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances in aquatic ecosystems. The biomass and morphometric attributes of nematodes (body length, width, and length/width) collected in the Mira estuary (SW Portugal) were analysed before the collapse and during the natural recovery process of the Zostera noltii bed. In addition, their relationship with community characteristics and environmental variables was studied. Moreover, biomass and morphometric attributes were investigated for their potential use as a complementary tool to the classical descriptor "density" (from which several other descriptors are derived) when studying nematodes as biological indicators. Nematode biomass and morphometric attributes proved to be valuable as correlate with the environmental changes associated with the Z. noltii collapse. High values of nematode biomass, length, width, and length/width ratio were observed during the early recovery process of Z. noltii, contrasting with nematode densities, which showed consistently higher values before the collapse. These findings suggest that biomass and morphometric attributes indicate a functional adaptation of nematode communities to the new environmental conditions in the early recovery process of Z. noltii. Therefore, these traits may be used to provide complementary information to standing stocks of nematode assemblages so as to assess ecological changes over spatial and temporal scales in marine ecosystems, particularly within seagrass bed habitats.

AB The abandoned Aldermac Mine in Quebec, Canada, has been a source of acid mine drainage to Lake Arnoux since 1946. Restoration of the site was undertaken in 2008 and completed in 2010. We compared lakewater chemistry and benthic invertebrate communities in the spring of 2010, prior to complete restoration, and in spring 2011, when acid mine drainage was no longer entering the lake. Between these years, lakewater pH increased by about one unit and the concentrations of many trace metals declined substantially. In 2010, benthic taxonomic richness increased significantly with distance from the source of contamination, whereas after restoration, there was no longer a clear trend. Communities in highly contaminated stations tended to be dominated by burrowing taxa such as larvae of Chironomus (Chironomidae) and Oligochaeta, whereas less contaminated stations had taxonomic and functional communities that were more diverse. In the year following recovery, some new taxa appeared (Trichoptera, Odonata, and the Ceratopogonidae Bezzia), whereas the populations of an acid-tolerant Chironomus species declined. However, only larger individuals exhibited a significant response to pH and metal contamination.

AB Calls for evaluating general principles in landscape genetics reflect a broader recognition that multispecies inference is a promising strategy for supporting conservation actions across wide-ranging taxonomies and geographies. Formal evaluation of frameworks for multispecies inference is critical to identify opportunities for generalization and to avoid misguided extrapolation that results in ineffective conservation and management efforts. Traits-based approaches are now widely recognized as useful in addressing knowledge gaps where species-specific data may not be available or feasible to obtain. Here we present a case for the application of traits-based approaches in landscape genetics to improve conservation application. We discuss the fundamental theoretical framework and growing empirical evidence supporting the utility of traits-based approaches in landscape genetics, and we highlight an example of the implementation of traits to predict landscape genetic relationships for a range of aquatic taxa native to the southwestern United States. Finally, we discuss opportunities, challenges, and future directions of using traits to characterize landscape genetic relationships. Ultimately, traits-based approaches can help address growing calls for the development and testing of general principles in landscape genetics in order to improve application to conservation challenges.

AB Understanding how microbial diversity influences ecosystem properties is of paramount importance. Cellular traits-which determine responses to the abiotic and biotic environment-may help us rigorously link them. However, our capacity to measure traits in natural communities has thus far been limited. Here we compared the predictive power of trait richness (trait space coverage), evenness (regularity in trait distribution) and divergence (prevalence of extreme phenotypes) derived from individual-based measurements with two species-level metrics (taxonomic richness and evenness) when modelling the productivity of natural phytoplankton communities. Using phytoplankton data obtained from 28 lakes sampled at different spatial and temporal scales, we found that the diversity in individual-level morphophysiological traits strongly improved our ability to predict community resource-use and biomass yield. Trait evenness-the regularity in distribution of individual cells/colonies within the trait space-was the strongest predictor, exhibiting a robust negative relationship across scales. Our study suggests that quantifying individual microbial phenotypes in trait space may help us understand how to link physiology to ecosystem-scale processes. Elucidating the mechanisms scaling individual-level trait variation to microbial community dynamics could there improve our ability to forecast changes in ecosystem properties across environmental gradients.

AB Different bacterial groups in irrigation well water are strongly implicated in soil health and plant development. Herein, 48 bacterial strains were isolated from agricultural well water in northern Algeria. Among them, four strains were selected based on their antifungal potential and their ability to express Plant Growth Promoting traits such as Indole Acetic Acid (IAA), hydrolytic enzymes, siderophores etc. The isolates were identified as Pseudomonas sp. (B, D and N strains) and Serratia sp. (C strain) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Mycelial growth inhibition against Botrytis cinerea and Aspergillus niger ranged from 60 to 90% for the four strains. Moreover, volatiles compounds emission by the isolates resulted in Plant Growth Inhibition values ranging from 13 to 50%, specifically against B. cinerea. Impressively, the strains' antifungal activity showed high inducibility as it was obtained only by the filtered supernatants from bacterial cultures previously in contact with the fungus. Finally, a greenhouse assay, carried out to determine the strains' efficacy in promoting plant growth and protecting seedlings under Pythium aphanidermatum-infected soil, revealed that the strain N markedly enhanced pea germination (+ 250%) and fresh weight (+ 43%) and tomato fresh weigh (+ 10%). The results constitute an attempt for better use of the bacterial functional diversity from irrigation wells in sustainable agriculture.

AB Recent studies clearly support a positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship in phytoplankton. As taxon richness does not quantify functional diversity, functional approaches have been developed to link community functioning to diversity. Compared to terrestrial plant communities, only a few studies have validated phytoplankton functional approaches in BEF relationships. Furthermore, the ability of functional and taxonomic richness measures in predicting ecosystem functioning of natural phytoplankton communities has not been compared yet. Here, we analysed the BEF relationship using taxonomic and functional (trait categories and response groups sensu Reynolds) approaches in a broad-scale phytoplankton dataset from Fennoscandia. First, we analysed how taxonomic and functional compositions were related to local environmental predictors. We then compared how taxonomic and functional richness performed in predicting resource-use efficiency (the yield in phytoplankton biomass standardised by total phosphorus) as an ecosystem functioning measure. Finally, we tested whether the relationship between ecosystem functioning and taxonomic richness is further enhanced once each of the functional richness measure is also considered. Among the approaches, phytoplankton functional trait categories as community matrix showed the best correspondence with the local environment. The richness of phytoplankton response groups predicted ecosystem functioning significantly better than the taxonomic and the functional trait category richnessboth in the full dataset and in almost all Fennoscandian countries. On top of taxonomic richness, only the residual variation in response group richness predicted ecosystem functioning positively in the entire dataset and in all individual countries. Applying functional approaches, reduced complexity of data should come along with reduced ecological information. We showed, however, that both functional approaches represented some functional redundancy among taxa in a meaningful way, and enhanced our ability in predicting community composition from environmental predictors. Moreover, phytoplankton response group richness sensu Reynolds summarises information on ecosystem functioning contained in the taxonomic data in a way that represents functional diversity better than the richness of functional trait categories. Interestingly, the response group approach, which is exclusively derived from field observations rather than from quantified phytoplankton traits, outperforms taxonomic richness and trait category richness in predicting ecosystem functioning in our dataset. This may highlight that our ability to quantify phytoplankton traits is still limited. Existing phytoplankton functional approaches, however, can translate the taxonomic information into a reduced but reliable functional matrix already and predict ecosystem functioning better than taxonomic data.

AB Riverbank erosion is linked to increasing risks in piedmont areas due to urbanization and hydromorphological alterations of rivers. Changes in riparian vegetation and in sediment dynamics modify aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. In this context, riverbank stabilization is a major issue in the conservation of stream ecosystem functioning. In this study, we aimed at assessing the impacts of riverbank stabilization techniques on the taxonomic and functional properties of benthic macroinvertebrate communities living in alpine mountain streams. For this purpose, the effects of four riverbank stabilization techniques (riprap, mixed, cribwall, and fascine) on the taxonomic richness and biological traits involved in the main ecological processes were tested and compared with natural bank conditions. Overall, the macroinvertebrate richness was lower in stabilized banks than in natural conditions, and communities welcomed on natural banks were significantly different from those found on managed banks. The biological trait composition such as "maximum potential size," "life cycle duration," "reproduction," "feeding habits," and "trophic status" differed significantly among riverbanks, especially between natural banks and the riprap, mixed, and cribwall trio. In a context of macroinvertebrate biodiversity and functional restoration, we can advocate the fascine technique as the most suitable technique tested.

AB Life cycle strategies have evolved extensively throughout the history of metazoans. The expression of disparate life stages within a single ontogeny can present conflicts to trait evolution, and therefore may have played a major role in shaping metazoan forms. However, few studies have examined the consequences of adding or subtracting life stages on patterns of trait evolution. By analysing trait evolution in a clade of closely related salamander lineages we show that shifts in the number of life cycle stages are associated with rapid phenotypic evolution. Specifically, salamanders with an aquaticonly (paedomorphic) life cycle have frequently added vertebrae to their trunk skeleton compared with closely related lineages with a complex aquatic-to-terrestrial (biphasic) life cycle. The rate of vertebral column evolution is also substantially lower in biphasic lineages, which may reflect the functional compromise of a complex cycle. This study demonstrates that the consequences of life cycle evolution can be detected at very fine scales of divergence. Rapid evolutionary responses can result from shifts in selective regimes following changes in life cycle complexity.

AB Major gene effects on traits associated with substance use disorders are rare. Previous findings in methamphetamine drinking (MADR) lines of mice, bred for high or low voluntary MA intake, and in null mutants demonstrate a major impact of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (Taar1) gene on a triad of MA-related traits: MA consumption, MA-induced conditioned taste aversion and MA-induced hypothermia. While inbred strains are fundamentally genetically stable, rare spontaneous mutations can become fixed and result in newor aberrant phenotypes. A single nucleotide polymorphismin Taar1 that encodes a missense proline to threonine mutation in the second transmembrane domain (Taar1(m1J)) has been identified in the DBA/2J strain. MA is an agonist at this receptor, but the receptor produced by Taar1(m1J) does not respond to MA or endogenous ligands. In the present study, we used progeny of the C57BL/6J x DBA/2J F2 cross, the MADR lines, C57BL/6J x DBA/2J recombinant inbred strains, and DBA/2 mice sourced from four vendors to further examine Taar1-MA phenotype relations and to define the chronology of the fixation of the Taar1(m1J) mutation. Mice homozygous for Taar1(m1J) were found at high frequency early in selection for high MA intake in multiple replicates of the high MADR line, whereas Taar1(m1J) homozygotes were absent in the low MADR line. The homozygous Taar1(m1J) genotype is causally linked to increased MA intake, reduced MA-induced conditioned taste aversion, and reduced MA-induced hypothermia across models. Genotype-phenotype correlations range from 0.68 to 0.96. This Taar1 polymorphism exists in DBA/2J mice sourced directly from The Jackson Laboratory, but not DBA/2 mice sourced from Charles River (DBA/2NCrl), Envigo (formerly Harlan Sprague Dawley; DBA/2NHsd) or Taconic (DBA/2NTac). By genotyping archived samples from The Jackson Laboratory, we have determined that this mutation arose in 2001-2003. Our data strengthen the conclusion that the mutant Taar1(m1J) allele, which codes for a non-functional receptor protein, increases risk for multiple MA-related traits, including MA intake, in homozygous Taar1(m1J) individuals.

AB Environmental variability is ubiquitous, but its effects on populations are not fully understood or predictable. Recent attention has focused on how rapid evolution can impact ecological dynamics via adaptive trait change. However, the impact of trait change arising from plastic responses has received less attention, and is often assumed to optimize performance and unfold on a separate, faster timescale than ecological dynamics. Challenging these assumptions, we propose that gradual plasticity is important for ecological dynamics, and present a study of the plastic responses of the freshwater green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as it acclimates to temperature changes. First, we show that C. reinhardtii's gradual acclimation responses can both enhance and suppress its performance after a perturbation, depending on its prior thermal history. Second, we demonstrate that where conventional approaches fail to predict the population dynamics of C. reinhardtii exposed to temperature fluctuations, a new model of gradual acclimation succeeds. Finally, using high-resolution data, we show that phytoplankton in lake ecosystems can experience thermal variation sufficient to make acclimation relevant. These results challenge prevailing assumptions about plasticity's interactions with ecological dynamics. Amidst the current emphasis on rapid evolution, it is critical that we also develop predictive methods accounting for plasticity.

AB Zhengmai 7698 is an elite winter wheat variety widely cultivated in the Southern regions of the Yellow-Huai River Valley of China. Here, we report the molecular markers used for breeding Zhengmai 7698 and the genome composition of this cultivar revealed using genome-wide SNPs. A total of 26 DNA markers derived from the genes controlling gluten protein quality, grain hardness, flour color, disease resistance, or pre-harvesting sprouting resistance were used during breeding. Consequently, Zhengmai 7698 had strong gluten, high grain hardness index, white flour color, and high levels of resistance to powdery mildew, stripe rust infections, and pre-harvesting sprouting. Using genome complexity reduction, 28,996 high-quality SNPs distributed on 21 wheat chromosomes were identified among Zhengmai 7698 and its three parental lines (4B269, Zhengmai 9405 and Zhoumai 16). Zhengmai 7698 shared 12,776, 14,411 and 16,085 SNPs with 4B269, Zhengmai 9405 and Zhoumai 16, respectively. Thus, the contributions of 4B269, Zhengmai 9405 and Zhoumai 16 to the genome of Zhengmai 7698 were comparable. Interestingly, Zhengmai 7698 had 307 unique SNPs that are absent in all three parents. We suggest that molecular markers facilitate selection of a wheat cultivar with multiple elite traits. Analysis of genome composition with SNPs may provide useful clues for further dissecting the genetic basis of improved wheat performance.

AB The eggs of the European cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, develop attached to the seafloor in shallow water habitats and possess a relatively thick black capsule that protects them from the surrounding environment. Since embryological development may take several months, eggs are vulnerable to a variety of threats present in shallow waters, including predation. This study investigates predation of S. officinalis eggs by benthic invertebrates. Twenty-eight invertebrate species from 6 different phyla and with diverse feeding habits were tested as potential predators under laboratory conditions. We also investigated how the feeding traits of these species are related to the mechanical ability to break the egg capsule and prey upon cuttlefish embryos. Species that fed on cuttlefish eggs were the sea snail Bolinus brandaris, the crab Cancer pagurus, the hermit crab Dardanus arrosor, the lobster Homarus gammarus, the invasive blue crab Callinectes sapidus, the shrimp Squilla mantis, the sea urchins Echinus melo, Cidaris sp. and Paracentrotus lividus and the starfish Astropecten aranciacus. It is of note that C. sapidus is a potential predatory crab. which raises the concern that this invasive species may constitute a novel threat for cuttlefish eggs as more populations become established in NE Atlantic waters. Of the biological traits examined, prey capture tools in the tested species best explained the experimental feeding results, suggesting that predation of S. officinalis eggs was determined generally by a mechanical factor and highlighting the importance of the protective egg capsule against predators. However, chemosensory factors are likely to be implicated as well. Thus, this work contributes to the understanding of the ecology of early life stages of cuttlefish and the factors that can affect offspring survival and subsequently impact the recruitment of this species.

AB This paper presented the fish species richness at geographical unit of the Yangtze River. According to the fish taxonomic catalogs and biological traits, R language method was used to determine taxonomic diversity and functional diversity and the components of each unit. Regression analysis was used to test the varying tendency of taxonomic and functional diversity corresponding to the change of species richness.
   Functional diversity is compared against taxonomic diversity in capturing the structure of dynamic ecosystem.
   The beta-diversity indices of taxonomy and function were calculated and decomposed to evaluate the role of species turnover and nestedness in the formation process of fish spatial pattern.
   An integrated diversity index, balancing alpha and beta diversity of species richness, taxonomic and functional diversity, is used to screen the prior conservation zone. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The Caura National Park encompasses the entire basin of the River Caura, one of the most biodiverse hydrographic systems of Venezuela, yet the ichthyofauna, particularly in the upper basin, has been poorly studied. In this study, the taxonomic and functional diversity of fishes in mesohabitats of the River Kakada, a main tributary of the upper River Caura in Southern Venezuela, are described. The fishes were sampled in four mesohabitat types with seines during four different occasions, representing the hydrological seasons of rising waters, high waters, falling waters and low waters. Functional diversity indices were calculated based on four traits: size, trophic guild, mouth orientation and body shape. A total of 56 fish species were registered. There were significant differences in species composition of the fish assemblages and their taxonomic diversities among mesohabitats and across hydrological seasons, and the taxonomic and functional diversities were higher in the mesohabitats with presence of riparian forest. However, there were no seasonal variations in functional composition or functional diversities. The rocky substrates had unique assemblages of habitat specialist species with a particular array of traits. On the other hand, the presence of riparian forest and more structurally complex substrates favors the coexistence of a high diversity of fishes with a variety of trait combinations, whereas the seasonal fluctuations in the water level might propitiate stochastic processes of dispersion and colonisation that generate variations in species composition and taxonomic diversity. Considering the spread of artisanal gold mines in the Caura National Park, the results of this investigation might serve as a reference for future studies that assess the impacts of the gold mining activities on the river integrity and their fish communities.

AB Speciation in subterranean habitats is commonly explained as the result of divergent selection in geographically isolated populations; conversely, the contribution of niche partitioning in driving subterranean species diversification has been rarely quantified. The present study integrated molecular and morphological data with a hypervolume analysis based on functional traits to investigate a potential case of parapatric speciation by means of niche differentiation in two sibling spiders inhabiting contiguous subterranean habitats within a small alpine hypogean site. Troglohyphantes giachinoi, sp. nov. and T. bornensis are diagnosed by small details of the genitalia, which are likely to be involved in a reproductive barrier. Molecular analysis recovered the two species as sister, and revealed a deep genetic divergence that may trace back to the Messinian (similar to 6 million years ago). The hypervolume analysis highlighted a marginal overlap in their ecological niches, coupled with morphological character displacement. Specifically, T. giachinoi, sp. nov. exhibits morphological traits suitable for thriving in the smaller pores of the superficial network of underground fissures (Milieu Souterrain Superficiel, MSS), whereas T. bornensis shows a greater adaptation to the deep subterranean habitat. Our results suggest that different selective regimes within the subterranean environment, i.e. deep caves v. MSS, may either drive local speciation or facilitate contiguous distributions of independently subterranean adapted species.

AB Most alpine floodplains are heavily modified and have lost their natural habitat dynamics and biodiversity. However, little is known about the consequences for floodplain forests. To study this topic, the Bavarian River Ammer was selected. An analysis of the effects of river regulation was possible within the 'Schnalzaue' where 55 years ago a weir and a dam had been built separating an active and inactive section of the floodplain. A comparison between both sections helps assessing the effect of the dam on the alluvial grey-alder forests (Alnetum incanae), as basis for future restoration. We expected lower disturbance, lower moisture and higher nutrient supply in the inactive floodplain and thus, a transition to a maple-ash forest (Adoxo-Aceretum). Therefore, we analysed species composition, functional plant traits of the leaf-height-seed scheme (leaf dry matter content, plant height, seed mass) and Ellenberg indicators (indicator values for moisture and nutrients, indicator species for flooding and for periodical wet conditions). The ordination results indicated different species compositions in both floodplain sections, while this was poorly reflected by the results of a syntaxonomic analysis. The latter suggested presence of a rarely flooded Asarum-subassociation of grey-alder forest in both floodplain sections. In the sections, similar site conditions prevailed regarding moisture and nutrient supply, while plant height indicated slightly more disturbance in the active floodplain. Overall, the results reveal low disturbance in both sections, even though the active one is connected with the river. A reason for this finding could be increased erosion of River Ammer downstream the weir with respective lower water levels. Accordingly, restoration should improve river dynamics in the entire floodplain to allow more frequent disturbance as a measure to maintain the grey-alder forest in the long term.

AB Oryza glaberrima is the African cultivated rice species, domesticated from its wild ancestor by farmers living in Inland Delta of Niger River. Several studies indicated that it has extremely narrow genetic diversity compared to both its wild progenitor, Oryza barthii and the Asian rice, Oryza sativa which can mainly be attributed to a severe domestication bottleneck. Despite its scarcity in farmer's field due to its low yield potential, high shattering and lodging susceptibility, O. glaberrima is of great value not only to Africa but also globally. Perhaps its greatest contribution to regional and global food security is as a source of genes, as it possesses resistance/ tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. It also has unique starch- related traits which give it good cooking and eating properties. Advances in DNA sequencing have provided useful genomic resources for African rice, key among them being whole genome sequences. Genomic tools are enabling greater understanding of the useful functional diversity found in this species. These advances have potential of addressing some of the undesirable attributes found in this species which have led to its continued replacement by Asian rice. Development of new generation of rice varieties for African farmers will therefore require the adoption of advanced molecular breeding tools as these will allow efficient utilization of the wealth and resilience found in African rice in rice improvement.

AB We studied the relationships between structural and functional diversity within and among macrophyte communities of softwater lakes. Diversity was assessed based on Simpson's diversity index (SD), species richness (S), Rao's functional diversity (FDQ) and shared plant traits along a gradient of pH. A total of 10,800 cover-plant samples (area=0.1 m(2)) were analysed, collected from 241 sections of the bottom (with a depth resolution of 1.0 m) of 38 lakes in Poland. We identified 59 species of macrophytes and recognized four communities. Along a gradient of increasing pH we found i) an increase of species richness; ii) a uniformity of abundance in communities; and iii) an increase in the quantitative contribution of life history traits such as perennials, submerged anchoring, leaf placement along an orthotropic shoot and generative reproduction. On the other hand, there was a decrease in unanchored and evergreen perennials. In our study, we found that the variety of these traits within communities is greater than that between them. Within lakes, structural diversity was low, whereas it was high between lakes. Functional diversity exhibited an opposite pattern; it was high at lake scale, and low between lakes. A combination of partitioning diversity and utilizing environmental variables significantly improves the prediction of community structure and the conservation of lakes.

AB The number of studies assessing the downstream effects of multiple reservoirs on benthic communities over a large spatial scale has been disproportionally less compared with studies of the effects of a single reservoir, while even fewer studies have examined the responses of non-insect macroinvertebrates on the impact of river discontinuity. The main objective here is to present the effect of seven large reservoirs in a 364-km long stretch of the Vah River, which is the longest river in Slovakia. We assessed the longitudinal changes in environmental variables to identify their possible cumulative effect and recovery distance. Moreover, the spatial variability in the taxonomical and functional structure of the non-insect benthic invertebrate community was evaluated. We do not detect the true cumulative effect of any variable, because of the apparent recovery before reaching the next reservoir. Although the environmental variables closely match with the division of the river based on the river network development, the non-insect community indicates a more extensive disruption of the river environment. On the basis of species data clustering, three groups of sites (stretches) are found to reflect their longitudinal position in the river rather than their position relative to the reservoir (upstream, downstream and in-between sites). The difference between these groups also mirrors the functional structure of the benthic community. Water temperature, conductivity and chemical oxygen demand create a significant gradient causing shifts in taxonomical, as well as functional community composition. The canonical correspondence analysis shows that all reservoirs cause a shift in the structure of benthic communities as they are similar to communities at more distant sites downstream. Moreover, the reservoirs situated in the upper and middle stretch of the river were detected to have the most impact on the ecological attributes of the community. The multi-level pattern analysis reveals 31 non-insect taxa and four functional traits associated with one or two river stretches in a longitudinal profile of the Vah River. Of the indicator species, Stylaria lacustris, Nais christinae, Ophidonais serpentina and Limnodrilus claparedeianus are found to be associated with the severe downstream modification (potamalization) of the river environment induced by reservoirs.

AB A new stalk-forming diatom was observed at high relative abundances on periphytic samples collected in the Rio Negro hydrographic basin (Brazilian Amazon) and is here described using light and scanning electron microscopy. We also present ecological preferences of the new species. Eunotia amazonica sp. nov. co-dominated periphytic samples collected during the rainy seasons of 2013 and 2014 near the city of Manaus (Amazonas, Brazil). The main diagnostic feature of the new species is the stalk-forming growth form (Cymbella-like') illustrated here for the first time in the genus Eunotia Ehrenberg. Previous reports on growth forms in common European databases for this genus included colonial (ribbon-like') but also mobile', fixed by pads' or without structures of fixation'. We demonstrated that the three dominant Eunotia species in periphytic samples from the Rio Negro all exhibited distinct growth forms' or habits: Eunotia amazonica sp. nov. (stalked), Eunotia intricans Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (ribbon-like) and Eunotia rabenhorstiana (Grunow) Hustedt (branched-arborescent). The high diversity of species, many of which are unknown to science, as well as the poorly known life-forms and habits of the Eunotiaceae in the region, partially prevent the use of metrics based on life-form to assess ecological changes. Generic assumptions based on robust statistical methods may obscure reality and lead to biased conclusions of diatom community changes in poorly explored regions such as Neotropical freshwater rivers, where the Eunotiaceae are largely dominant, particularly in the Amazon basin.

AB Considered are the history and the modern state of ecological classifications of plant species - those physiognomical (marking out of life forms, growth forms, and functional types of plants) and ecological (marking out of ecological groups) ones. The first approach turned up in the beginning of XIX century, the second - in the middle of XX century. At the base of modern ecological classifications development lies the pragmatic approach directed to advancement of their efficiency when using them in geobotanic practice.

AB Understanding large-scale spatial variation in ecosystem properties and associated functionality is key for successful conservation of ecosystems. This study provides a template for how to estimate differences in ecosystem functionality over large spatial scales by using groupings of biological traits. We focus on trait groupings that describe three important benthic ecosystem properties, namely bioturbation, community stability, and juvenile dispersal. Recognizing that groups of traits interact and are constrained within an organism, we statistically define important functional trait subgroups that describe each ecosystem property. The sub-groups are scored according to their weighted ecological impact to gain an overall estimation of the cumulative expression of each ecosystem property at individual sites. Furthermore, by assigning each property a value relative to its observed maximum, and by summing up the individual property values, we offer an estimate of benthic ecosystem multi-functionality. Based on a spatially extensive benthic data set, we were able to identify coastal areas with high and low potential for the considered benthic ecosystem properties and the measure of ecosystem multifunctionality. Importantly, we show that a large part of the spatial variation in functional trait sub-groups and in benthic ecosystem multifunctionality was explained by environmental change. Our results indicate that through this simplification it is possible to estimate the functionality of the seafloor. Such information is vital in marine spatial planning efforts striving to balance the utilization with the preservation of natural resources.

AB Traditionally, species richness and composition of freshwater communities are expected to change according to the structural variation from headwaters to river mouth. In the present study, we hypothesised that fish functional traits will respond to this gradient, leading to functional dissimilarities between fish assemblages of headwaters and those of rivers. We addressed the following questions: (1) which functional traits are present in fish assemblages of each habitat type; (2) which environmental factors determine the occurrence of fish functional traits; and (3) how functional traits are related to each environmental variable? Our findings showed dissimilarities between fish assemblages of headwaters and those of rivers, mainly driven by channel depth, channel width, water temperature, water turbidity and concentration of dissolved oxygen, whereas altitude, water temperature and pH were mainly correlated with variation within each habitat type. These results suggested that not only do the physical variables proposed in classical theory of the river-continuum concept follow the upstream-downstream gradient in structuring the functional organisation of fish assemblages, but that also physicochemical variables, such as turbidity and concentration of dissolved oxygen, display this trend in tropical river systems. Moreover, our results have given a first perspective on what kind of fish species and fish functional traits to expect in each habitat type and, consequently, along the headwater-river mouth gradient.

AB By modifying local habitat conditions, the alteration of land cover can result in severe faunal impairment, subsequently affecting ecosystem functioning. We analyzed changes in the composition of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) assemblages along a gradient of human disturbance intensity in 66 neotropical savanna headwater stream sites. Whereas EPT genus richness did not differ among the levels of disturbance, functional richness and diversity significantly decreased from least-to highly disturbed sites. Using a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, we found that 12 of 28 trait categories were significantly associated with changes in catchment land use and cover intensity, local physical habitat, and water quality. EPT assemblages in least-disturbed sites were characterized by higher proportions of large body size and low body flexibility with < 1 reproductive cycle per year, case building, and climbing functional traits. In addition, disturbed sites demonstrated high assemblage functional homogenization compared with least disturbed sites. To our knowledge, this study is the first that examines the response of invertebrate functional structure along a gradient of human disturbance at a large spatial scale in the Neotropics. In doing so, we demonstrate the applicability of multiple trait-based approaches and the higher reliability of functional structure in comparison to taxonomic composition for assessing the effects of human disturbances in neotropical streams.

AB Species responses to climate change have been shown to vary in both direction and magnitude. Understanding these idiosyncratic responses is crucial if we are to predict extinction risk and set up efficient conservation strategies. The variations observed across species have been related to several species attributes including intrinsic traits such as physiological tolerances or life-history strategies but also to niche characteristics (e.g., niche breadth [NB], niche position [NP]). However, although previous studies have successfully linked species attributes to population dynamics or range shifts, few have considered synergistic effects to explain responses to climate variations. Here, we assessed whether five species attributes (fecundity, thermal safety margin, trophic position [TP], NB, and NP) explained interspecific differences in four parameters influencing population dynamics of 35 stream fish species at the French scale. We used Bayesian N-mixture models to estimate posterior distributions of the growth rate, the strength of density dependence, and the influence of both mean temperature and temperature variability on populations for each species. We then used phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models to investigate the influence of species attributes and their interactions on interspecific differences in each of the four parameter driving population dynamics. The percentage of variance explained by the PGLS models was relatively high (around 40% on average), indicating that species attributes are good predictors of species population dynamics. Furthermore, we showed that the influence of these single attributes was mediated by other attributes, especially NP and TP. Importantly, we found that models including interaction terms had greater support over simple additive models in explaining interspecific differences in population dynamics. Taken together, these results point to the importance of considering the interplay between species attributes in unraveling the mechanisms involved in population dynamics and understanding the vulnerability of species to global change.

AB The Arauca River harbors a considerable fish biodiversity, yet it remains poorly sampled and the knowledge about its fish communities is incomplete. We studied the taxonomic and functional composition and diversity of catfish assemblages in one lotic and one lentic habitat of a segment of this floodplain during one hydrological cycle, from August 2014 to August 2015, comprising six samplings using gillnets, and identified the relationships between catfish traits and the environment based on five limnological variables. The functional structure was studied through 11 morphological measures and the species diets. We identified 31 catfish species and nine trophic groups. There were significant differences in species composition and diversity between habitats and months, but the functional structure of the catfishes was only determined by the temporal variability. The functional structure of the catfish assemblages was ordered by morphological traits related to locomotion, habitat use, and trophic ecology and these traits were correlated with the limnological variables, supporting the existence of environmental filters. Integrating the taxonomic and functional perspectives can provide a more complete picture of the ecological patterns of freshwater fish assemblages in the Neotropics and can help us predict how these assemblages might change in response to anthropogenic alterations of the environment.

AB Evolutionary changes in functional traits represent one possible reason why exotic species spread to become invasive, but empirical studies of the mechanisms driving phenotypic differentiation between populations of invasive species are rare. This study tested whether differences in distal spine length among populations of the invasive cladoceran, Bythotrephes longimanus, could be explained by local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. We collected Bythotrephes from six lakes and found that distal spine lengths and natural selection on distal spine length differed among populations, but were unrelated to the gape-limitation of the dominant fish predator in the lake from which they were collected. A common garden experiment revealed significant genetic and maternal variation for distal spine length, but phenotypic differences among populations were not genetically based. Phenotypic differences among lakes in this ecologically important trait are, therefore, the result of plasticity and not local adaptation, despite spatially variable selection on this heritable trait. The ability of Bythotrephes to plastically adjust distal spine length may explain the success of this species at invading lake ecosystems with diverse biotic environments.

AB 1. Understanding the mechanisms that drive beta diversity (i.e. beta-diversity), an important aspect of regional biodiversity, remains a priority for ecological research. beta-diversity and its components can provide insights into the processes generating regional biodiversity patterns. We tested whether environmental filtering or dispersal related processes predominated along the stream watercourse by analysing the responses of taxonomic and functional diatom beta-diversity to environmental and spatial factors.
   2. We examined the variation in total beta-diversity and its components (turnover and nestedness) in benthic diatom species and ecological guilds (motile, planktonic, low-and high profile) with respect to watercourse position (up-, mid-and downstream) in 2,182 sites throughout France. We tested the effects of pure environmental and pure spatial factors on beta-diversity with partial Mantel tests. Environmental factors included eight physicochemical variables, while geographical distances between sites were used as spatial factors. We also correlated a and c-diversity, and the degree of nestedness (NODF metric) with environmental variables.
   3. Total beta-diversity and its turnover component displayed higher values upstream than mid-and downstream. The nestedness component exhibited low values, even when NODF values increased from up-to downstream. Pure environmental factors were highly significant for explaining total beta-diversity and turnover regardless of watercourse position, but pure spatial factors were mostly significant mid-and downstream, with geographical distance being positively correlated with beta-diversity. Across sites, nutrient enrichment decreased turnover but increased the degree of nestedness. Motile and low profile diatoms comprised the most abundant guilds, but their beta-diversity patterns varied in an opposite way. The lowest guild beta-diversity was observed upstream for low profile species, and downstream for motile species.
   4. In conclusion, environmental filtering seemed to play a major role in structuring metacommunities irrespective of site watercourse position. Filtering promoted strong turnover patterns, especially in disconnected upstream sites. The greater role of spatial factors mid-and downstream was consistent with mass effects rather than neutral processes because these sites had lower total beta-diversity than upstream sites. Motile species were most strongly affected by mass effects processes, whereas low profile species were primarily influenced by environmental conditions. Collectively, these findings suggest that partitioning of total beta-diversity into its components and the use of diatom ecological guilds provide a useful framework for assessing the mechanisms underlying metacommunity patterns along the stream watercourse.

AB 1. Metacommunity models predict that species richness and composition patterns in communities are determined predominantly by environmental selection and dispersal, with speciation and drift playing a lesser role. In the tropics, our understanding about these processes comes almost purely from empirical data; there is lack of formal confrontation between models and data.
   2. Here, we evaluated if a metacommunity simulation model designed for riverine networks could predict insect diversity patterns observed in a tropical stream network within the Atlantic Forest biome. Our individual-oriented model simulated biological processes, including dispersal of adults, oviposition, dispersal of larvae, colonisation and mortality. We used this model to simulate communities considering three assembly scenarios (niche, niche-stochastic and stochastic) and three flight dispersal ability groups (low, medium and high). To parameterise the model, we used data from 97 riffle communities, distributed along a stream network, and biological data from the literature.
   3. For the high dispersal ability group, none of the assembly scenarios significantly predicted the observed richness and community dissimilarity. The niche-stochastic assembly scenario, however, provided a better approximation of observed richness and community dissimilarity for the medium and low dispersal ability groups.
   4. Our results show that deterministic and stochastic processes combine to better explain observed aquatic insect diversity patterns. Although simulations were limited to similar explanatory power to studies using pattern-oriented approaches, our findings highlight the promise of a more predictive use of metacommunity simulation models.

In this article, we describe and evaluate a citizen science program designed to monitor the effect of stream restoration construction disturbance on the macroinvertebrate community. We present the results of a 7-year stream restoration study conducted by citizen scientists utilizing a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design. Trait-based macroinvertebrate data showed a strong response to restoration construction disturbance and return to pre-restoration conditions within 2years. The findings of this study suggest that citizen science can generate meaningful BACI-oriented data about ecological restoration; however, until more research is conducted, citizen data should only be used to augment professional data intended to demonstrate restoration success.

AB Phenotypic plasticity, a process by which individuals modify their morphology, physiology, or behaviour in response to environmental changes, can be seen as the first step in adaptive evolution. Phenotypic plasticity is adaptive if two conditions are met: (1) the phenotype is associated with an environment (plastic response) and (2) the phenotype-environment association increases individual fitness (adaptive response). Using a reciprocal transplant experiment, we tested the hypothesis that functional morphological responses are correlated with growth at two organizational levels (between and within ecotypes) in brook charr. Four-month-old individuals from four littoral and four pelagic families raised in the laboratory were transferred into eight littoral (3mx4mx1.5m depth) and eight pelagic (3 mx4 mx6m depth) lake enclosures for a period of 12weeks. Fin length (the main discriminant trait of the littoral and pelagic ecotypes) was less plastic than body shape. Growth was higher in the pelagic than in the littoral habitat, but offspring from littoral and pelagic parental origins did not experience higher growth in their respective habitats (comparison between ecotypes). The body shape of most individuals transplanted to their reciprocal environment shifted toward the form expected in that environment. This plastic response in body shape was functionally correlated with growth within ecotypes, but only in the littoral habitat. Furthermore, the within-ecotype variance of both morphological traits and growth were higher in the littoral than in the pelagic habitat. Small phenotypic differences could have direct consequences on fitness in the less favourable habitat, inducing higher inter-individual variance in growth and stronger phenotype-growth associations. We suggest that phenotypic accommodation and cryptic genetic variation, two mechanisms previously proposed as mechanisms involved in distinct situations, could be simultaneously involved to hasten the process of adaptive evolution in an unfavourable environment.

AB The Sheldon spectrum describes a remarkable regularity in aquatic ecosystems: the biomass density as a function of logarithmic body mass is approximately constant over many orders of magnitude. While size-spectrum models have explained this phenomenon for assemblages of multicellular organisms, this paper introduces a species-resolved size-spectrum model to explain the phenomenon in unicellular plankton. A Sheldon spectrum spanning the cell-size range of unicellular plankton necessarily consists of a large number of coexisting species covering a wide range of characteristic sizes. The coexistence of many phytoplankton species feeding on a small number of resources is known as the Paradox of the Plankton. Our model resolves the paradox by showing that coexistence is facilitated by the allometric scaling of four physiological rates. Two of the allometries have empirical support, the remaining two emerge from predator-prey interactions exactly when the abundances follow a Sheldon spectrum. Our plankton model is a scale-invariant trait-based size-spectrum model: it describes the abundance of phyto- and zooplankton cells as a function of both size and species trait (the maximal size before cell division). It incorporates growth due to resource consumption and predation on smaller cells, death due to predation, and a flexible cell division process. We give analytic solutions at steady state for both the within-species size distributions and the relative abundances across species.

AB As human population size increases and cities become denser, several urban-related selection pressures increasingly affect species composition in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Yet, it is not well known whether and how urbanization influences other facets of biodiversity, such as the functional and evolutionary composition of communities, and at what spatial scale urbanization acts. Here we used a hierarchical sampling design in which urbanization levels were quantified at seven spatial scales (ranging from 50 to 3200 m radii). We found that urbanization gradients are associated with a strong shift in cladoceran zooplankton species traits, which in turn affected phylogenetic composition of the entire metacommunity, but only when considering urbanization at the smallest spatial scale (50 m radius). Specifically, small cladoceran species dominated in more urbanized ponds whereas large-bodied, strong competitors prevailed in less urbanized systems. We also show that trait and phylogenetic metrics strongly increase the amount of variation in beta-diversity that can be explained by degree of urbanization, environmental and spatial factors. This suggests that the mechanisms shaping beta-diversity in our study system are mediated by traits and phylogenetic relatedness rather than species identities. Our study indicates that accounting for traits and phylogeny in metacommunity analyses helps to explain seemingly idiosyncratic patterns of variation in zooplankton species composition along urbanization gradients. The fact that urbanization acts only at the smallest spatial scale suggests that correctly managing environmental conditions locally has the power to counteract the effects of urbanization on biodiversity patterns. The multidimensional approach we applied here can be applied to other systems and organism groups and seems to be key in understanding how overall biodiversity changes in response to anthropogenic pressures and how this scales up to affect ecosystem functioning.

AB When investigating the fields of biogeography and macroecology, climate- and productivity-related variables are frequently identified as the strongest correlates of species-diversity patterns. These variables have been usually merged under the climate/productivity hypothesis and describe the direct and indirect actions of climate on species. Being among the most vulnerable ecosystems to climate change, streams and rivers are expected to be influenced both by climatic and trophic (i.e. productivity-related) factors. We propose here to distinguish the relative influence of the two processes on large-scale, long-term changes in the functional diversity of freshwater invertebrate communities over two decades in France. To this end, we designed two functional indices using invertebrate traits to surrogate the respective mechanisms: climate vulnerability and feeding specialisation. Using geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, we showed that trends in both indices, along with the initial regional species-pools, have significantly contributed to the overall long-term increase in functional diversity of invertebrate communities. In addition, we highlighted a strong geographical differentiation in the contribution patterns with the climate vulnerability effect decreasing with latitude and the feeding specialisation effect being higher in headwaters than in large rivers. Finally, taking into account this non-stationarity in the ecological processes and responses using GWR models allowed explaining about 75% of the long-term changes in the community diversity. Consequently, this study offers sound perspectives in predicting the future patterns of trends in functional diversity of communities under different scenarios of environmental changes, like climate and/or land-use.

AB Agricultural land use is a primary driver of environmental impacts on streams. However, the causal processes that shape these impacts operate through multiple pathways and at several spatial scales. This complexity undermines the development of more effective management approaches, and illustrates the need for more in-depth studies to assess the mechanisms that determine changes in stream biodiversity. Here we present results of the most comprehensive multi-scale assessment of the biological condition of streams in the Amazon to date, examining functional responses of fish assemblages to land use. We sampled fish assemblages from two large human-modified regions, and characterized stream conditions by physical habitat attributes and key landscape-change variables, including density of road crossings (i.e. riverscape fragmentation), deforestation, and agricultural intensification. Fish species were functionally characterized using ecomorphological traits describing feeding, locomotion, and habitat preferences, and these traits were used to derive indices that quantitatively describe the functional structure of the assemblages. Using structural equation modeling, we disentangled multiple drivers operating at different spatial scales, identifying causal pathways that significantly affect stream condition and the structure of the fish assemblages. Deforestation at catchment and riparian network scales altered the channel morphology and the stream bottom structure, changing the functional identity of assemblages. Local deforestation reduced the functional evenness of assemblages (i.e. increased dominance of specific trait combinations) mediated by expansion of aquatic vegetation cover. Riverscape fragmentation reduced functional richness, evenness and divergence, suggesting a trend toward functional homogenization and a reduced range of ecological niches within assemblages following the loss of regional connectivity. These results underscore the often-unrecognized importance of different land use changes, each of which can have marked effects on stream biodiversity. We draw on the relationships observed herein to suggest priorities for the improved management of stream systems in the multiple-use landscapes that predominate in human-modified tropical forests.

AB Aim: The number of studies investigating the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity has increased substantially, but our general understanding of the drivers of turnover and nestedness remains elusive. Here, we examined the effects of species traits, spatial extent, latitude and ecosystem type on the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity.
   Location: Global. Time period: 1968-2017.
   Major taxa studied: From bacteria to mammals.
   Methods: From the 99 studies that partition total beta diversity into its turnover and nestedness components, we assembled 269 and 259 data points for the pairwise and multiple site beta-diversity metrics, respectively. Our data covered a broad variation in species dispersal type, body size and trophic position. The data were from freshwater, marine and terrestrial realms, and encompassed geographical areas from the tropics to near polar regions. We used linear modelling as a meta-regression tool to analyse the data.
   Results: Pairwise turnover, multiple site turnover and total beta diversity all decreased significantly with latitude. In contrast, multiple site nestedness showed a positive relationship with latitude. Beta-diversity components did not generally differ among the realms. The turnover component and total beta diversity increased with spatial extent, whereas nestedness was scale invariant for pairwise metrics. Multiple site beta-diversity components did not vary with spatial extent. Surprisingly, passively dispersed organisms had lower turnover and total beta diversity than flying organisms. Body size showed a relatively weak relationship with beta diversity but had important interactions with trophic position, thus also affecting beta diversity via interactive effects. Producers had significantly higher average pairwise turnover and total beta diversity than carnivores.
   Main conclusions: The present results provide evidence that species turnover, being consistently the larger component of total beta diversity, and nestedness are related to the latitude of the study area and intrinsic organismal features. We showed that two beta-diversity components had generally opposing patterns with regard to latitude. We highlight that beta-diversity partition may give additional insights into the underlying causes of spatial variability in biotic communities compared with total beta diversity alone.

AB 1. River regulation affects riparian systems world-wide and conservation and restoration efforts are essential to retain biodiversity, and the functioning and services of riverine ecosystems. Effects of regulation on plant species richness have been widely addressed, but the filtering effect of regulation on guilds has received less attention.
   2. We used a functional trait approach to identify adaptive plant strategies through regulation-tolerant traits and predict shifts of riparian vegetation communities in response to regulation. We analysed variation in functional diversity across gradients of hydrological alteration in northern Sweden in relation to modified timing and infrequent major floods, along with frequent short-term inundation.
   3. Functional richness was similar in all study sites, but species richness declined with increasing intensity of regulation, and the species lost were largely functionally redundant (i.e. co-existing species that have similar contribution to an ecosystem function). Guilds of species intolerant to waterlogging were particularly unsuccessful in most regulated sites as they were affected by hydropower dams which replace major fluvial disturbances with frequent short inundation events. We predict that this guild will disappear, with likely consequences for the entire riverine ecosystem.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that functional traits tolerant to waterlogging or submergence and lack of major fluvial disturbances were key to understanding our results. We suggest that the functional trait approach can be integrated with knowledge of other ecosystem components to provide an understanding of ecosystem function that can be used to guide fluvial ecosystem management.

AB 1. Habitat restoration is increasingly undertaken in degraded streams and rivers to help improve biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Follow-up assessments focused on outcomes for biodiversity have often found scant evidence for recovery, raising concerns about the efficacy of habitat restoration for improving ecological integrity. However, responses of other ecological variables, such as ecosystem process rates and the functional trait composition of biological assemblages, have been little evaluated.
   2. We assessed how the restoration of habitat heterogeneity affected multiple functional parameters in 20 boreal stream reaches encompassing both more and less extensively restored sites, as well as channelised and natural reference sites. We further assessed relationships between our functional parameters and a fluvial geomorphic measure of habitat heterogeneity.
   3. Leaf decomposition was positively related to habitat heterogeneity. This was associated with shifts in the functional composition of detritivore assemblages, with the most obligate litter consumers more prominent in reaches showing higher habitat heterogeneity. The deposition of fine particulate organic matter was consistently higher in restored than channelised sites, and was positively related to the heterogeneity gradient. Algal biomass accrual per unit area did not vary either with restoration or the heterogeneity gradient.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that restoration of river habitat heterogeneity can enhance retention and decomposition of organic matter, key ecosystem properties underpinning ecosystem functioning and service delivery. Significantly, enhanced litter decomposition was linked with a change in the functional composition rather than diversity of detritivore assemblages. Future evaluation of the success of habitat restorations should incorporate quantification of ecosystem processes and the functional traits of biota, in addition to measures of fluvial geomorphology and more traditional biotic metrics, to facilitate a more comprehensive and mechanistic assessment of ecological responses.

AB We studied the trait diversity and structure in the fish communities of two floodplain lakes of the Caura River: Aricagua and Paramuto, during one hydrological cycle. We calculated taxonomic and a functional alpha and beta diversities and made comparisons among hydrological seasons and among habitats within each lake based on rarefactions. The trait structure was explored with an RLQ (analysis of a table R of environmental conditions, a table L of abundances of species and a table Q of species traits) analysis, and pairwise relationships between environmental variables and traits were explored with fourth-corner analyses. Despite its smaller extension, Paramuto showed higher alpha taxonomic and trait diversities. The substrates of open sand and those covered by leaf litter were the most diverse habitats in terms of both species and traits. The trait structure of the fish communities was influenced by the hydrological seasons, the lakes as well as water pH and temperature, and in a lesser degree dissolved oxygen, habitat type and total dissolved solids in the water. These factors constitute the habitat templet for the fish community's composition and trait structure.

AB Damming is one of the main causes of the global decline in freshwater biodiversity. Yet, many hydroelectric dams are being built (or planned) in the Neotropics, where the high species diversity and lack of basic ecological knowledge provide a major obstacle to understanding the effects of this environmental change, which has been mostly described from the perspective of taxonomic change. However, this approach does not account for biological function. Trait-based analysis provides an alternative approach to bioassessment. We assessed the impact of dam closure on the functional structure of fish communities of a Neotropical river by applying trait-based analyses to the response of individual traits aggregated at the assemblage level. Fish data were collected during three distinct time periods (1 year before, 1 year after and 5 years after dam closure), at eight sites located downstream of the dam, in the reservoir, transition zone and upstream. The results indicated that reproduction strategies (migration and parental care) and diet (detritivores) were the trait categories mostly affected by the dam, with the response of downstream assemblages differing from upstream of the dam. A trait-based analysis to the impact of damming on fish communities appears to be a promising approach using an initial descriptive analysis of individual traits and regression models of multiple traits that reflect species' adaptation to the new environment. This study provides both an alternative and complementary approach to taxonomic assessment of impacts from damming, contributing towards a more robust evaluation of the response of fish communities to dams.

AB Cry1C is a Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal protein and it can be produced by transgenic rice lines developed in China. Cladocera species are common aquatic arthropods that may be exposed to insecticidal proteins produced in Bt-transgenic plants through ingestion of pollen or crop residues in water. As the cladoceran Daphnia magna plays an important role in the aquatic food chain, it is important to assess the possible effects of Bt crops to this species. To evaluate the safety of the Cry1C protein for D. magna, individuals were exposed to different concentrations of purified Cry1C protein in M4 medium for 21 days. Potassium dichromate (K(2)Cr(2)Ow(7)), a known toxicant to D. magna, was added to M4 medium as a positive control treatment, and pure M4 medium was used as a negative control. Our results show that developmental, reproductive, and biochemical parameters of D. magna were not significantly different between Cry1C and negative control treatments but were significantly inhibited by the positive control. We thus conclude that D. magna is insensitive to Cry1C.

AB Diatom-based ecological quality assessment methods have been implemented and used regularly in the Water Framework Directive. These indices use the species' abundance profiles along a specific environmental gradient, which they aim to assess. However, this approach has several problematic issues including the unstable and fast-changing diatom taxonomy. The use of traits can be a solution if their responses to the environmental pressure are well-defined. Here, we developed taxonomy-based and trait-based diatom assemblage indices to assess the ecological status of riverine sites on a tropical island. The two indices are based on two sub-indices that measure the diatom assemblage response to a nutrient and organic matter/turbidity gradient. Both taxonomy-and trait-based indices correlated significantly with the selected environmental gradients of the test database, which was not used during index development. We showed that traits could be used for quality assessment of the Mayotte rivers and require much less effort than taxonomy-based indices. There were differences between the two types of indices, which are discussed in this paper. As a perspective for further studies, tests of trait-based indices among different eco-regions would be challenging. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sea otters represent an interesting model for studies of mammalian feeding evolution. Although they are marine mammals, sea otters returned to the sea relatively recently and feed at the surface. Therefore, they represent a transitional stage of aquatic adaptation. Currently no feeding performance studies of sea otters have been conducted. The main objective of this study was to characterize the feeding kinematic profile in sea otters. It was hypothesized that sea otters would exhibit a terrestrial feeding behavior and that they forcefully crush hard prey at large gapes. As a result, biting kinematics would be congruent with biting behavior reported for their terrestrial ancestors, thus providing additional evidence that raptorial biting is a conserved behavior even in recently aquatic mammals. Sea otters consistently used a durophagous raptorial biting mode characterized by large gapes, large gape angles and lack of lateral gape occlusion. The shorter skulls and mandibles of sea otters, along with increased mechanical advantages of the masseter and increased bite force, form a repertoire of functional traits for durophagy. Here we consider durophagy to be a specialized raptorial biting feeding mode. A comparison of feeding kinematics of wild versus captive sea otters showed no significant differences in lateral kinematic profiles, and only minor differences in three frontal kinematic profiles, which included a slower maximum opening gape velocity, a slower maximum gape opening velocity, and a slower maximum closing gape velocity in captive sea otters. Data indicate functional innovations for producing large bite forces at wide gape and gape angles.

AB The impact of species loss on ecosystems functioning depends on the amount of trait similarity between species, i.e. functional redundancy, but it is also influenced by the order in which species are lost. Here we investigated redundancy and sensitivity patterns across fish assemblages in lakes, rivers and estuaries. Several scenarios of species extinction were simulated to determine whether the loss of vulnerable species (with high propensity of extinction when facing threats) causes a greater functional alteration than random extinction. Our results indicate that the functional redundancy tended to increase with species richness in lakes and rivers, but not in estuaries. We demonstrated that i) in the three systems, some combinations of functional traits are supported by non-redundant species, ii) rare species in rivers and estuaries support singular functions not shared by dominant species, iii) the loss of vulnerable species can induce greater functional alteration in rivers than in lakes and estuaries. Overall, the functional structure of fish assemblages in rivers is weakly buffered against species extinction because vulnerable species support singular functions. More specifically, a hotspot of functional sensitivity was highlighted in the Iberian Peninsula, which emphasizes the usefulness of quantitative criteria to determine conservation priorities.

AB Arsenic (As) is a toxic element released in aquatic environments by geogenic processes or anthropic activities. To counteract its toxicity, several microorganisms have developed mechanisms to tolerate and utilize it for respiratory metabolism. However, still little is known about identity and physiological properties of microorganisms exposed to natural high levels of As and the role they play in As transformation and mobilization processes. This work aims to explore the phylogenetic composition and functional properties of aquatic microbial communities in As-rich freshwater environments of geothermal origin and to elucidate the key microbial functional groups that directly or indirectly may influence As transformations across a natural range of geogenic arsenic contamination. Distinct bacterial communities in terms of composition and metabolisms were found. Members of Proteobacteria, affiliated to Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria were mainly retrieved in groundwaters and surface waters, whereas Gammaproteobacteria were the main component in thermal waters. Most of the OTUs from thermal waters were only distantly related to 16S rRNA gene sequences of known taxa, indicating the occurrence of bacterial biodiversity so far unexplored. Nitrate and sulfate reduction and heterotrophic As(III)-oxidization were found as main metabolic traits of the microbial cultivable fraction in such environments. No growth of autotrophic As(III)-oxidizers, autotrophic and heterotrophic As(V)-reducers, Fe-reducers and oxidizers, Mn-reducers and sulfide oxidizers was observed. The ars genes, involved in As(V) detoxifying reduction, were found in all samples whereas aioA [As(III) oxidase] and arrA genes [As(V) respiratory reductase] were not found. Overall, we found that As detoxification processes prevailed over As metabolic processes, concomitantly with the intriguing occurrence of novel thermophiles able to tolerate high levels of As.

AB Phenotypic variability is increasingly assessed through functional response and effect traits, which provide a mechanistic framework for investigating how an organism responds to varying ecological factors and how these responses affect ecosystem functioning. Covariation between response and effect traits has been poorly examined at the intraspecific level, thus hampering progress in understanding how phenotypic variability alters the role of organisms in ecosystems. Using a multi-trait approach and a nine-month longitudinal monitoring of individual red-swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), we demonstrated that most of the measured response and effect traits were partially stable during the ontogeny of individuals. Suites of response and effect traits were associated with a response syndrome and an effect syndrome, respectively, which were correlated to form a functional syndrome. Using a bioenergetic model, we predicted that differences in the response syndrome composition of hypothetical populations had important ecological effects on a key ecosystem process (i.e. whole-lake litter decomposition) to a level similar to those induced by doubling population size. Demonstrating the existence of a functional syndrome is likely to improve our understanding of the ecological impacts of phenotypic variation among individuals in wild populations across levels of biological organization, and the linkage between ecosystem and evolutionary ecology.

AB Establishing links between morphology and performance is important for understanding the functional, ecological, and evolutionary implications of morphological diversity. Relationships between morphology and performance are expected to be age dependent if, at different points during ontogeny, animals must perform in different capacities to achieve high fitness returns. Few studies have examined how the relationship between form and function changes across ontogeny. Here, we assess this relationship in the amphibious mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) fish, a species that is both capable of and reliant on tail-flip jumping for terrestrial locomotion. Tail-flip jumping entails an individual transferring its weight to the caudal region of the body, launching itself from the substrate to navigate to new aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. By combining repeated trials of jumping performance in 237 individuals from distinct age classes with a clearing and staining procedure to visualize bones in the caudal region, we test the hypotheses that as age increases (i) average jumping performance (body lengths jumped) will increase, (ii) the amount of variation for each trait will change, and (iii) the patterns of covariation/correlation among traits, which tell us about the integration of form with function, will also change. We find a significant increase in size-adjusted jumping performance with age, and modification to the correlation structure among traits across ontogeny. However, we also find that significant links between form and function evident in young animals disappear at later ontogenetic stages. Our study suggests that different functional mechanisms may be associated with high performance at different stages of development.

AB The mango tree (Mangifera indica L.) is cultivated on a large scale in Brazil for economic purposes. Since the leaves, as the main photosynthetic organs, play an essential role in fruit production, the primary objective of the present study was to analyze comparatively the morphological characteristics of leaves at different stages of expansion and of leaves exposed to different levels of solar radiation. Leaves were collected at the beginning of expansion, during intermediate expansion and when completely expanded, and sun and shade leaves were compared. The individuals were adult plants without flowers and fruits located along the South Lake, Brasilia. The leaves were analyzed for area, specific leaf area (SLA), thickness, water content and anatomical traits. Data were analyzed by ANOVA post hoc Tukey test to test the influence of leaf expansion time and by the T-test to determine the effect of radiation (alpha = 5%). Greater scleromorphy was observed in the completely expanded leaves compared to the leaves at the beginning of expansion, with lower water content and SLA in completely expanded leaves. Higher sclerophyll content was observed in sun leaves than in shade leaves, with lower SLA, greater leaf thickness and greater thickness of adaxial epidermis, palisade parenchyma and mesophyll in sun leaves. Based on these results, greater care is indicated regarding leaf management at the beginning of expansion and the management of shade leaves, since they are more susceptible to damage from herbivores. The objective of this management is to maximize fruit production.

AB Global trait-based analyses can shed light on the factors predisposing species to high extinction risk, and can help bridge knowledge gaps in speciose and poorly known taxa. In this paper, I conduct the first global comparative study of crayfish extinction risk. I collated data on intrinsic (biology and ecology) and extrinsic (environment and threats) factors for 450 crayfish species assessed on the IUCN Red List. Phylogenetic multiple regression models were used to identify correlates of risk in all species; in centres of diversity (American cambarids and Australian parastacids); and among threat types (agriculture, water management, pollution). I assessed the relative ability of threat maps quantifying specific threats (e.g. river fragmentation, mercury deposition) or a generic threat (human population density) to predict crayfish extinction risk. I also quantified the effects of range size on extinction risk with variation partitioning and multiplicative bivariate regressions. Crayfish with small range size, small body size, habitat dependency on caves, and with ranges in areas of low precipitation, high altitude and high human population density were at higher risk of extinction. Correlates of risk varied between American cambarids and Australian parastacids, suggesting that centres of diversity shape patterns of extinction risk in crayfish. The explanatory power of models ranged between 31 and 65%, with low explanatory power for models based on threat types. Few specific threat measures were significantly related to extinction risk, suggesting that large-scale threat mapping may not be informative for freshwater invertebrates. In the absence of population data for most freshwater invertebrates, trait-based models are powerful and cost-effective tools for understanding and mitigating drivers of extinction risk.

AB 1. One of the main causes of biodiversity loss in aquatic ecosystems is instream habitat change associated with land-use change in the drainage basin. Biofuel crop production is an increasingly important driver of land-use change in existing agricultural drainage basins. Conceptually, biofuels such as sugarcane (Saccharum spp.: Poaceea) can provide a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, but little is known about the consequences of biofuel crop production for biodiversity. Thus, our aim was to investigate if and how the degree of further environmental changes at regional and local scales can influence taxonomic and functional structure of fish assemblages in agroecosystem streams.
   2. We quantified drainage basin land use, instream and riparian habitat, and fish assemblages in 38 agroecosystem streams in Brazil with drainage basins experiencing rapid expansion of sugarcane production, and calculated degree of environmental change and corresponding response in taxonomic and functional structure of stream fish assemblages. Procrustes and redundancy analyses tested for correlation between land use and instream habitat and environmental factors correlated with fish assemblage structure, respectively. Previous studies demonstrated relationships between land-use change, instream habitat change and taxonomic and functional structure of stream fish assemblages. Therefore, we used regression to test the hypothesis that degree of environmental change is positively correlated with magnitude of change in taxonomic and functional structure of fish assemblages.
   3. Primary gradients of environmental change included conversion of pasture to sugarcane and reduction of stream width, depth and volume. Although drainage basin and instream attributes were not correlated within a year, we detected a legacy effect of land use on instream habitat. The degree of environmental change was not significantly correlated with taxonomic or functional changes in stream fish assemblages in most cases. However, abundances of resistant taxa increased, whereas nektonic functional groups decreased, and the biological response also presented evidence of a legacy effect.
   \4. Our findings demonstrate that instream habitat and aquatic biodiversity in streams with agricultural drainage basins undergoing rapid conversion to biofuel production likely will not experience the full magnitude of responses in the short term. Therefore, repeated sampling of sufficient duration to account for legacy effects or time lags is needed to test for effects of biofuel expansion on biodiversity, and similarly to assess whether management practices such as riparian zone preservation can benefit biodiversity in agroecosystems.

AB Rivers are representative lotic freshwater ecosystems and are regarded as the lotic belt for transportation of nutrients and pollutants from the land to the sea. To understand the global research profile and fronts of river phytoplankton, 13,434 publications regarding river phytoplankton indexed by Web of Science during 1991-2016 were analyzed using a bibliometric approach. The EU Water Framework Directive presents a good case for promoting not only frequent cooperation between European countries but also the development of river phytoplankton studies. Such directives are anticipated to promote global consistency of the water evaluations and management in the future. Phytoplankton play important roles in bio-assessments and energy flow of river ecosystems. The trait-based method has many advantages compared with traditional methods based on community composition and metric indices. The trait-based method considers a complex mixture of stressors by combining qualitative and quantitative parameters but also transfers different geographic taxonomic compositions to a similar complement of traits. Moreover, phytoplankton-based food chains are generally considered to transfer energy and carbon more efficiently to higher trophic levels than bacterial-based food chains. Algae are a high-quality food for higher trophic levels, compared with bacteria and terrestrial material. The algal component of periphyton has been demonstrated to be the major basal component of stream food webs.

AB The aim of this work was to determine the ways in which the associations of phytoplankton (species, classes, and functional groups) responded to different trophic states in a series of Mediterranean reservoirs (La Llosa del Caval, Sant Ponc, La Baells, Santa Fe, Susqueda, Sau, and Foix). The results showed that the average trophic state index increased from the reservoirs with lower trophic states (La Llosa, Sant Ponc, and La Baells) to those with higher trophic states (Santa Fe, Susqueda, Sau, and Foix). The structure of the phytoplankton community followed the trophic gradients of these reservoirs. Differences in illumination, nutrient supply, and mixing regime were the determining factors of this pattern, and were reflected in the functional groups found. In the La Llosa, San Ponc, and La Baells reservoirs, oligotrophic conditions, extensive euphotic zones, and deficiency of phosphorus were associated with small flagellated mixotrophic organisms belonging to the Lo, E, X2, X3, A, and R functional groups. The Susqueda and Sau reservoirs were classified as mesotrophic and eutrophic, respectively, and were mainly dominated by small organisms tolerant to deficiency of light and nutrients (phosphorus), represented by the functional groups B, A, H1, X1, MP, N, J, S1, Y, and Lo. The hypereutrophic Foix reservoir, characterized by nutrient-rich conditions with high concentrations of organic matter, was dominated by large organisms tolerant to light deficiency and high turbidity, represented by codons Y, H1, and W2. In the Santa Fe reservoir, there was a predominance of algae represented by functional groups W2 and C, which were adapted to light deficiency, slightly acidic pH, and high levels of nutrients such as phosphorus and silicate. It could be concluded that for these ecosystems, classification according to the Q-Index index corresponded to classification using the trophic state index (TSI), with the reservoirs classified as oligotrophic and mesotrophic being considered to have Good and High ecological status, respectively, while the eutrophic and hypereutrophic reservoirs showed Tolerable and Medium conditions, respectively. From exploratory analyses, conducted using the environmental variables and the composition of the phytoplankton community, considering the descriptor species, classes and functional groups, it appeared that all of the parameters could explain the community. Nonetheless, this research confirmed the potential use of phytoplankton functional groups, since they can provide information on the ecology, functional traits, and tolerances of the species, characterizing the trophic states of the reservoirs.

AB More than one-half of the world's population lives in urban areas, so quantifying the effects of urbanization on ecological communities is important for understanding whether anthropogenic stressors homogenize communities across environmental and climatic gradients. We examined the relationship of impervious surface coverage (a marker of urbanization) and the structure of stream macroinvertebrate communities across the state of Maryland and within each of Maryland's three ecoregions: Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Appalachian, which differ in stream geomorphology and community composition. We considered three levels of trait organization: individual traits, unique combinations of traits, and community metrics (functional richness, functional evenness, and functional divergence) and three levels of impervious surface coverage (low [<2.5%], medium [2.5% to 10%], and high [>10%]). The prevalence of an individual trait differed very little between low impervious surface and high impervious surface sites. The arrangement of trait combinations in community trait space for each ecoregion differed when impervious surface coverage was low, but the arrangement became more similar among ecoregions as impervious surface coverage increased. Furthermore, trait combinations that occurred only at low or medium impervious surface coverage were clustered in a subset of the community trait space, indicating that impervious surface affected the presence of only a subset of trait combinations. Functional richness declined with increasing impervious surface, providing evidence for environmental filtering. Community metrics that include abundance were also sensitive to increasing impervious surface coverage: functional divergence decreased while functional evenness increased. These changes demonstrate that increasing impervious surface coverage homogenizes the trait diversity of macroinvertebrate communities in streams, despite differences in initial community composition and stream geomorphology among ecoregions. Community metrics were also more sensitive to changes in the abundance rather than the gain or loss of trait combinations, showing the potential for trait-based approaches to serve as early warning indicators of environmental stress for monitoring and biological assessment programs.

AB Many large European rivers have undergone multiple pressures that have strongly impaired ecosystem functioning at different spatial and temporal scales. Global warming and other environmental changes have favored the success of invasive species, deeply modifying the structure of aquatic communities in large rivers. Some exogenous species could alter trophic interactions within assemblages by increasing the predation risk for potential prey species (top-down effect) and limiting the dynamics of others via resource availability limitation (bottom-up effect). Furthermore, large transboundary rivers are complex aquatic ecosystems that have often been poorly investigated so that data for assessing long-term ecological trends are missing. In this study, we propose an original approach for investigating long-term combined effects of global warming, trophic resource decrease, predation risk, and water quality variations on the trait-based structure of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages over 26 yr (1985-2011) and 427-km stretch of the river Meuse (France and Belgium). The study of temporal variations in biological, physiological, and ecological traits of macroinvertebrate and fish allowed identifying community trends and distinguishing impacts of environmental perturbations from those induced by biological alterations. We provide evidence, for this large European river, of an increase in water temperature (close to 1 degrees C) and a decrease in phytoplankton biomass (-85%), as well as independent effects of these changes on both invertebrate and fish communities. The reduction of trophic resources in the water column by invasive molluscs has dramatically affected the density of omnivorous fish in favor of invertebrate feeders, while scrapers became the major feeding guild among invertebrates. Macroinvertebrate and fish communities have shifted from large-sized organisms with low fecundity to prolific, small-sized organisms, with early maturity, as a response to increased predation pressure.

AB The Microcystis aeruginosa complex (MAC) clusters cosmopolitan and conspicuous harmful bloom forming cyanobacteria able to produce cyanotoxins. It is hypothesized that low temperatures and brackish salinities are the main barriers to MAC proliferation. Here, patterns at multiple levels of organization irrespective of taxonomic identity (i.e. a trait-based approach) were analyzed. MAC responses from the intracellular (e.g. respiratory activity) to the ecosystem level (e.g. blooms) were evaluated in wide environmental gradients. Experimental results on buoyancy and respiratory activity in response to increased salinity (0-35) and a literature review of maximum growth rates under different temperatures and salinities were combined with field sampling from headwaters (800 km upstream) to the marine end of the Rio de la Plata estuary (Uruguay-South America). Salinity and temperature were the major variables affecting MAC responses. Experimentally, freshwater MAC cells remained active for 24 h in brackish waters (salinity = 15) while colonies increased their flotation velocity. At the population level, maximum growth rate decreased with salinity and presented a unimodal exponential response with temperature, showing an optimum at 27.5 degrees C and a rapid decrease thereafter. At the community and ecosystem levels, MAC occurred from fresh to marine waters (salinity 30) with a sustained relative increase of large mucilaginous colonies biovolume with respect to individual cells. Similarly, total biomass and, specific and morphological richness decreased with salinity while blooms were only detected in freshwater both at high (33 degrees C) and low (11 degrees C) temperatures. In brackish waters, large mucilaginous colonies presented advantages under osmotic restrictive conditions. These traits values have also been associated with higher toxicity potential. This suggest salinity or low temperatures would not represent effective barriers for the survival and transport of potentially toxic MAC under likely near future scenarios of increasing human impacts (i.e. eutrophication, dam construction and climate change).

AB We analysed species-level datasets representing Oribatida assemblages along a gradient of old-growth primary tropical forests, secondary forests, and plantation forests in Dong Nai Biosphere Reserve, Vietnam. We identified patterns in abundance, species richness and species assemblages of Oribatida, then applied taxonomic sufficiency approach to the datasets. Using three levels of higher-taxon aggregation, we evaluated whether aggregated datasets are useful in identifying ecological patterns, in comparison to species-level data. Species-level data on Oribatida assemblages clearly separated plantation forests from other forest environments; there was no significant separation between primary and secondary forests. Geographical structuring of species-level assemblages was significant, separating sites from two regions of the reserve. There was a significant concordance between multivariate ordination plots produced for species-level and aggregated (families, suborders/superfamilies) datasets, with Oribatida assemblages of plantation forests consistently separated from two other forest types. Mycobatidae (at family level) and Ceratozetoidea (at suborder/superfamily level) were indicators of plantation forests. The coarsest taxonomic resolution dataset with only four aggregated groups produced no separation of Oribatida assemblages by forest type or region. Moderate level of taxonomic aggregation applied to Oribatida community data did not cause great differences in patterns revealed by multivariate analysis, and therefore could be a valid approach to analysing the structure of tropical Oribatida assemblages. The taxonomic level of suborders and Brachypylina superfamilies appears to be the best compromise for ecological information and ease of identification. Two traits-body size and reproductive mode-were recorded for collected Oribatida species. Community-weighted mean trait value, modified Mason's index of functional divergence, and Rao's index of functional diversity were calculated for each trait in each of the sampled Oribatida assemblages. Sexual reproduction was a dominant reproductive mode in soil Oribatida and did not vary across forest types, indicating similar levels of resource limitation for this trait. For body size, lower functional divergence in plantation forests suggests less scope for niche differentiation and higher competition among different body sizes in this forest type. Use of functional traits can enhance and complement the analysis of Oribatida communities, but more data are needed on feeding- and diet-related traits in tropical Oribatida.

AB Classification of species sensitivity for biomonitoring has been approached under two different frameworks, using either empirical data or expert opinion. Two tools for fine sediment (i.e. clogging and colmation) biomonitoring in the UK tend towards these contrasting approaches. The Proportion of Sediment-sensitive Invertebrates (PSI) index was developed using expert judgement. Empirical weightings were subsequently added at genus or species (EPSI) and mixed (EPSImixed) taxonomic levels, but scores remain constrained by the original categories. In contrast, the Combined Fine Sediment Index, composed of separate taxon scores along organic matter and total fine sediment gradients, was developed using a purely empirical approach. We tested the mechanistic bases for these indices by relating taxon scores to species traits. We compared the results with those for the well-established Whalley Hawkes Paisley Trigg index of organic pollution. After controlling for varying sample sizes, Whalley Hawkes Paisley Trigg could be better predicted by a linear combination of all available traits (mean R-2=0.92) than any of the fine sediment indices (0.68<mean R-2<0.76). When only traits expected to respond to fine sediment were offered as independent variables, the goodness of fit was substantially reduced for all fine sediment indices (0.27<mean R-2<0.46). Our findings demonstrate the lack of integration between the literature on macroinvertebrate responses to fine sediment, the available trait data and taxon scores. Refinement of the trait database is recommended to build on the valuable work performed to date. As the UK has taken the lead in embedding fine sediment into routine biomonitoring programmes, these findings have important international implications. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Intraspecific phenotypic variation is a significant component of biodiversity. Body size, for example, is variable and critical for structuring communities. We need to understand how homogenous and variably sized populations differ in their ecological responses or effects if we are to have a robust understanding of communities. We manipulated body size variation in consumer (tadpole) populations in mesocosms (both with and without predators), keeping mean size and density of these consumers constant. Size-variable consumer populations exhibited stronger antipredator responses (reduced activity), which had a cascading effect of increasing the biomass of the consumer's resources. Predators foraged less when consumers were variable in size, and this may have mediated the differential effects of predators on the community composition of alternative prey (zooplankton). All trophic levels responded to differences in consumer size variation, demonstrating that intrapopulation phenotypic variability can significantly alter interspecific ecological interactions. Furthermore, we identify a key mechanism (size thresholds for predation risk) that may mediate impacts of size variation in natural communities. Together, our results suggest that phenotypic variability plays a significant role in structuring ecological communities.

AB Marine ecosystem models have advanced to incorporate metabolic pathways discovered with genomic sequencing, but direct comparisons between models and "omics" data are lacking. We developed a model that directly simulates metagenomes and metatranscriptomes for comparison with observations. Model microbes were randomly assigned genes for specialized functions, and communities of 68 species were simulated in the Atlantic Ocean. Unfit organisms were replaced, and the model self-organized to develop community genomes and transcriptomes. Emergent communities from simulations that were initialized with different cohorts of randomly generated microbes all produced realistic vertical and horizontal ocean nutrient, genome, and transcriptome gradients. Thus, the library of gene functions available to the community, rather than the distribution of functions among specific organisms, drove community assembly and biogeochemical gradients in the model ocean.

Thus, our goal was to test potential explanations for how Arachis species may have achieved their current distribution.
   LocationSouth America.
   MethodsWe used a dated phylogeny and 1,052 georeferenced records to run several analyses to select the variables that best explain the variation in range size in Arachis species. We tested a set of models incorporating both abiotic (age, association with rivers, niche parameters) and biotic (life span, vegetative growth, dispersal ability) factors thought to influence geographical distribution in order to select those variables that may best explain the range size of Arachis species.
   ResultsWe found that no single factor was able to satisfactorily explain the geographical distribution of wild peanuts. Our results showed that Arachis range sizes are influenced by a combination of differential dispersal ability and age, although the effect of time alone was small. We also found that as Arachis species are geocarpic, their dispersal ability is positively influenced by presence of rhizomes, which improves the distances reached by individuals.
   Main conclusionsOur research shows that the range sizes of wild peanuts are mainly constrained by differential dispersal ability and time, and they are improved by the presence of rhizomatous growth. We also advocate that applying a set of candidate hypotheses to explain species range sizes is a much better alternative than previous attempts, in which single or few hypotheses have been tested at a time.

AB 1. Restoration of degraded plant communities requires understanding of community assembly processes. Human land use can influence plant community assembly by altering environmental conditions and species' dispersal patterns. Flooding, including from environmental flows, may counteract land use effects on wetland vegetation. We examined the influence of land use history and flood frequency on the functional composition of wetland plant communities along a regulated river.
   2. We applied fourth corner modelling to determine species' trait-based responses to flooding and land use by combining data on (i) the occupancy and abundance of species in propagule banks and standing vegetation, (ii) species traits, and (iii) environmental conditions of 22 standing vegetation and 108 soil propagule bank study sites. We used analysis of deviance to test how well each dataset characterised trait-environment interactions, and generalised linear models to identify traits related to species' responses.
   3. The occupancy and abundance of native species in the propagule bank and standing vegetation increased with flood frequency and decreased with duration of agricultural land use. Species in standing vegetation with water-borne propagule dispersal (hydrochory) showed similar trends. In contrast, species with higher specific leaf area were associated with longer land use duration.
   4. Identifying trait-based differences in the propagule bank and standing vegetation can help disentangle effects of dispersal and environmental filters. The occupancy and abundance of hydrochorous species in standing vegetation were negatively related to land use duration, but hydrochorous species were positively related to land use duration based on their abundance in the propagule bank. This suggests that land use does not limit plant dispersal, but acts as an insitu abiotic filter, limiting species present in standing vegetation.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Land use duration and flood frequency have opposite effects on plant community traits in floodplain wetlands of the Macquarie Marshes, Australia. Legacies of agriculture can impede restoration of plant communities. Environmental flows that increase flooding may alleviate these impacts, especially in areas that have been used for agriculture for over 20years, by providing dispersal and environmental filters that favour native wetland species. More flooding will likely be required to restore floodplains with longer histories of agricultural land use compared to floodplains less impacted by agriculture.

AB Trait-based approaches have become increasingly important and valuable in understanding phytoplankton community assembly and composition. These approaches allow for comparisons between water bodies with different species composition. We hypothesize that similar changes in environmental conditions lead to similar responses with regard to functional traits of phytoplankton communities, regardless of trophic state or species composition. We studied the phytoplankton (species composition, community trait mean and diversity) of five reservoirs in Brazil along a trophic gradient from ultra-oligotrophic to meso-eutrophic. Samples at two seasons (summer/rainy and winter/dry) with a horizontal and vertical resolution were taken. Using multivariate analysis, the five reservoirs separated, despite some overlap, according to their environmental variables (mainly total phosphorus, conductivity, pH, chlorophyll a). However, between the seasonal periods, the reservoirs shifted in a similar direction in the multi-dimensional space. The seasonal response of the overall phytoplankton community trait mean differed between the ultra-oligotrophic and the other reservoirs, with three reservoirs exhibiting a very similar community trait mean despite considerable differences in species composition. Within-season differences between different water layers were low. The functional diversity was also unrelated to the trophic state of the reservoirs. Thus, seasonal environmental changes had strong influence on the functional characteristics of the phytoplankton community in reservoirs with distinct trophic condition and species composition. These results demonstrate that an ataxonomic trait-based approach is a relevant tool for comparative studies in phytoplankton ecology.

AB Secondarily marine tetrapods have evolved adaptations to maintain their osmotic balance in a hyperosmotic environment. During the transition to a marine habitat, the evolution of a euryhaline physiology likely encompassed successive changes in behavior and physiology that released organisms from regular access to fresh water. Deciphering these key steps is a complicated task. In this study, we investigated a species of freshwater natricine snake in which some populations are known to use marine environments. We experimentally subjected 30 adult Dice snakes (Natrix tessellata) from a population inhabiting the Black Sea coast to three salinities corresponding to freshwater (similar to 0.1 parts per thousand), brackish water (similar to 15.0 parts per thousand), and full-strength seawater (similar to 34.0 parts per thousand) in order to investigate their physiological (variation of body mass, osmolality) and behavioral (activity, drinking behavior) responses to salinity. Our results show that coastal Dice snakes from the study population are relatively tolerant to salinity close to that recorded in the Black Sea, but that prolonged exposure to full-strength seawater increases osmolality, stimulates thirst, decreases the activity of snakes and may ultimately jeopardize survival. Collectively with previously published data, our results strongly suggest specific physiological adaptations to withstand hyperosmolality rather than to reduce intake of salt, in coastal populations or species of semi-aquatic snakes. Future comparative investigations of Dice snakes from populations restricted to freshwater environment might reveal the functional traits and the behavioral and physiological responses of coastal N. tessellata to life in water with elevated salinity.

AB The rise of global surface temperature by between 1.2 degrees C and 4 degrees C by 2100 is expected to affect freshwater ecosystems and the growth of aquatic plants. By extending the distribution range of invasive macrophytes, climate warming could increase their management costs. The aim of this study was to test the impact of a 3 degrees C warming in spring and in summer on the morphology and physiology of two native species (Mentha aquatica, Myosotis scorpioides) and two invasive species (Ludwigia hexapetala, Myriophyllum aquaticton) under controlled conditions. Our study showed that the increase of spring temperature induced morphological modifications for all species, while a 3 C warming induced changes in carbohydrates composition for native species in spring, and modification of carbohydrate content for invasive species at both seasons. Patterns of carbohydrate content group the two invasive species together, possibly highlighting common physiological mechanisms. Moreover, the increase of spring temperature favoured the apical and/or lateral growth solely for invasive species. Hence, the invasive species specific response to warming suggests that higher temperature may favour their growth in spring, which might allow them to colonise the water column earlier than natives. This competitive advantage could affect aquatic ecosystems functioning and biodiversity in the coming years.

AB Studies of aquatic metacommunities have so far been focused almost entirely on relatively isolated systems, such as a set of streams, lakes or ponds. Here, we aimed to quantify the relative importance of spatial processes, natural factors and anthropogenic stressors in structuring of a macroinvertebrate metacommunity within a large, highly-connected shallow lake system. The roles of different drivers were evaluated for the entire metacommunity, 10 trait-based deconstructed metacommunities and four common species by incorporating extensive sampling and a large number of abiotic explanatory variables. Contrary to our expectations, we found that variation in community structure among sites was mostly correlated to spatial and wind-wave variables rather than anthropogenic disturbance factors even though the lake presented strong environmental gradients associated with long-term human pressures. In addition, the relative importance of the three groups of drivers varied slightly among the deconstructed traitmatrices (i.e. based on dispersal ability, feeding mode and degree of occurrence). Importantly, the distributions of the most common species showed significant and strong spatial autocorrelation, indicating the prominent role of high dispersal rate for their distributions. These findings suggest that the influences of high dispersal rates and natural disturbance may even override the roles of anthropogenic stressors in metacommunity organization in highly connected aquatic systems. Hence, we strongly encourage that spatial processes and natural drivers are taken into account in the development of bioassessment approaches in highly-connected aquatic systems.

AB Climate change and anthropogenic disturbances are expected to lead to more intense and frequent droughts, with potentially severe effects on structure and function of perennial temperate streams. However, more information is required on whether streams flowing through basins already affected by exotic plantations will respond to droughts in the same way as streams under native forests. The recolonisation dynamics of benthic macroinvertebrate communities and leaf litter decomposition rates were examined in nine streams of oceanic temperate climate that differed in catchment vegetation (three streams draining native deciduous forest, three in pine plantations and three in eucalypt plantations) after a marked drought. In each stream, five benthic samples were collected three times (ca. 1.5 months between sampling dates) after flow recovery, and the taxonomic and functional trait compositions of the macroinvertebrate communities were analysed. The decomposition rate ofAlnusglutinosa was measured in fine-and coarse-mesh litter bags. Benthic macroinvertebrate density, richness and diversity increased with time after flow recovery but only richness and diversity differed among stream types, with eucalypt streams showing the lowest values. Both the taxonomic and functional compositions of the macroinvertebrate community were dependent on vegetation type and time, with the differences among stream types diminishing over time. While leaf-litter decomposition rate did not depend on catchment vegetation after drought, detritivore activity was the lowest under eucalypt streams and it was positively correlated to benthic shredder density. Our results indicated that in these perennial temperate streams the catchment vegetation influenced the recovery of benthic macroinvertebrate communities after a period of drought, although the decomposition rate of leaf litter was not strongly affected. Greater understanding of the structural and functional responses of stream ecosystems to different stressors is required before the effects of expected more intense and frequent hydrological changes caused by climate change can be adequately forecast.

AB Salinization is of major global concern due to its effect on stream biota, and ecosystem functions and services. In small streams, litter decomposition is a key ecosystem-level process driven by decomposers, mainly fungi (aquatic hyphomycetes), which link litter and invertebrates. Here we assessed the effects of an environmentally relevant range of salt additions (0, 2, 4, 8,16 g L-1 NaCl) on (1) fungal growth and species-specific reproductive output and (2) fungal mediated-decomposition of Quercus robur leaves. Growth rates of eight out of nine species of aquatic hyphomycetes were negatively affected by salinity at concentrations >= 4 g L-1. EC5Os were species-specific and >= 7.80 g L-1. Distinct thresholds were observed for reproduction: only five species sporulated at 2 g L-1, and a single one (Flagellospora curta) sporulated at 4 and 8 g L-1 NaCl. Based on these results, we evaluated if tolerant fungal assemblages, with increasingly fewer species (9, 5, 1), were able to maintain similar functional functions and processes at the different salt levels. No significant differences were found in oak mass loss or sporulation rates at 0 or 2 g L-1 NaCl; a clear inhibition of both parameters was observed at the highest concentrations (i.e., 4 and 8 g L-1 NaCl). Different dominance patterns in multi-species fungal assemblages may determine bottom-up impacts on the stream food webs through effects on detritivore feeding preferences. Specific growth rate, characterized by RNA concentration, was higher in the single species, at the highest salt-concentration, and lower in the 9-species assemblage. Respiration was almost 2-times higher in mixed assemblages without added salt. Under salt-contamination, trade-offs between growth and sporulation seem to guarantee high levels of fungal growth and decomposition, particularly in multi-species assemblages. In the presence of salt contamination, aquatic hyphomycetes, even at reduced diversity, remain important drivers of leaf decomposition and ensure organic matter recycling. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Context: Understanding natural temporal changes in Mediterranean rivers with contrasting flow regimes in relation to those of temperate rivers may prove helpful in predicting effects of climate change on aquatic biodiversity.
   Goal: We aimed to compare temporal variability in taxonomic and trait compositions of nearly natural rivers in two climatic regions with varying flow regimes to address the effects of future climate changes on aquatic biodiversity in reference conditions.
   Methods: We analysed taxonomic and biological trait compositions using the Foucard multivariate method to compare within-site temporal variability levels and the evolution of within-date spatial variability patterns. In addition, we assessed the effects of temporal variability levels on taxonomic and functional diversity and on community specialization.
   Results: Our results reveal (i) highly fluctuating environments of the Mediterranean region, particularly in intermittent rivers, which lead to higher levels of temporal variability in both taxonomic and trait compositions of benthic invertebrate assemblages, with marked synchrony in Mediterranean streams linked to contrasting flow characteristics; (ii) higher degrees of taxonomic richness associated with higher levels of functional diversity in Mediterranean rivers relative to temperate rivers, (iii) higher temporal stability for functional diversity and trait compositions of benthic invertebrate assemblages than for taxonomic richness and compositions; and (iv) a recovery of all diversity metrics following drying events in intermittent sites.
   Conclusion: This study offers insight into a rarely addressed question concerning the temporal variability of trait compositions in benthic invertebrate assemblages among rivers differing in terms of flow regimes. It suggests that temperate rivers will experience higher levels of temporal variability in terms of taxonomic and trait compositions under future climatic change scenarios, even in sites that will remain perennial, resulting in higher levels of taxonomic and functional diversity. This lack of temporal stability in least-disturbed situations should be taken into account when developing bioassessment tools based on reference conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Deposition of fine sediment that fills interstitial spaces in streambed substrates is widely acknowledged to have significant negative effects on macroinvertebrate communities, but the temporal consistency of clogging effects is less well known. In this study the effects of experimentally enhanced fine sediment content on aquatic invertebrates were examined over 126 days in two lowland UK streams. Taxonomic approaches indicated significant differences in macroinvertebrate community structure associated with sediment treatment (clean or sedimented substrates), although the effects were variable on some occasions. The degree-of separation between clean and sedimented communities was strong within seven of the nine sampling periods with significant differences in community composition being evident. EPT taxa and taxon characterised as sensitive to fine sediment demonstrated strong responses to enhanced fine sediment loading. Faunal traits also detected the effects of enhanced fine sediment loading but the results were not as consistent or marked; More widely, the study highlights the temporal dynamics of sedimentation effects upon macroinvertebrate communities and the need to consider faunal life histories when examining the effects of fine sediment loading pressures on lotic ecosystems.

AB Phragmites australis is a cosmopolitan grass and often the dominant species in the ecosystems it inhabits. Due to high intraspecific diversity and phenotypic plasticity, P. australis has an extensive ecological amplitude and a great capacity to acclimate to adverse environmental conditions; it can therefore offer valuable insights into plant responses to global change. Here we review the ecology and ecophysiology of prominent P. australis lineages and their responses to multiple forms of global change. Key findings of our review are that: (1) P. australis lineages are well-adapted to regions of their phylogeographic origin and therefore respond differently to changes in climatic conditions such as temperature or atmospheric CO2; (2) each lineage consists of populations that may occur in geographically different habitats and contain multiple genotypes; (3) the phenotypic plasticity of functional and fitness-related traits of a genotype determine the responses to global change factors; (4) genotypes with high plasticity to environmental drivers may acclimate or even vastly expand their ranges, genotypes of medium plasticity must acclimate or experience range-shifts, and those with low plasticity may face local extinction; (5) responses to ancillary types of global change, like shifting levels of soil salinity, flooding, and drought, are not consistent within lineages and depend on adaptation of individual genotypes. These patterns suggest that the diverse lineages of P. australis will undergo intense selective pressure in the face of global change such that the distributions and interactions of co-occurring lineages, as well as those of genotypes within-lineages, are very likely to be altered. We propose that the strong latitudinal clines within and between P. australis lineages can be a useful tool for predicting plant responses to climate change in general and present a conceptual framework for using P. australis lineages to predict plant responses to global change and its consequences.

AB The Mexican Garter Snake (Thamnophis eques) is a terrestrial-aquatic generalist that feeds on both aquatic and terrestrial prey. We describe size-related variation and sexual variation in the diet of T. eques through analysis of 262 samples of identifiable stomach contents in snakes from 23 locations on the Mexican Plateau. The snake T. eques we studied consumed mostly fish, followed in lesser amounts by leeches, earthworms, frogs, and tadpoles. Correspondence analysis suggested that the frequency of consumption of various prey items differed between the categories of age but not between sex of snakes, and the general pattern was a reduction of prey item diversity with size of snake. Snake length was correlated positively with mass of ingested prey. Large snakes consumed large prey and continued to consume smaller prey. In general, no differences were found between the prey taxa of male and female snakes, although males ate two times more tadpoles than females. Males and females did not differ in the mass of leeches, earthworms, fishes, frogs and tadpoles that they ate, and males and females that ate each prey taxon were similar in length. We discuss proximate and functional determinants of diet and suggest that the observed intraspecific variation in T. eques could be explored by temporal variation in prey availability, proportions of snake size classes and possible sexual dimorphism in head traits and prey dimensions to assess the role of intersexual resource competition.

AB Algal turf scrubber (ATS) systems have been evaluated for their ability to remove dissolved nutrients from a variety of natural waters and agricultural wastewaters. Although these systems have been well characterized with respect to productivity and nutrient removal, very little is known about the community structure and population dynamics of the underlying algal community. The objectives of this study are to describe the nutrient removal performance of a pilot-scale ATS adjacent to the Susquehanna River along with a detailed analysis of structure of the algal turf community. ATS biomass production varied seasonally, with highest values in July and August. Total production ranged from 11 to 18 g DW m(-2) day(-1) with a mean of 12.3 +/- 1.6 g DW m(-2) day(-1) over the eight month growing season, Average N and P removal rates fluctuated more than 2-fold with highest values (350450 mg N m(-2) d(-1)and 2540 mg P m(-2) d(-1)) during the two month summer period (July/August) and lowest values (3050 mg N m(-2) d(-1)and 35 mg P m(-2) d(-1)) in the early winter period (November/December). Results show high species diversity within the scrubber (182 species within the 28 m(2) growing surface). High diversity is likely due to a combination of factors: species diversity in the source community (the Susquehanna River), spatial heterogeneity of the ATS system, and vertical structure of the turf community. Analysis for traits for mode of attachment, habitat of origin and life form was used to illustrate the distribution of adaptations of species in the algal turf community.

AB Our study concerns the sampling of patches of mobile gravel and pebbles at 14 stations (25 to 66 mwater depth) in an area of hard bottom located in the ` Raz Blanchard' (between Cap de La Hague in France and Alderney in the Channel Islands, UK). The samples collected from these benthic habitats with scattered fauna were sieved on 1 mm mesh and subjected to meticulous sorting, revealing the presence of a highly diversified mobile fauna. The epifauna and vagile macrofauna (> 1 mm) account for 140 taxa (120 species, 17 genera and three other levels of identification). Amphipods and polychaetes dominate the taxonomic richness, while crustaceans represent 75% of the fauna. Among these taxa, two species are new for the English Channel marine fauna. Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) indicates that the species show adaptation to such strong hydrodynamic conditions, owing to their small size which allows them to live in interstitial environments and on biological substrates, and which can locally modify the hydrodynamic conditions.

AB Functional classification based on species traits brought a revolution in community ecology, and also boosted phytoplankton and in phytobenton (diatom) research. Several studies stressed the usefulness of phytoplankton functional groups in ecological status assessment, and there is also a strong emphasis to use combined traits in ecological assessments of diatom assemblages. The Combined Eco-Morphological Functional Groups (CEMFGs) help to reveal species-environmental correlations, which can be hidden, controlling traits separately. Nowadays, there are three types of functional guild classifications simultaneously used in the literature: (i) the original classification proposed by Passy (0); (ii) Passy's classification complemented with a separated planktic guild (P); (iii) the refined guild classification by Rimet and Bouchez, also containing the planktic guild (RB). One of the most important criteria of the combined functional groups is the well-defined ecological frame of these combined groups; thus it is vital to harmonise the classification of the taxa into guild based combined eco-morphological functional groups (CEMFGs). In this study we tested the similarities and dissimilarities of the correlations between environmental factors and CEMFGs created in the (i)-(iii) classifications. Samples were collected in 138 sampling sites on lowland rivers and streams in the Hungarian Lowland Region. Strong correlations were anticipated between the functional groups and environmental factors due to the presence of common and/or abundant planktic taxa. Our results validated the necessity of a separated planktic guild in ecological assessments of diatom assemblages. Further relevant differences between the correlations of CEMFGs-P or CEMFGs-RB and abiotic factors were hypothesised in the case of those functional groups which contained reassigned taxa with high frequency and/or abundance. Our results confirmed this hypothesis. Furthermore, the present study also highlighted the relevance of well-defined trait classification. Abundant and/or frequent taxa, which are able to change their life forms, can modify significantly the relationship between the functional group containing them and environmental factors. In the future, both field and laboratory studies should focus on revealing the circumstances, which cause the mentioned changes in traits of diatoms.

AB Large scale palm oil plantations for the production of vegetable oil are among the most harmful agricultural activities to biodiversity, especially given 'their rapid expansion, worldwide. Many cases of species loss have already been recorded in Asian countries, although research is still incipient in the Amazon basin, and the environmental impacts of these monocultures on freshwater ecosystems in the Neotropical region are still poorly understood. The present study evaluated the effects of oil palm plantations on the physical structure of stream habitats and the resulting changes in the taxonomic and functional composition of aquatic insect communities. A total of 2100 specimens of the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera were collected during the present study, representing 40 genera and 16 families. The hypothesis tested was that the taxonomic and functional diversity of the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (Insecta) decreases in streams surrounded by oil palm plantations in comparison with those embedded in forested areas. In the plantation streams, the taxonomic richness and composition, and the functional richness are modified significantly. Functional composition appeared unaltered despite reduced canopy cover associated with oil palm streams. These effects emphasize the importance of the riparian vegetation for the protection of the aquatic communities found in oil palm plantations. The maintenance of the riparian vegetation may mitigate the impacts of plantations, contributing to the conservation of insect communities and associated biodiversity.

AB The amphipod genus Niphargus comprises hundreds of eyeless and depigmented species with narrow ranges in Western Palaearctic subterranean freshwaters. Niphargus hrabei and N. valachicus, two morphologically and ecologically similar species, are atypical due to their epigean lifestyle and large ranges. Given their wide and largely sympatric distributions, we explored their potential ecological niche overlap by comparing morphological functional traits, patterns of co-occurrence and habitat selection, and tested for cryptic diversity by examining variation of mitochondrial and nuclear markers in selected populations. Mitochondrial sequences and the presence of shared nuclear alleles among individuals collected along the study area did not support the existence of cryptic lineages; two other Niphargus species described in the past from Hungary seem to be their younger synonyms. Except for body size, both species were morphologically similar and seem only weakly differentiated ecologically. Though smaller in size, N. hrabei is ecologically more tolerant, while N. valachicus might be a superior competitor due to its larger size. Despite large-scale sympatry, co-occurrence of both species was rare. Their present distributions may result from a dynamic relationship between dispersal ability and competitive strength. These widespread and euryoecious Niphargus species demonstrate that the genus may be successful not only in the subterranean realm but also in various surface waters.

AB Community ecology has broadened considerably with the recognition that it is not only at the species-level data where biological patterns and their determinants should be studied. Rather, also functional and phylogenetic data should be examined, as they may provide important information for both basic ecology and applied fields such as conservation and bioassessment. We thus explored the distance decay of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic community compositions along spatial and environmental gradients within a boreal lake metacommunity. We used distance-based methods (i.e., Mantel test, Mantel correlograms and db-RDA) to examine different facets (i.e., taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) and components (i.e., total, turnover and nestedness-resultant) in relation to spatial and environmental variables. We found that the species compositions of lake benthic invertebrate communities varied mostly along environmental gradients, but were also weakly related to spatial distances between lakes. We also showed that functional and phylogenetic compositions were solely related to environmental variation across the lakes, but these relationships were generally weak. Our exploration of different facets and components of beta diversity added to the knowledge of lake invertebrate communities by adding functional and phylogenetic views, which has rarely been done in studies of aquatic metacommunities. Such information is also important in valuing lakes for conservation and bioassessment because it is not only at the species-level data where ecological patterns and underlying mechanisms should be explored.

AB The benthic macroinvertebrate fauna and main abiotic parameters were studied to understand the patterns of diversity and structure along the temporal and longitudinal gradients in two tropical lotic ecosystems in the wet and dry zones of Sri Lanka. Invertebrate abundance (annual means) was in the same magnitude in the two streams (2,520ind.m(-2) in the wet zone stream and 2,940ind.m(-2) in the dry zone stream). Both streams had similar annual mean diversity levels measured as Shannon diversity (Eswathu Oya (wet zone)=2.11; Yan Oya (dry zone)=2.07), with a mean annual evenness (Pielou evenness) of 0.56 +/- 0.14 for Eswathu Oya and 0.60 +/- 0.09 for Yan Oya. Along the longitudinal gradient, abundance and taxa richness increased toward the lower reaches in the wet zone stream but decreased in the dry zone stream. Composition of functional feeding groups was greatly influenced by abiotic factors in the temporal gradient than in the longitudinal gradient. This was possibly due to the seasonal patterns of flow regimes, and allochthonous nutrient inputs into the streams. Hence, resource management and conservation as well as attempts of ecological assessment in tropical streams should be based not only on the in-stream characteristics but also on the catchment properties.

AB Evolutionary ecologists aim to explain and predict evolutionary change under different selective regimes. Theory suggests that such evolutionary prediction should be more difficult for biomechanical systems in which different trait combinations generate the same functional output: many-to-one mapping. Many-to-one mapping of phenotype to function enables multiple morphological solutions to meet the same adaptive challenges. Therefore, many-to-one mapping should undermine parallel morphological evolution, and hence evolutionary predictability, even when selection pressures are shared among populations. Studying 16 replicate pairs of lake- and stream-adapted threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), we quantified three parts of the teleost feeding apparatus and used biomechanical models to calculate their expected functional outputs. The three feeding structures differed in their form-to-function relationship from one-to-one (lower jaw lever ratio) to increasingly many-to-one (buccal suction index, opercular 4-bar linkage). We tested for (1) weaker linear correlations between phenotype and calculated function, and (2) less parallel evolution across lake-stream pairs, in the many-to-one systems relative to the one-to-one system. We confirm both predictions, thus supporting the theoretical expectation that increasing many-to-one mapping undermines parallel evolution. Therefore, sole consideration of morphological variation within and among populations might not serve as a proxy for functional variation when multiple adaptive trait combinations exist.

AB In the south-eastern United States and globally, increasing human water demand coupled with climate change is diminishing stream flows and increasing stream intermittency in many watersheds. We characterized benthic invertebrate assemblages across a stream flow gradient ranging from intermittent to perennial following a multiyear drought by examining the functional traits that can influence assemblage response to drying. We sampled 13 reaches within the Lower Flint River Basin in south-western Georgia, from September to December 2013. Reaches included perennial, near-perennial (ceased flowing but maintained a wetted channel during drought), intermittent-dry (seasonally dry), and intermittent-frequent (frequently dry). Distinct assemblages were documented across this gradient. Reaches that dried during the drought had a lower richness of aquatic insects, especially Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa, partly due to inadequate time for life cycle completion and lack of adaptations to avoid drying. Intermittent reaches also included abundant and unique noninsect taxa such as Gammarus spp. and Isopoda. Projected trends towards increased water demand and drought severity and frequency in the south-eastern United States will magnify shifts towards dominance by drought-tolerant taxa as greater portions of stream networks become intermittent.

AB The effectiveness of organic farming for promoting biodiversity has been widely documented, yet most studies have been undertaken in temperate agroecosystems with a focus on birds, insects and plants. Despite the Mediterranean basin being a biodiversity hotspot for conservation priorities, the potential benefits of organic farming for biodiversity there has received little attention. Here, we assessed the effect of farming system, landscape characteristics and habitat structure on biodiversity in Mediterranean vineyards using two taxa with different functional traits (in terms of mobility, dispersal ability and home range size): bats and arachnids. We also tested the "intermediate landscape-complexity" hypothesis, which predicts that local conservation measures have greatest success in landscapes of intermediate complexity. Our study design involved pairs of matched organic and conventional vineyard plots in the south of France situated along a landscape complexity gradient. Abundance of arachnids were higher in organic vineyards, although arachnid species richness was positively associated with the amount of ground vegetation cover. Organic farming was ineffective on its own to enhance bat activity and species richness regardless of the landscape context. Rather, our results suggested that landscape features were more important for bats than vineyard management, with significantly higher bat activity recorded on vineyard plots located at close proximity to hedgerows and rivers. When designing conservation strategies in Mediterranean farmlands, we strongly recommend the implementation of a multi-scale approach to assure benefits for a wide range of species.

AB The degradation of ecosystems is often associated with losses of large organisms and the concomitant losses of the ecological functions they mediate. Conversely, the resilience of ecosystems to stress is strongly influenced by faunal communities and their impacts on processes. Denitrification in coastal sediments is a process that may provide ecosystem resilience to eutrophication by removing excess bioavailable nitrogen. Here, we conducted a large-scale field experiment to test the effect of macrofaunal community composition on denitrification in response to two levels of nutrient enrichment at 28 sites across a biologically heterogeneous sandflat. After 7 weeks of enrichment, we measured denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) along with benthic macrofaunal community composition and environmental variables. We normalised treatment site specific DEA values by those in ambient sediments (DEA(CN)) to reveal the underlying response across the heterogeneous landscape. Nutrient enrichment caused reductions in DEA(CN) as well as functional changes in the community; these were both more pronounced under the highest level of nutrient loading (on average DEA(CN) was reduced by 34%). The degree of suppression of DEA(CN) following moderate nitrogen loading was mitigated by a key bioturbating species, but following high nitrogen loading (which reduced the key species density) the abundance and diversity of other nutrient processing species were the most important factors alleviating negative effects. This study provides a prime example of the context-dependent role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem functioning, underlining that different elements of biodiversity can become important as stress levels increase. Our results emphasise that management and conservation strategies require a real-world understanding of the community attributes that facilitate nutrient processing and maintain resilience in coastal ecosystems.

AB 1. During the last couple of decades, invasive species have become a worldwide problem in many freshwater systems. Besides higher plants and animals, microbes, in particular the potentially toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, has attracted increasing attention, due to its spread towards temperate zones of the northern and southern hemisphere. A number of advantageous functional traits and a high intraspecific plasticity have been suggested to explain its invasion success.
   2. The aim of this study was to examine intraspecific functional trait variability in 12 different isolates of C.raciborskii originating from different lakes in an invaded region in Northeast Germany. We measured growth rate, C:N:P ratios, chlorophyll-a content and the abundance of heterocysts under nutrient-replete and phosphorus-limited conditions. Moreover, the isolate-specific morphology and grazing losses by an herbivorous rotifer, as a top-down force, were studied.
   3. DNA fingerprinting revealed that all isolates were genetically different. C.raciborskii exhibited a large variability in all measured traits among isolates. The C:P, N:P and Chl-a:C ratios differed by a factor of two or more. The trait variability among isolates was higher under nutrient-replete conditions, except for the C:P ratio, which varied most during phosphorus limitation. The susceptibility to grazing, calculated as maximum ingestion rates of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus on C.raciborskii, varied most among isolates, but was not related to any of the measured physiological or morphological traits, i.e. no trade-off was found.
   4. Ecological and genetic clustering did not match, indicating that the genetic relationship based on DNA fingerprinting did not cover ecological differences.
   5. Our results show a high trait variability within locally occurring and partly co-occurring C.raciborskii isolates. No overall trade-offs between the measured functional traits were found. This demonstrates the ecological relevance of linking multiple traits, e.g. competitive and consumptive. Furthermore, this study emphasises the importance of analysing more than one strain of a species, as different strains show different trait values potentially relevant for their invasibility and the field of general trait-based ecology.

AB 1. A challenge to understanding ecosystem processes is that the functional roles of species are linked with the demography of populations. In many systems, and particularly on coral reefs, the dynamics and structure of populations of many functionally important species has significantly changed over recent decades due to a variety of disturbances, and the changes in the ecological processes mediated by them are poorly understood.
   2. Benthic suspension feeders are allogenic ecosystem engineers that contribute to the flow of materials and energy in aquatic systems. There is increasing evidence that sponges dominate this functional group on Caribbean reefs. Using demographic data from 2000 to 2012 and measurements of filtration rates of particulate and dissolved organic carbon, we parameterized a stage-based matrix model of population-mediated carbon flux for the Caribbean giant barrel sponge Xestospongia muta on Conch Reef, Florida Keys, to investigate the demographic mechanisms that mediate changes in benthic-pelagic coupling.
   3. Population-mediated carbon flux increased over time with increasing sponge density and volume, with the largest individuals making the greatest contribution. Elasticity analysis revealed that the growth of sponges in all stages, the survival of sponges in the two largest stages, and the production of new recruits by the largest sponges had the greatest influence on changes in population-mediated carbon flux. We estimate the mean carbon flux over 2000-2012 for X. muta at Conch Reef was 1575 mg C days(-1) m(-2), a value that exceeds that of any other single-species rate.
   4. Projections indicated that population-mediated carbon flux will continue to increase under present conditions; thus, X. muta is expected to play an even larger role in the transfer of carbon from the water column to the benthos on Caribbean coral reefs.
   5. Rather than being fixed, the functional role of species within a community are often dynamic and influenced by the demography of populations. The general framework developed here, a conversion of the basic unit of measurement for population models (i.e. the individual) into quantifiable metrics of species traits or activities, may be more broadly applied by further efforts to examine interrelationships between population and ecosystem processes.

AB 1. Trait-based approaches evaluate ecosystem functioning under environmental change by relating traits predicting changes in species densities (response traits) to traits driving ecosystem functioning (effect traits). Stressors can, however, affect ecosystem functioning not only by altering species densities but also by directly changing species effect traits.
   2. We first identified the response traits predicting the cell density of 18 marine benthic diatom strains along gradients of two chemical stressors (a pesticide and a metal, atrazine and copper). We then tested if response traits could predict stressor-induced changes in ecosystem functioning, i.e. changes in the effect traits driving the diatoms' potential contribution to primary production, sediment stabilization and energy content in intertidal systems. Finally, we examined if changes in density and changes in ecosystem functioning were correlated, to assess whether species capable of growing under stressful conditions could maintain their contribution to ecosystem functioning.
   3. The relationship between response traits and stressor-induced changes in density and ecosystem functioning was different depending on stressor type: a set of intercorrelated morphological traits predicted changes in both density and ecosystem functioning under metal stress, with large cells being more stress resistant. Changes in density and changes in ecosystem functioning were positively related: diatoms whose density was least affected by the metal were also able to sustain functioning under metal exposure.
   4. In contrast, the capacity for mixotrophic growth predicted changes in density, but not changes in ecosystem functioning under pesticide stress. Pesticide effects on density and on ecosystem functioning were negatively related for energy content and sediment stabilization, indicating a limited capacity of pesticide-tolerant diatoms to maintain their contribution to ecosystem functioning.
   5. Synthesis. Ecosystem functioning under stress can depend on whether the response traits driving changes in species densities also predict direct stress effects on the species' contribution to functioning. Based on our results, we expect a disproportionate loss of functioning when traits driving species densities do not allow to maintain ecosystem functioning under stress.

AB Understanding the origin and maintenance of functionally important subordinate traits is a major goal of evolutionary physiologists and ecomorphologists. Within the confines of a limbless body plan, snakes are diverse in terms of body size and ecology, but we know little about the functional traits that underlie this diversity. We used a phylogenetically diverse group of 131 snake species to examine associations between habitat use, sidewinding locomotion and constriction behaviour with the number of body vertebrae spanned by a single segment of the spinalis muscle, with total numbers of body vertebrae used as a covariate in statistical analyses. We compared models with combinations of these predictors to determine which best fit the data among all species and for the advanced snakes only (N=114). We used both ordinary least-squares models and phylogenetic models in which the residuals were modelled as evolving by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Snakes with greater numbers of vertebrae tended to have spinalis muscles that spanned more vertebrae. Habitat effects dominated models for analyses of all species and advanced snakes only, with the spinalis length spanning more vertebrae in arboreal species and fewer vertebrae in aquatic and burrowing species. Sidewinding specialists had shorter muscle lengths than nonspecialists. The relationship between prey constriction and spinalis length was less clear. Differences among clades were also strong when considering all species, but not for advanced snakes alone. Overall, these results suggest that muscle morphology may have played a key role in the adaptive radiation of snakes.

AB The studies of functional structure of high-Arctic Ecosystems are scarce. We used data on benthic macrofauna from 500-km latitudinal transect in the eastern Laptev Sea, from the Lena delta to the continental shelf break, to describe spatial patterns in species composition, taxonomic and functional structure in relation to environmental factors. Both taxonomy-based approach and Biological Trait analysis yielded similar results and showed general depth-related gradient in benthic diversity and composition. This congruence between taxonomical and functional dimensions of community organization suggests that the same environmental factors (primarily riverine input and regime of sedimentation) have similar effect on both community structure and functioning. BTA also revealed a distinct functional structure of stations situated at the Eastern Lena valley, with dominance of motile, burrowing sub-surface deposit-feeders and absence of sedentary tube-dwelling forms. The overall spatial distribution of benthic assemblages corresponds well to that described there in preceding decades, evidencing the long-term stability of bottom ecosystem. Strong linear relationship between species and traits diversity, however, indicates low functional redundancy, which potentially makes the ecosystem susceptible to a species loss or structural shifts.

In this study, we assessed the predictive power of lake morphometry, physical and chemical conditions of the water, and zooplankton density in relation to phytoplankton taxonomic and functional diversity in Amazonian floodplain lakes during low- and high-water periods. We also examined to what extent taxonomic and functional indexes were coupled. Taxonomic diversity was evaluated by species richness and Shannon index, and functional diversity by functional richness (FRic) and community-weighted mean trait value (CWM). The relative importance of predictive factors was evaluated by model selection, multi-model inference and correlations. We found that phytoplankton taxonomic and functional diversity indexes were mostly related to the same factors within the low- and high-water periods. Total phosphorus was the main driving factor in the low water, while euphotic zone depth and zooplankton density were the main driving factors in the high water. Taxonomic and functional diversity indexes were weakly coupled in the low water, but strongly coupled in the high water. Our results highlight that phytoplankton taxonomic and functional diversity can differ between periods, but respond similarly to environmental driving factors.

AB Background: Ferrous iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) at high concentration in the soil cause heavy metal toxicity and greatly affect rice yield and quality. To improve rice production, understanding the genetic and molecular resistance mechanisms to excess Fe and Zn in rice is essential. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an effective way to identify loci and favorable alleles governing Fe and Zn toxicty as well as dissect the genetic relationship between them in a genetically diverse population.
   Results: A total of 29 and 31 putative QTL affecting shoot height (SH), root length (RL), shoot fresh weight (SFW), shoot dry weight (SDW), root dry weight (RDW), shoot water content (SWC) and shoot ion concentrations (SFe or SZn) were identified at seedling stage in Fe and Zn experiments, respectively. Five toxicity tolerance QTL (qSdw3a, qSdw3b, qSdw12 and qSFe5 / qSZn5) were detected in the same genomic regions under the two stress conditions and 22 candidate genes for 10 important QTL regions were also determined by haplotype analyses.
   Conclusion: Rice plants share partial genetic overlaps of Fe and Zn toxicity tolerance at seedling stage. Candidate genes putatively affecting Fe and Zn toxicity tolerance identified in this study provide valuable information for future functional characterization and improvement of rice tolerance to Fe and Zn toxicity by marker-assisted selection or designed QTL pyramiding.

AB Functional diversity based on species traits is a powerful tool to investigate how changes in species richness and composition affect ecosystem functioning. However, studies aimed at understanding changes in functional diversity over large temporal and spatial scales are still scant. Here we evaluate the combined effect of diversification and species sorting on functional diversity of fossil marine gastropods during the Pliocene-Quaternary transition in the Pacific coast of South America. We analyzed a total of 172 species in 29 Pliocene and 97 Quaternary sites. Each species was characterized according to six functional traits: body size, feeding type, mobility, attachment, life-habit, and larval mode. Functional diversity was estimated according to four indexes (functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion) based on functional traits measured. Extrapolated species richness showed a slight yet not significant decrease from the Pliocene to the Quaternary despite the fact that a large faunal turnover took place; furthermore, a large extinction of Pliocene species (61-76%) was followed by a high pulse of appearances (49-56%) during the Quaternary. Three out of four indices of functional diversity (evenness, divergence and dispersion) increased significantly towards the Quaternary which is more than expected under a random turnover of species. The increase in functional diversity is associated with a loss of large-sized carnivore forms, which tended to be replaced by small-sized grazers. Hence, this trait-selective species turnover, even in the absence of significant changes in species richness, likely had a large effect and has shaped the functional diversity of present-day assemblages.

AB Patterns of distribution of reef fishes were examined across three spatial scales and related to habitat traits along 25 km of the northern Portuguese coast. Response variables included the multivariate assemblage structure, the total number of taxa and individuals, and the abundance of single groups categorized according to their preference for the benthic, proximo-benthic or pelagic environment, feeding and reproductive behaviour. Habitat traits included topographic elements (small and large 'drops' like cracks and crevices) and the extent of dominant morpho-functional types of macroalgae (kelp, large foliose, small erect, turf-forming filamentous, and encrusting). All fish responses were characterized by the largest variance at the smallest scale (among transects tens m apart), followed by that among reefs (hundreds m to 1 km apart) and almost null variance among sites (some km apart). Small and large 'drops' of the substratum explained, respectively, considerable variation of assemblage structure and the total abundance of individuals, while the extent of bare rock influenced the richness of taxa and that of benthic fishes, fishes feeding on sessile invertebrates and fishes laying benthic eggs or having nesting behaviour. Combinations of abiotic and biotic structural attributes of reefs influenced proximo-benthic fishes, the predators of mobile animals and fishes releasing pelagic eggs. The here reported associations between patterns of distribution of reef fishes and habitat traits have implications for the design of future protection schemes suitable to guarantee the conservation of reef fish communities and of the processes responsible for their variation. Within the SLOSS (single-large vs. several-small) debate in the design of marine reserves, for example, effective protection to the studied reef fishes would be provided by a set of small reserves, rather than a single large which might be appropriate for fishes having wider home ranges.

AB The degree to which terrestrial vertebrate populations are depleted in tropical forests occupied by human communities has been the subject of an intense polarising debate that has important conservation implications. Conservation ecologists and practitioners are divided over the extent to which community-based subsistence offtake is compatible with ecologically functional populations of tropical forest game species. To quantify depletion envelopes of forest vertebrates around human communities, we deployed a total of 383 camera trap stations and 78 quantitative interviews to survey the peri-community areas controlled by 60 semi-subsistence communities over a combined area of over 3.2 million hectares in the Medio Jurua and Uatuma regions of Central-Western Brazilian Amazonia. Our results largely conform with prior evidence that hunting large-bodied vertebrates reduces wildlife populations near settlements, such that they are only found at a distance to settlements where they are hunted less frequently. Camera trap data suggest that a select few harvest-sensitive species, including lowland tapir, are either repelled or depleted by human communities. Nocturnal and cathemeral species were detected relatively more frequently in disturbed areas close to communities, but individual species did not necessarily shift their activity patterns. Group biomass of all species was depressed in the wider neighbourhood of urban areas rather than communities. Interview data suggest that species traits, especially group size and body mass, mediate these relationships. Large-bodied, large-group-living species are detected farther from communities as reported by experienced informants. Long-established communities in our study regions have not "emptied" the surrounding forest. Low human population density and low hunting offtake due to abundant sources of alternative aquatic protein, suggest that these communities represent a best-case scenario for sustainable hunting of wildlife for food, thereby providing a conservative assessment of game depletion. Given this 'best-case' camera trap and interview-based evidence for hunting depletion, regions with higher human population densities, external trade in wildlife and limited access to alternative protein will likely exhibit more severe depletion.

AB Variations in abundance and diversity of estuarine benthic macrofauna are typically described along the salinity gradient. The influence of gradients in water depth, hydrodynamic energy and sediment properties are less well known. We studied how these variables influence the distribution of subtidal macrofauna in the polyhaline zone of a temperate estuary (Westerschelde, SW Netherlands). Macrofauna density, biomass and species richness, combined in a so-called ecological richness, decreased with current velocities and median grain-size and increased with organic carbon of the sediment, in total explaining 39% of the variation. The macrofauna community composition was less well explained by the three environmental variables (approx. 12-15% in total, with current velocity explaining approx. 8%). Salinity, water depth and distance to the intertidal zone had a very limited effect on both ecological richness and the macrofauna community. The proportion of (surface) deposit feeders (including opportunistic species), decreased relative to that of omnivores and carnivores with increasing current velocity and sediment grain-size. In parallel, the proportion of burrowing sessile benthic species decreased relative to that of mobile benthic species that are able to swim. Correspondingly, spatial variations in hydrodynamics yielded distinct hotspots and coldspots in ecological richness. The findings highlight the importance of local hydrodynamic conditions for estuarine restoration and conservation. The study provides a tool based on a hydrodynamic model to assess and predict ecological richness in estuaries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to observe and predict trawling-induced patterns at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to inform realistic management strategies is a challenge which scientists have consistently faced in recent decades. Here, we use fish feeding behaviour, a biological trait easily impaired by trawling disturbance, to depict alterations in fish condition (i.e. individual fitness) and feeding opportunities. The benthivorous fish Mullus barbatus barbatus was selected as a model species. The observed trends of responses to trawling in prey species confirmed the effectiveness of a non-trawled zone in sustaining higher levels of diet diversity (e.g. quantity and quality of ingested prey) and fish condition values (e.g. morphometric and physiological Condition Index). Changes observed in fish prey selection confirmed the role of trawling disturbance in modifying the local soft bottoms community, producing alterations of prey availability that trigger shifts in fish diet. Trawling-induced feeding patterns, mirrored through stomach contents, can positively or negatively affect fish condition, the main driver of population dynamics in maintaining carrying capacity levels. Due to the widespread socio-economic value of the red mullet fishery, and the current exploitation status, evidence gathered by the proposed bottom-up trait based approach might inform future trawling adaptation strategies, and tailor spatial conservation measures supporting an Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management.

AB This paper first reviews the concept of functional diversity in general terms and then applies it to free-living aquatic ciliates. Ciliates are extremely versatile organisms and display an enormous functional diversity as key elements of pelagic food webs, acting as predators of bacteria, algae, other protists and even some metazoans. Planktonic ciliates are important food for zooplankton, and mixotrophic and functionally autotrophic species may significantly contribute to primary production in the ocean and in lakes. The co-occurrence of many ciliate species in seemingly homogenous environments indicates a wide range of their ecological niches. Variation in space and time may foster co-occurrence and prevent violating the competitive exclusion principle among ciliates using the same resources. Considering that many ciliates may be dormant and/or rare in many habitats, ciliate species diversity must be higher than can be deduced from simple sampling techniques; molecular methods of identification clearly point to this hidden diversity. From a functional point of view, the question is how much of this diversity represents redundancy. A key challenge for future research is to link the ecophysiological performance of naturally co-occurring ciliates to their functional genes. To this end, more experimental research is needed with with functionally different species. (C) 2017 The Author. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB Anthropogenic stress has been identified as main driver of freshwater biodiversity loss. Adverse effects on the biodiversity of freshwater organisms, such as macroinvertebrates, may propagate to associated ecosystem functions, such as organic matter breakdown (OMB). In this context, the functional diversity (FD) of communities has been suggested to be a more suitable predictor of changes in ecosystem functions than taxonomic diversity (TD). We investigated the response of TD and FD of invertebrate communities to an environmental stress gradient and the relation of both metrics to the rate of organic matter breakdown. For this, we sampled macroinvertebrates and determined OMB using leaf bags along an environmental stress gradient (i.e. changes in physicochemical and hydromorphological conditions) in 29 low-order streams. Taxonomic richness decreased with increasing environmental stress (r = -0.55) but was not related to OMB. Conversely, the Simpson diversity of communities was not associated with the gradient but correlated moderately (r = 0.41) with OMB. Of three functional diversity indices (functional richness, evenness and divergence), only functional richness correlated moderately with the stress gradient (r = 0.41) and any of the indices correlated with OMB. Nevertheless, functional metrics such as specific trait modalities and the total abundance of the dominant shredders correlated higher (r = 0.46 and 0.48) with OMB than the TD indices. Given a relatively small species pool in our study and methodical constraints such as the limited resolution of autecological information, the FD might perform better in other contexts and if focusing on response and effect traits for the stressor and ecosystem function under scrutiny, respectively.

AB Variation in phytoplankton functional diversity is partioned and mapped using several indices and linkage methods based on dendrograms. The relationships between diversity metrics and major environmental predictors, including zooplankton density, were assessed in 29 phytoplankton communities of floodplain lakes distributed along the Middle Araguaia River in central Brazil. The dendrogram-based functional diversity indices were Functional Group Richness, Functional Diversity, Mean Pairwise Distance and Mean Nearest Taxon Distance, whereas seven different hierarchical agglomerative linkage methods we used. The performance of indices were compared using ANOVA and their spatial variation in response to major environmental predictors evaluated. The results indicate that variation in functional diversity values is primarily a product of the type of index chosen. This variation was statistically significant in 90 % of the floodplain lakes studied; however, a spatial pattern of variation in index values along the river was not detected. Furthermore, environmental constraints, including zooplankton density, were weak predictors of functional diversity indices. Therefore, the mathematical characteristics of indices are of primary importance in explaining variation among functional diversity values.

AB Riparian systems are threatened globally, but contribute disproportionately to biodiversity and ecosystem function. Restoration to reverse their loss is costly, and requires careful monitoring and evaluation. Odonates are amongst the most reliable arthropod bio-indicators for monitoring riparian ecosystems. Despite functional diversity (FD) reflecting ecosystem pattern and processes better than taxonomic diversity, Odonate FD has yet to be used in evaluating riparian conservation and restoration outcomes. We surveyed 45 sites across six river systems in northeastern South Africa, to compare Odonate FD and standardised effect size of Odonate FD (sesFD) in riparian systems that had been invaded by alien plants, cleared of alien invasives, and sites that had never been invaded (15 sites each). Although species richness did not differ between treatments, Odonate sesFD was lower in invaded sites than those that had been cleared of alien riparian vegetation and those that had never been invaded. Clearance of 40% of alien riparian vegetation was associated with sesFD greater than that of invaded sites by almost two standard deviations. Representation of traits varied between treatments but was similar between cleared and natural sites, suggesting that invasion by alien plants directly impacts food webs, and that clearance can restore ecosystem processes and ecological services. This study confirms that Odonate FD can respond to restoration efforts. Secondary impacts of restoration to complete suites of functional groups can be anticipated to enhance ecological services and impact food webs at a range of scales.

AB In this paper, we present the results of new archaeological and geological research carried out in SHK Extension, a new site excavated within the SHK fluvial complex (Bed II, Olduvai Gorge). The paper describes the stratigraphy of the site and its correlation with our excavation in SHK Main Site, showing that overbank archaeological accumulations in both areas are synchronous and form part of the same fluvial palaeo-landscape. On the basis of the archaeo-stratigraphical analysis performed, mainly geared towards defining high-resolution chrono-stratigraphical frameworks within the deposit, we report the results of a technological study of the lithic collection sorted by archaeo-units, an assessment of the integrity of the main accumulation and an exhaustive lithic refitting programme. The archaeological sequence at SHK Extension, consisting of three archaeo-units, preserves a high-density patch of lithics andfossil bones (Level B2), onan overbank setting, isochronous with the SHK Main site. The high percentage of small lithic remains and bones, large number of fresh archaeological materials, and the identification of several refit sets support the integrity of the anthropogenic accumulation documented in Level B2. The main technological trait of the lithic assemblage from this level is the preservation of a qualitatively significant sample of large flakes and LCTs. The technological behaviours observed in SHKE, in the framework of the SHK complex, confirm that the complex web of inter-assemblage variability during Bed II times operated also in very close fractions of the same palaeo-landscape. This reinforces the idea that subtle functional parameters must be taken into account in our current assessment of the Developed Oldowan/Acheulean interface.

AB The organization of functional regions within genomes has important implications for evolutionary potential. Considerable research effort has gone toward identifying the genomic basis of phenotypic traits of interest through quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses. Less research has assessed the arrangement of QTL in the genome within and across species. To investigate the distribution, extent of colocalization, and the synteny of QTL for ecologically relevant traits, we used a comparative genomic mapping approach within and across a range of salmonid species. We compiled 943 QTL from all available species [ lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), rainbow trout (O. mykiss), Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus)]. We developed a novel analytical framework for mapping and testing the distribution of these QTL. We found no correlation between QTL density and gene density at the chromosome level but did at the fine-scale. Two chromosomes were significantly enriched for QTL. We found multiple synteny blocks for morphological, life history, and physiological traits across species, but only morphology and physiology had significantly more than expected. Two or three pairs of traits were significantly colocalized in three species (lake whitefish, coho salmon, and rainbow trout). Colocalization and fine-scale synteny suggest genetic linkage between traits within species and a conserved genetic basis across species. However, this pattern was weak overall, with colocalization and synteny being relatively rare. These findings advance our understanding of the role of genomic organization in the renowned ecological and phenotypic variability of salmonid fishes.

AB Context Studying communities using a trait-based approach has contributed to major advances in the understanding of community assembly mechanisms, but research has primarily focused on the effect of local biotic and abiotic processes on plant assemblages.
   Objectives At the landscape level, we expect that the diversity of trait values (i.e. functional diversity) in plant assemblages is not random because there might be strong environmental constraints occurring as a filter of plant species at this level. We expect that fragmentation, through connectivity loss, may reduce functional diversity by filtering plant dispersal traits within the global pool of species toward those that present the trait values that are the most adapted. We tested this hypothesis at the metacommunity level and focused on ditch plant dispersal traits.
   Methods We characterised the functional diversity of 27 ditch bank metacommunities for three seed traits encompassing the whole dispersal process: production, buoyancy and mass. We computed four connectivity variables based on the ditch networks surrounding each metacommunity. Null models were designed to quantify functional convergence (i.e. convergence of the trait values around a mean) or divergence for each trait (i.e. dissimilarity in plant trait values).
   Results At the metacommunity level, we demonstrate that (1) connectivity loss reduces the functional diversity of dispersal traits (seed production and seed buoyancy), leading to the convergence of trait values, whereas more connected landscapes promote randomness, or even divergence (seed mass) in trait values; (2) these changes are due to the modification in the number of occurrence of plant species over the nine local communities sampled, rather than in species identity.
   Conclusions Our results indicated that, at the metacommunity level, reduced connectivity acts as a filter on the dispersal traits of plant species, promoting the broad distribution of species with efficient dispersal abilities in such landscapes. Thus, functional diversity helps us to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity.

AB The mineral and biochemical food quality of prey may limit predator production. This well-studied direct bottom-up effect is especially prominent for herbivore-plant interactions. Low-quality prey species, particularly when defended, are generally considered to be less prone to predator-driven extinction. Undefended high-quality prey species sustain high predator production thereby potentially increasing their own extinction risk. The food quality of primary producers is highly species-specific. In communities of competing prey species, predators thus may supplement their diets of low-quality prey with high-quality prey, leading to indirect horizontal interactions between prey species of different food quality. We explore how these predator-mediated indirect interactions affect species coexistence in a general predator-prey model that is parametrized for an experimental algae-rotifer system. To cover a broad range of three essential functional traits that shape many plant-herbivore interactions we consider differences in 1) the food quality of the prey species, 2) their competitive ability for nutrient uptake and 3) their defence against predation. As expected, low food quality of prey can, similarly to defence, provide protection against extinction by predation. Counterintuitively, our simulations demonstrate that being of high food quality also prevents extinction of that prey species and additionally promotes coexistence with a competing, low-quality prey. The persistence of the high-quality prey enables a high conversion efficiency and control of the low-quality prey by the predator and allows for re-allocation of nutrients to the high-quality competitor. Our results show that high food quality is not necessarily detrimental for a prey species but instead can protect against extinction and promote species richness and functional biodiversity.

AB The activities of marine benthic invertebrates link to many ecosystem properties and are often used as an alternative to the direct measurement of ecosystem functioning, such as nutrient cycling. However, links between bioturbation metrics and functional classifications of organisms based on bioturbation mode are rarely tested under a range of circumstances and are commonly assumed to be universally applicable. In this study we examine the effects of particle reworking by the polychaete Hediste diversicolor on the mediation of nutrient concentrations for a range of salinity and sediment algal enrichment levels. Sediment particle reworking increased in the presence of moderate algal enrichment but was reduced at higher levels of algal enrichment and was not affected by salinity. Nutrient concentrations in the water column, however, responded to the independent effects of salinity and algal enrichment. This study demonstrates that variation in particle reworking and mixing activity of H. diversicolor that relate to changes in environmental condition can be sufficient to alter species contributions to ecosystem functioning without altering the mechanistic basis of mediation. Our findings indicate that faunal processes that lead to changes in ecosystem functioning can be differentially expressed in a dynamic environment, and call for more careful consideration in the design and analysis of experiments that attempt to link the functional role of species to ecosystem properties.

AB Due to habitat fragmentation, resource disruption and pollution, urbanization is one of the most destructive forms of anthropization affecting ecosystems worldwide. Generally, human-mediated perturbations dramatically alter species diversity in urban sites compared to the surroundings, thus influencing the functioning of the entire ecosystem. We investigated the taxonomic and functional diversity patterns of the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities in tank bromeliads by comparing those found in a small Neotropical city with those from an adjacent rural site. Changes in the quality of detrital inputs in relation to lower tree diversity and the presence of synanthropic species are likely important driving forces behind the observed structural changes in the urban site. Leaf-litter processors (i.e., shredders, scrapers) were positively affected in the urban site, while filter-feeders that process smaller particles produced by the activity of the shredders were negatively affected. Because we cannot ascertain whether the decline in filter-feeders is related to food web-mediated effects or to competitive exclusion (Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were present in urban bromeliads only), further studies are necessary to account for the effects of intra-guild competition or inter-guild facilitation.

AB QuestionsAbandonment of anthropogenic ecosystems threatens biodiversity in rural areas globally. Successional responses in anthropogenic ecosystems have been shown to differ from those in natural ecosystems because of the legacy of continuous management activities. However, few studies have focused on successional changes in anthropogenic freshwater ecosystems following abandonment. Focusing on two drivers (water depletion and cessation of anthropogenic disturbance), we tested whether water depletion plays a larger role than years since abandonment in determining the both plant functional diversity and composition in farm ponds.
   LocationAwaji Island, western Japan.
   MethodsWe investigated flora at 200 farm ponds, which had experienced long-term continuous anthropogenic disturbance. We interviewed 100 managers of the surveyed ponds and local farmers to identify the ponds' management status. To capture community processes during succession, we focused on functional richness and functional trait composition. We assessed the relative contribution of the two successional drivers in determining functional richness by adopting a linear model. We classified the survey ponds into five groups based on the two successional drivers and performed PERMANOVA to test differences in functional composition among the groups.
   ResultsWater depletion played a larger role than elapsed time since cessation of anthropogenic disturbance in determining functional richness. Functional composition of water-depleted ponds significantly differed from that of managed ponds, regardless of years since abandonment.
   ConclusionsOur results indicate that water depletion has a larger effect on successional changes in ponds than cessation of anthropogenic disturbance; that is, water depletion drives succession and overrides the legacy of continuous anthropogenic disturbance. The results suggest that, in freshwater ecosystems, the functional change in a community is greater in the transition from macrophytes to terrestrial plants than it is in the transition from stress-tolerant species to competitive species.

AB Biological invasions have become one of the most important drivers of biodiversity loss and ecosystem change world-wide. However, it is still unclear how invasions may interact with local abiotic stressors, which are expected to increase as global change intensifies. Furthermore, we know little about the response to biological invasions of insects, despite their disproportionate contribution to global animal biodiversity.
   The aim of the present work is to investigate the impact of an invasive aquatic insect on the co-occurrence patterns of native species of insects along a salinity gradient, and determine which assembly rules are driving these patterns.
   First, we characterised the habitat specialisation and functional niches of each species from physiological and biological traits, respectively, and their degree of overlap. Second, we used field data to compare the co-occurrence patterns of native and invasive species in invaded and non-invaded areas of southern Iberia and northern Morocco. Finally, we tested if habitat filtering or niche differentiation assembly rules mediate their co-occurrence.
   In non-invaded areas, habitat filtering drives habitat segregation of species along the salinity gradient, with a lower contribution of niche differentiation. The presence of the invasive insect modifies the distribution and co-occurrence patterns of native species. In invaded areas, niche differentiation seems to be the main mechanism to avoid competition among the invasive and native species, enabling coexistence and resource partitioning.
   The combined study of functional niche similarity and abiotic stressor tolerance of invasive and native species can improve our understanding of the effects of invasive species along abiotic stress gradients. This approach may increase our capacity to predict the outcomes of biological invasion in a global change context.

AB Fish communities face increasing anthropogenic pressures in freshwater and marine ecosystems that modify their biodiversity and threaten the services they supply to human populations. To address these issues, studies have been increasingly focusing on functions of fish that are linked to their main ecological roles in aquatic ecosystems. Fish are indeed known to control other organisms through predation, mediate nutrient fluxes, and can act as ecosystem engineers. Here for each of the key functions played by fish, we present the functional traits that have already been used to assess them. We include traits measurable from observations on living individuals, morphological features measured on preserved organisms or traits categorized using information from the literature, and we discuss their respective advantages and limitations. We then list future research directions to foster a more complete functional approach for fish ecology that needs to incorporate functional traits describing, food provisioning and cultural services while accounting more frequently for intraspecific variability. Finally, we highlight ecological and evolutionary questions that could be addressed using meta-analyses of large trait databases, and how a trait-based framework could provide valuable insights on the mechanistic links between global changes, functional diversity of fish assemblages, and ecosystem services.

AB Contemporary large-scale river ecology is grounded on the existence of patterns in the distribution of aquatic communities, structured by prevailing abiotic conditions. Here, we investigated the existence of functional consistent associations of traits (i.e., traits appearing consistently together at different sites and the same river type) between different biological elements of the aquatic community, assuming that species traits confer them advantages for certain environmental conditions but also within the aquatic community. If this is true, these trait associations should be consistently found in water bodies with similar characteristics (river types), defining different types of ecosystem functioning. To test this, 79 least-disturbed sites, belonging to five well-defined Portuguese river types and covering the longitudinal river gradient were used: headwaters of semi-arid streams, mountainous streams and northern-Atlantic climate streams, middle reaches and lowland large rivers. For each river type, we analyzed the strongest associations (via the Bray-Curtis coefficient) between diatoms, benthic invertebrates and macrophytes and traits that could be relevant to their interactions (e.g., invertebrate trophic groups, mobility/fixation ability of diatoms, macrophyte affinity to water) against a priori predictions. The strongest associations of traits changed over the river continuum with an increase in their complexity (number of associations) from headwaters to middle reaches and a decrease in lowland large rivers. These changes were not related to total richness, which was similar for all river types and over the continuum (ca. 100 taxa). In the three types of headwaters, there were also clear differences in associations among aquatic elements. The importance of riparian trees in small streams was not as high as expected while instream macrophytes were more relevant than predicted. This study revealed the existence of predictable functional associations that could serve as a basis for the functional assessment of running waters.

AB AimThe functional composition of local assemblages is hypothesized to be controlled by hierarchical environmental filters, whereby the importance of different abiotic and biotic factors varies across both spatial scales and the different dimensions of functional diversity. We examine scale dependence in functional diversity-environment relationships with the ultimate aim of advancing models that predict the response of functional diversity to global change.
   LocationCoral reefs surrounding 23 minimally disturbed central-western Pacific islands.
   Time period2010-2015.
   Major taxa studiedCoral reef fishes.
   MethodsWe surveyed 1,423 reef sites using a standardized monitoring protocol and classified the 547 taxa encountered based on traits related to resource use, body size and behaviour. For each fish community, we calculated species richness and three metrics of functional diversity: functional richness, functional redundancy and functional evenness. We then built nested models at three spatial scales to evaluate the predictive power of environmental conditions over each component of functional diversity.
   ResultsClimatic variables (e.g., primary productivity) and geomorphic context (e.g., bathymetric slope) were more important in predicting functional diversity at coarse spatial scales. In contrast, local measures of habitat quality, including benthic complexity, depth and hard coral cover, were generally most important at finer scales. All diversity metrics were better predicted at coarser scales, but which predictors were important varied among metrics.
   Main conclusionsThe observed scale dependence in environmental predictors of functional diversity generally matches models of hierarchical filters on functional community assembly. Contrary to expectation, however, functional evenness and functional redundancy, which incorporate information on biomass distributions, were not better predicted at finer spatial scales. Instead, broad-scale variation in environmental variables was most important in predicting all components of functional diversity. Furthermore, the distinct responses of each functional diversity metric to environmental variation indicate that each measures a unique dimension of reef-fish diversity, and environmental change may affect each differently.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB In this study, we investigated the genetic variants, including SNPs and indels (short insertions or deletions, less than 50 bp in length), in the genomes and genetic structures of five pig populations (in the northern Taihu Lake region, Jiangsu Province) using the genotyping by genome reducing and sequencing (GGRS) approach. A total of 581 million good reads with an average depth of 11x and an average coverage of 2.16% were used to call variants. In general, 202 106 SNPs and 34 415 indels were obtained, of which 2690 SNPs and 224 indels were capable of inducing protein-coding changes. The genes containing these variants were extracted for functional annotation. The results of gene enrichment analysis revealed that the SNPs under investigation may be associated with reproduction, disease resistance, meat quality and adipose tissue traits, whereas the indels were associated mainly with adipose tissue and disease. Analysis of the genetic structure showed that each population displayed comparable, large differentiations from the others, indicating their uniqueness. In conclusion, the results of our study provide the first genomic overview of the genetic variants and population structures of five Chinese indigenous pig populations.

AB The Reynolds Functional Groups (RFG) classification scheme is an informative and widely used method in ecological studies of freshwater phytoplankton. It clusters species with similar traits, as well as common environmental sensitivities and tolerances. However, researchers face the difficulty to classify species into RFG because it relies in expert opinion, taxonomical knowledge and environmental information, which are not always accessible. Thus, a step forward is to build general statistical models to classify species into RFG. Under the hypothesis that an organism's response to environmental conditionsdetermines their functional traits, here represented by the RFG, we predict that morphology and classification into broad taxonomic groups willexplain RFG independently from environmental information and expert knowledge. To evaluate the predictive ability of morphological traits (e.g. volume) and taxonomic affiliation (e.g. chroococcal Cyanobacteria) as discriminant variables of RFG, we compiled 1,300 species (264 waterbodies) and applied Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART). We divided the data to train the models and test their performance. RF successfully classified species into the 28 RFG (only c. 10% test error) with an average individual RFG success rate of 84.6 (range=33%-100%). This is a relatively high percentage of success from an ecological point of view. It suggests that the selected variables are able to reconstruct the RFG and represent well environmental preferences, without including information about local environmental conditions as classifiers. Our results reinforce the functional basis of the RFG and support both morphological traits and taxonomic classification as good proxies of phytoplankton responses to environmental conditions. A dichotomous key based on the CART was constructed, and an R code to classify species into the RFG is freely available. This work may help users to classify species into the RFG, including those that were not previously listed in the Reynolds classification system.

AB Evaluation of the relative influences of environmental and spatial processes in structuring aquatic metacommunities is an essential first step for understanding how these factors govern species distributions and affect spatial and temporal variability in community structure. Such variability has many causes and consequences at different scales. In the case of phytoplankton metacommunities, both species sorting and mass effect processes are likely to be important in structuring the patterns of biomass distribution on large spatial scales. We investigated the influences of environmental and spatial components on the phytoplankton community on a large spatial scale, consisting of a reservoirs-river-floodplain lakes gradient in a Neotropical region. Using partial redundancy analysis, we partitioned the relative role of environmental (environmental filters) and spatial (asymmetric eigenvector maps) processes structuring phytoplankton biomass. A clear difference of the limnological conditions was observed between the reservoirs and river-floodplain lakes system. High species richness and higher mean values of phytoplankton biomass were recorded in the floodplain lakes. Variation partitioning demonstrated the importance of both environmental and spatial process in phytoplankton biomass structuring. However, the relative importance of these processes may vary over time. Our results suggest that from a metacommunity perspective, the phytoplankton biomass of upstream reservoirs and a downstream river-floodplain lakes system is determined by environmental conditions (species sorting process), mainly in the floodplain lakes; and by high dispersion rates favoured by the connectivity and unidirectional flow (mass effect process), mainly between the reservoirs and the river.

AB 1. Insect herbivores choose their food according to as protein to carbohydrate ratio, but the reasons why different species have contrasting intake targets remain unclear. According to the growth rate hypothesis, P-rich insects have higher growth rates, It is therefore expected that P-rich insects will prefer plants that are high in protein (hence in nitrogen, N) and phosphorus (P).
   2. To test this hypothesis, the ecological stoichiometry and the interaction network frameworks were combined. The food preferences of 24 plant species by 23 grasshopper species were determined, and the N and P contents of both trophic levels were measured. The weighted mean P and N contents of the consumed plants, which represent the grasshoppers' feeding niche, were highly correlated, indicating that the grasshoppers' diets are spread along a single functional niche axis. The links between the stoichiometry of the plants and their consumers were then tested with the fourth corner analysis, a. multivariate technique combining the plant traits, the insect traits and the interaction network.
   3. In line with the earlier hypothesis, P-rich grasshoppers consumed plants high in N and P, probably because their growth rate is higher. These findings therefore introduce a mechanism that accounts for interspecific differences in diet preference. They also contribute to an understanding of how herbivore communities might respond to P and N limitation in ecosystems, and how complex interaction networks can influence biogeochemical cycles of N and P.

AB Biological indicators are frequently used to assess the effects of anthropogenic stressors on freshwater ecosystems. The structure of fish communities and their response to stressors have been commonly described by taxonomic richness, diversity and evenness. More recently, functional structure of communities has also been suggested to be a reliable indicator of disturbance. This article aimed at testing whether taxonomic and functional diversity metrics can provide comparable or complementary information on the response of fish communities to eutrophication and abundance of non-native species in reservoirs. Comparison of the responses of taxonomic and functional diversities to biogeography, habitat and stressors was made in 112 French reservoirs. Widely observed effects of biogeographic and habitat variables on taxonomic and functional diversities were identified. Taxonomic and functional richness metrics notably increased with lake area and temperature respectively. Taxonomic diversity metrics did not respond to any stressor, while all functional diversity metrics were found to be impacted by non-native species. Eutrophication was further found to decrease the impact of non-native species on two functional diversity metrics: evenness and divergence. Our study therefore reveals that functional metrics are more sensitive than taxonomic metrics to anthropogenic stressors in the studied reservoirs. Still, the multiple linear regressions tested had overall low explanatory power. Further refinements will thus be needed to use this type of metrics in an impact assessment scheme.

AB Understanding restoration effectiveness is often impaired by a lack of high-quality, long-term monitoring data and, to date, few researchers have used species' trait information to gain insight into the processes that drive the reaction of fish communities to restoration. We examined fish-community responses with a highly resolved data set from 21 consecutive years of electrofishing (4 years prerestoration and 17 years postrestoration) at multiple restored and unrestored reaches from a river restoration project on the Lippe River, Germany. Fish abundance peaked in the third year after the restoration; abundance was 6 times higher than before the restoration. After 5-7 years, species richness and abundance stabilized at 2 and 3.5 times higher levels relative to the prerestoration level, respectively. However, interannual variability of species richness and abundance remained considerable, illustrating the challenge of reliably assessing restoration outcomes based on data from individual samplings, especially in the first years following restoration. Life-history and reproduction-related traits best explained differences in species' responses to restoration. Opportunistic short-lived species with early female maturity and multiple spawning runs per year exhibited the strongest increase in abundance, which reflected their ability to rapidly colonize new habitats. These often small-bodied and fusiform fishes typically live in dynamic and ephemeral instream and floodplain areas that river-habitat restorations often aim to create, and in this case their increases in abundance indicated successful restoration. Our results suggest that a greater consideration of species' traits may enhance the causal understanding of community processes and the coupling of restoration to functional ecology. Trait-based assessments of restoration outcomes would furthermore allow for easier transfer of knowledge across biogeographic borders than studies based on taxonomy.

AB Identifying patterns in the effects of temperature on species' population abundances could help develop a general framework for predicting the consequences of climate change across different communities and realms. We used long-term population time series data from terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species communities within central Europe to compare the effects of temperature on abundance across a broad range of taxonomic groups. We asked whether there was an average relationship between temperatures in different seasons and annual abundances of species in a community, and whether species attributes (temperature range of distribution, range size, habitat breadth, dispersal ability, body size, and lifespan) explained interspecific variation in the relationship between temperature and abundance. We found that, on average, warmer winter temperatures were associated with greater abundances in terrestrial communities (ground beetles, spiders, and birds) but not always in aquatic communities (freshwater and marine invertebrates and fish). The abundances of species with large geographical ranges, larger body sizes, and longer lifespans tended to be less related to temperature. Our results suggest that climate change may have, in general, positive effects on species' abundances within many terrestrial communities in central Europe while the effects are less predictable in aquatic communities.

AB In order to better understand and predict the dynamics of benthic macroinvertebrate communities, we need to first define the functional components of benthic biodiversity and then provide a mechanistic description of how they interact with their abiotic environment, their basic resources and each other. These interactions should be largely controlled by readily available biological traits, making trait-based modelling an ideal framework for the synthesis of relevant hypotheses from ecological theory and expert knowledge. With the help of benthic species traits, we derived a set of first principles regarding the role of organisms in processes of environmental filtering, consumption of algae/detritus, predation, use of space, biogenic habitat modification and trade-offs in the utilization and allocation of resources. These principles were incorporated into qualitative models in the form of functional relationships linking groups of,benthic organisms in the Rance estuary (Brittany, France). The general stability of these models illustrates their potential to persist in time and to constitute a plausible representation of the natural world. Their structure provides insight into the role of various community assembly mechanisms and the direction that the system might take in response to perturbations. The results are expected to inform the development of quantitative models reproducing the spatial and temporal dynamics of marine benthic biodiversity in the Rance estuary. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bladderworts (Utricularia, Lentibulariaceae, Lamiales) constitute the largest genus of carnivorous plants but only aquatic species (about one fifth of the genus) have so far been thoroughly studied as to their suction trap functioning. In this study, we comparatively investigated trap biomechanics in 19 Utricularia species to examine correlations between life-forms, trapping mechanisms, and functional-morphological traits. Our investigations show the existence of two functional trap principles (passive trap in U. multifida vs. active suction traps), and - in active suction traps - three main trapdoor movement types (with several subtypes). The trapdoor movement types and their corresponding functional-morphological features most presumably represent adaptations to the respective habitat. We furthermore give insights into fluid dynamics during suction in three representatives of the main types of trapdoor movement. The results on functional morphology and trapdoor movement were mapped onto a new phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus, derived from the rapidly evolving chloroplast regions trnK, rps16 and trnQ-rps16 and a sampling of 105 Utricularia species in total. We discuss potential scenarios of trap character evolution and species radiation, highlighting possible key innovations that enable such a unique carnivorous lifestyle in different habitats.

AB Despite being described in 1993, the skeleton of Rana pyrenaica Serra-Cobo, 1993 has never been investigated. The present publication thus represents the first description of the osteology of the spring-dwelling Pyrenean small brown frog. Its specific status is osteologically supported by some discrete differences. When compared with other Iberian brown frogs, it shows a mosaic of characters that are difficult to interpret. However, according to ecomorphology, R. pyrenaica shares a robust skeleton morphology and various morphological traits with the more terrestrial Rana temporaria (Linnaeus, 1758), but also shares some more aquatic life osteological characters with the aquatic Rana iberica Boulenger, 1879. As well as increasing what is known about R. pyrenaica, this study also aims to facilitate the correct diagnosis of the species in fossil assemblages and its osteological identification as the prey of other vertebrates in trophic studies.

AB Hard substrates host globally a rich biodiversity, orders of magnitude higher in species number than that in surrounding soft substrates. Among them, marine caves support unique biodiversity and fragile communities but suffer lack of quantitative data on their structure and function, hindering their conservation status assessment. A first approach to the nondestructive ecological monitoring of marine caves by testing surrogates of structural and functional composition of sessile benthos was attempted in two species-rich Mediterranean marine caves. Photographic sampling was performed in different positions on the cave walls, across the horizontal axis, from the entrance inwards. Eighty-four taxa were identified and assigned to 6 biological traits and 32 modalities related to morphology, behavior and ecological affinities, with sponges being the dominant taxon in species richness and coverage. In quest of possible biological surrogates, we examined the spatial variability of the total community structure and function and separately the sponge community structure and function. The observed patterns of the above metrics were significantly correlated with the distance from the entrance, the small-scale variability and their interaction. A positive correlation was found between all examined pairs of those metrics, supporting that: (i) the developed functional approach could be used for the study of marine cave sessile communities, and (ii) sponges could be used as a surrogate taxon for the structural and functional study of these communities. The suggested method could be tested in other types of hard substrate habitats and in multiple locations of the Mediterranean waters, facilitating monitoring schemes and conservation actions.

AB Desferrioxamines are hydroxamate siderophores widely conserved in both aquatic and soil-dwelling Actinobacteria. While the genetic and enzymatic bases of siderophore biosynthesis and their transport in model families of this phylum are well understood, evolutionary studies are lacking. Here, we perform a comprehensive desferrioxamine-centric (des genes) phylogenomic analysis, which includes the genomes of six novel strains isolated from an iron and phosphorous depleted oasis in the Chihuahuan desert of Mexico. Our analyses reveal previously unnoticed desferrioxamine evolutionary patterns, involving both biosynthetic and transport genes, likely to be related to desferrioxamines chemical diversity. The identified patterns were used to postulate experimentally testable hypotheses after phenotypic characterization, including profiling of siderophores production and growth stimulation of co-cultures under iron deficiency. Based in our results, we propose a novel des gene, which we term desG, as responsible for incorporation of phenylacetyl moieties during biosynthesis of previously reported arylated desferrioxamines. Moreover, a genomic-based classification of the siderophore-binding proteins responsible for specific and generalist siderophore assimilation is postulated. This report provides a much-needed evolutionary framework, with specific insights supported by experimental data, to direct the future ecological and functional analysis of desferrioxamines in the environment.

AB Trait-based community assembly analysis, which links the plant traits to the variation of community composition along environmental gradients, has potential to improve the understanding of the impacts of eutrophication on macrophytes and responding process. In this article, we pioneered the use of RLQ and Fourth-Corner methods that establish in a quantitative way the link between macrophyte traits, macrophyte community and water quality in a eutrophic shallow lake, eastern China. A total of 9 environmental variables and 11 macrophyte traits were included in the analysis. We found that total phosphorus in water (25.7%, the contribution to total inertia in RLQ analysis), suspended solids (20.7%), water transparency (17.1%) and Chlorophyll a (14.0%) were the main environmental variables that were associated the macrophyte traits matrix. Among macrophyte traits, life form (15.7%), responded to the environmental conditions the most, followed by leaf nitrogen (13.8%) and specific leaf area (13.6%). The correlation between macrophyte traits and environmental gradients showed that macrophytes with higher leaf nitrogen and higher specific leaf area grew at locations with clear water condition, better water transparency and with less total phosphorus, Chlorophyll a and suspended solids in this shallow eutrophic lake. The results suggested that the leaf nitrogen and specific leaf area of macrophytes had a trend to decrease with the increasing environmental stresses caused by eutrophication. Moreover, we highlighted that total phosphorus in water should be prior considered for the future macrophyte conservation and restoration in this lake.

AB Prussian Carp (Carassius gibelio Bloch, 1782) is one of the most successful invasive species in Eurasia. Recently, Prussian Carp were genetically confirmed in Alberta, Canada, documenting the first detection of this species in North America. Given the close morphological similarity to their sister species, the Goldfish (Carassius auratus Linnaeus, 1758), it is likely that this species has been undetected for some time. We document the spread of Prussian Carp since arrival (circa 2000), and contribute a trait-based risk assessment to potential recipient communities in western North America. Using a meta-analysis of geo-referenced fisheries data in conjunction with original sampling in 2014, we show that the Prussian Carp range has increased by eight-to eleven-fold over 15 years in Alberta at a rate of approximately 233-1,250 km(2) per year. Range expansions in the near future are possible through the Saskatchewan River drainage and south into the Missouri River basin, with easily accessible routes to Midwestern North America through irrigation canals. We show high life history trait overlap with other successful invasive species, such as Goldfish and Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758). Additionally, there was high life history trait overlap with several species of native sunfish (Centrarchidae) and suckers (Catostomidae). This study highlights Prussian Carp's potential to widely impact North American freshwater ecosystems and to successfully compete with native taxa. Considered one of the worst invaders in Eurasia, the arrival of Prussian Carp in North America poses serious concern for fisheries managers. There is an urgent need to develop management plans before further range expansion and disruption of freshwater ecosystems by this new invasive species.

AB The relationship between functional and taxonomic diversity is a major issue in ecology. Biodiversity in aquatic environments is strongly influenced by environmental gradients that act as dispersion and niche barriers. Environmental conditions act as filters to select functional traits, but biotic interactions also play a role in assemblage structure. In headwater streams, the relationship between functional and taxonomic diversity remains unclear. In this study we investigated how environmental conditions, taxonomic diversity and biotic interactions influence the spatial distribution of traits and functional diversity in stream fish species. Standardized sampling of fish species was carried out in 50 m sections of 16 streams located in rainforest enclaves in a semiarid region of Brazil (Caatinga biome). The functional diversity indices displayed different responses to the predictor variables used. Functional richness was mainly influenced by environmental conditions, while functional evenness was mostly determined by taxonomic diversity. On the other hand, functional dispersion was explained by a combination of environmental conditions and taxonomic diversity. The spatial distribution of fish species with the same functional traits was random, indicating that biotic interactions are not a strong predictor in these ecosystems. Channel width, pH and substrate were the most important variables in the spatial distribution of the functional traits of the fish species. Our results suggest that the functional structure of fish assemblages in headwater streams depends mainly on environmental conditions and taxonomic diversity.

AB Evolution of the middle ear ossicles was a key innovation for mammals, enhancing the transmission of airborne sound. Radiation into various habitats from a terrestrial environment resulted in diversification of the auditory mechanisms among mammals. However, due to the paucity of phylogenetically controlled investigations, how middle ear traits have diversified with functional specialization remains unclear. In order to identify the respective patterns for various lifestyles and to gain insights into fossil forms, we employed a high-resolution tomography technique and compared the middle ear morphology of eulipotyphlan species (moles, shrews and hedgehogs), a group that has radiated into various environments, such as terrestrial, aquatic and subterranean habitats. Three-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis was conducted within a phylogenetically controlled framework. Quantitative shapes were found to strongly reflect the degree of subterranean lifestyle and weakly involve phylogeny. Our analyses demonstrate that subterranean adaptation should include a relatively shorter anterior process of the malleus, an enlarged incus, an enlarged stapes footplate and a reduction of the orbicular apophysis. These traits arguably allow improving low-frequency sound transmission at low frequencies and inhibiting the low-frequency noise which disturbs the subterranean animals in hearing airborne sounds.

AB Phytoplankton functional classification based on simple morphological traits may simplify our understanding of variation in this community as a function of environmental filters. We tested the effectiveness of the morphology-based functional group (MBFG) approach as a model of phytoplankton temporal dynamics in a Brazilian subtropical river. The Sao Joao River has an area of approximately 79.10 km(2), with 28.09 km(2) located within the Iguac,u National Park, in Foz do Iguacu, Parana, Brazil. We collected phytoplankton samples and measured environmental variables in the intermediate river section on a monthly basis between August 2008 and July 2009. We tested for differences between the environmental variables, phytoplankton biovolume and sampled months and identified the environmental variables with the greatest influence on MBFGs. Our results revealed clear temporal variability of environmental conditions in this river. We recorded the presence of seven MBFGs (I, II, III, IV, V, VI and VII) in the lotic environment, with MBFG IV (chlorococcal chlorophyceans and desmids), V (flagellates) and VI (diatoms) being the most frequent and most important groups for phytoplankton biomass. Significant temporal differences were found for MBFGs I, II, IV, V and VI, with a clear seasonal succession, especially among MBFGs V and VI. Temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, transparency and nutrients were the main predictors of MBFGs in the Sao Joao River. Approaches based on traits have been increasingly applied in community ecology, and we believe that the MBFG approach can increase our understanding of environmental dynamics as well as improve the assessment of general ecological issues.

AB Microbes and benthic macro-invertebrates interact in sediments to play a major role in the biogeochemical cycling of organic matter, but the extent to which their contributions are modified following natural and anthropogenic changes has received little attention. Here, we investigate how nitrogen transformations, ascertained from changes in archaeal and bacterial N-cycling microbes and water macronutrient concentrations ([NH4-N], [NO2-N], [NO3-N]), in sand and sandy mud sediments differ when macrofaunal communities that have previously experienced contrasting levels of chronic fishing disturbance are exposed to organic matter enrichment. We find that differences in macrofaunal community structure related to differences in fishing activity affect the capacity of the macrofauna to mediate microbial nitrogen cycling in sand, but not in sandy mud environments. Whilst we found no evidence for a change in ammonia oxidiser community structure, we did find an increase in archaeal and bacterial denitrifier (AnirKa, nirS) and anammox (hzo) transcripts in macrofaunal communities characterized by higher ratios of suspension to deposit feeders, and a lower density but higher biomass of sediment-reworking fauna. Our findings suggest that nitrogen transformation in shelf sandy sediments is dependent on the stimulation of specific nitrogen cycling pathways that are associated with differences in the composition and context-dependent expression of the functional traits that belong to the resident bioturbating macrofauna community.

AB 1. A metacommunity is defined as a set of local communities that are connected by dispersal and are controlled by environmental drivers operating at different spatial and temporal scales. Although diatom ecology has been studied extensively in temperate and lotic ecosystems, knowledge of tropical lentic systems is more limited.
   2. We evaluated how planktonic and surface-sediment diatom communities, including trait-based communities, were structured by environmental, spatial and land-use variables in tropical reservoirs. Diatoms were sampled in seven reservoirs (31 sites in total) in south-east Brazil, from the surface sediment and the plankton in summer and winter.
   3. Diatom communities responded primarily to a trophic gradient and secondarily to a light-availability gradient. Connectivity was also a strong predictor, whereas land use had a weaker influence on community variation. Our results further suggested that surface-sediment and planktonic diatom groups were structured by similar environmental variables. Trait-based analysis also indicated that these communities were related to environmental and spatial factors.
   4. We conclude that (1) trophic state, light availability and connectivity were the main drivers of diatoms in this set of tropical reservoirs, resulting in spatially structured communities; (2) patterns for surface-sediment diatoms resembled both summer and winter diatom communities in the plankton; and (3) the effects of the explanatory variables (local environment, connectivity and land use) varied among the different biological datasets (i.e. when organised taxonomically, or according to growth morphology, cell size or trophic preference). We emphasize that studies in tropical reservoirs should take spatial variables into account, due to the connectivity of the sites.

AB In this paper, we describe an empirical approach to model community structure using phylogenetic signals. That approach combines information about the species (i.e. traits and phylogeny) with information about the habitat (i.e. environmental conditions and spatial distribution of sampling sites) and their interactions to predict the species responses (e.g. the local densities). As an application, we use the approach to model fish densities in rivers. In the model, the different species and size classes were described using a functional trait, body length, and phylogenetic eigenvectors maps whereas the sites were described using water velocity, depth, substrate composition, macrophyte cover, degree-days, total phosphorus, and spatial eigenvector maps. The model (estimated using a regularised Poisson-family generalised linear modelling approach) fitted the data well (likelihood-based R-adj(2) = 0.512) and showed fair predictive power (likelihood-based cross-validation R-2 = 0.283) to predict the density of fish pertaining to 48 species totalling 143 combinations of species and size classes in 15 unregulated Canadian rivers. Using the model as a baseline to estimate the effect of flow regulation on community composition, we found that, with few exceptions, the densities of most fish species were lower in regulated than in unregulated rivers. Phylogenetics have been proposed to study community structure, but this is, to our knowledge, the first time phylogenetic information is used explicitly for numerical habitat modelling. We expect that models of that type will be in increasing demand now that development projects are routinely assessed through impact studies.

AB The success of an invasive plant species could be explained by trade-off between growth and defence. The aim of this paper was to explore the responses of two non-native aquatic macrophytes Elodea canadensis and Elodea nuttallii to herbivores in their introduced range. We assessed the palatability of the two phylogenetically close aquatic plant species in field and their responses to gammarid consumption in spring, summer and autumn in a microcosm experiment. We measured the variation of functional traits for each season. The traits selected were those judged most closely related to the allocation of resources to growth or to resistance against herbivores. We clearly established that the strategies of the two species were different and that their consumption rate differed in summer. In summer, E. canadensis allocated more of its resources to structural defence (leaf toughness). The increase in leaf thickness reduced the palatability of E. canadensis, whereas E. nuttallii stimulated its growth. Moreover, a decrease in dry matter content in E. nuttallii was found during the growing season in field. In autumn, both plant species accumulated nitrogen and phosphorus in their tissues. We also demonstrated that neither species induced efficient chemical defences against the herbivores. The different strategies of these two Elodea species could be explained by their different resident times in the introduced area and by an adaptation of the naturalised E. canadensis to herbivores.

AB Mayfly emergence was studied in the Plitvice Lakes National Park (Croatia) monthly over a 2-year period in four habitats (springs, streams, mountainous rivers, tufa barriers) using monthly collections of emergence traps. A total of 12 mayfly taxa were recorded. Almost half of the collected specimens belonged to the genus Baetis Leach, 1815, which was recorded at every site, but we were unable to distinguish between two included species (B. rhodani and B. cf. nubecularis). Other abundant species were Centroptilum luteolum (Muller, 1776), Alainites muticus (Linnaeus, 1758), Habrophlebia lauta Eaton 1884, Paraleptophlebia submarginata (Stephens, 1835), Serratella ignita (Poda, 1761), Ephemera danica Muller, 1764 and Rhithrogena braaschi Jacob, 1974. The mayfly assemblages at all sites were dominated by species typical of the rhithral zone, but there was a shift in species composition along a longitudinal gradient (from 720 to 390 m a.s.l.) from dominance of eucrenal-epirhithral to metarhithral-hyporhithral elements and finally to appearance of metapotamal and littoral elements. Two environmental factors, maximum water temperature and mean pH, had the highest influence on the mayfly assemblages. Emergence mainly occurred between March and November and was related to the elevated water temperature. Emergence patterns of some species were in accordance with their typical Central European emergence patterns (e.g. S. ignita, H. lauta) while some others showed certain discrepancies (e.g. longer emergence period in Rh. braaschi and P. submarginata, one generation emergence in A. muticus and variable emergence patterns between the sites and between the two studied years in C. luteolum). The current study provides a significant contribution to the knowledge of mayfly ecology in karst freshwater habitats which forms a basis for further investigation and monitoring of mayflies in this area.

AB Organisms that are isolated into extreme environments often evolve extreme phenotypes. However, global patterns of dynamic gene expression changes that accompany dramatic environmental changes remain largely unknown. The blind Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, has evolved a number of severe cave-associated phenotypes including loss of vision and pigmentation, craniofacial bone fusions, increased fat storage, reduced sleep, and amplified nonvisual sensory systems. Interestingly, surface-dwelling forms have repeatedly entered different caves throughout Mexico, providing a natural set of replicate instances of cave isolation. These surrogate ancestral surface-dwelling forms persist in nearby rivers, enabling direct comparisons to the derived cave-dwelling form. We evaluated changes associated with subterranean isolation by measuring differential gene expression in two geographically distinct cave-dwelling populations (Pachon and Tinaja). To understand the impact of these expression changes on development, we performed RNA-sequencing across four critical stages during which troglomorphic traits first appear in cavefish embryos. Gene ontology (GO) studies revealed similar functional profiles evolved in both independent cave lineages. However, enrichment studies indicated that similar GO profiles were occasionally mediated by different genes. Certain master regulators, such as Otx2 and Mitf, appear to be important loci for cave adaptation, as remarkably similar patterns of expression were identified in both independent cave lineages. This work reveals that adaptation to an extreme environment, in two distinct cavefish lineages, evolves through a combination of unique and shared gene expression patterns. Shared expression profiles reflect common environmental pressures, while unique expression likely reflects the fact that similar adaptive traits evolve through diverse genetic mechanisms.

AB Ecoevolutionary dynamics of the gut microbiota at the macroscale level, that is, in across-species comparisons, are largely driven by ecological variables and host genotype. The repeated explosive radiations of African cichlid fishes in distinct lakes, following a dietary diversification in a context of reduced genetic diversity, provide a natural setup to explore convergence, divergence and repeatability in patterns of microbiota dynamics as a function of the host diet, phylogeny and environment. Here we characterized by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing the gut microbiota of 29 cichlid species from two distinct lakes/radiations (Tanganyika and Barombi Mbo) and across a broad dietary and phylogenetic range. Within each lake, a significant deviation between a carnivorous and herbivorous lifestyle was found. Herbivore species were characterized by an increased bacterial taxonomic and functional diversity and converged in key compositional and functional community aspects. Despite a significant lake effect on the microbiota structure, this process has occurred with remarkable parallels in the two lakes. A metabolic signature most likely explains this trend, as indicated by a significant enrichment in herbivores/omnivores of bacterial taxa and functions associated with fiber degradation and detoxification of plant chemical compounds. Overall, compositional and functional aspects of the gut microbiota individually and altogether validate and predict main cichlid dietary habits, suggesting a fundamental role of gut bacteria in cichlid niche expansion and adaptation.

AB Community structures of benthic invertebrates in different alpine stream types have been well documented and modeled against environmental conditions and change. However, community structure cannot be linked directly to community functions or processes, and this problem prevents clear estimation of functional consequences of environmental changes. In this article, we highlight the need to focus research efforts on the trophic ecology of alpine streams for several reasons. 1) The trophic ecology of invertebrates is remarkably understudied in the field of alpine stream ecology (only 7% of published studies), but the trophic ecology of invertebrates underlies crucial functions in these ecosystems. 2) Classifications of species into functional feeding groups, traits often used to express the functionality of invertebrate communities, are missing for several alpine species or have been deduced from classifications based on higher taxonomic levels. 3) Most investigators focused on a few trophic levels, whereas use of new analytical methods, such as Bayesian stable-isotope mixing models could provide statistically sophisticated estimations of multiple food-source contributions to consumers' diets. 4) Out-dated ideas need to be revised; e.g., we demonstrate that Diamesa species can actively select their food, which is against the established assumption that animals in harsh environments are forced to feed on everything they can get. Based on literature studies, we summarized most critical research needs on the trophic ecology of alpine stream invertebrates. Our goal is to promote ways to understand the ecological function of alpine stream invertebrates and the potential effects of alteration of their trophic relationships by ongoing environmental changes like glacier retreat, water exploitation, or immigration of invasive species.

AB Loss of substrate heterogeneity or patchiness is common in lowland streams with disturbed hydrological regimes. At the reach scale, peak discharges tend to homogenize the stream bed and decrease the availability of specific microhabitat types. This spatial shift in habitats toward a more homogeneous landscape could have large negative effects on species that perform essential ecosystem processes. We conducted an aquatic mesocosm experiment to test the effect of habitat homogenization on survival and fitness of 2 species of Trichoptera (Micropterna sequax and Potamophylax rotundipennis). We used caddisflies as model organisms because of their abundance in lowland streams, their representativeness of the total shredder community, and their important role in leaf-litter decomposition. We reared larvae in artificial recirculating channels containing leaf and sand patches in 3 spatial configurations, differing in homogeneity of substrates, varying from few large patches to many small patches. We used emergence rate as a measure of survival and biomass and wing span of the adults as fitness correlates. For M. sequax, survival was lower in the homogeneous than in the heterogeneous configurations, but patch configuration did not affect fitness. For P. rotundipennis, spatial configuration of the patches did not affect survival, but the longest forewings for both males and females were found in the homogeneous configuration. Our results suggest that both species experience intraspecific resource competition arising from the spatial distribution of patches, expressed as an investment in wing development (e.g., dispersal capacity) in P. rotundipennis and resulting in lower survival rates in M. sequax. Our results indicate the importance of knowledge of trait-based responses and highlight the effects of the configuration of stream bottom substrate for its inhabitants on microscale.

AB The widespread degradation of lotic ecosystems has prompted extensive river restoration efforts globally, but many studies have reported modest ecological responses to rehabilitation practices. The functional properties of biotic communities are rarely examined within post-project appraisals, which would provide more ecological information underpinning ecosystem responses to restoration practices and potentially pinpoint project limitations. This study examines macroinvertebrate community responses to three projects which aimed to physically restore channel morphologies. Taxonomic and functional trait compositions supported by widely occurring lotic habitats (biotopes) were examined across paired restored and non-restored (control) reaches. The multivariate location (average community composition) of taxonomic and functional trait compositions differed marginally between control and restored reaches. However, changes in the amount of multivariate dispersion were more robust and indicated greater ecological heterogeneity within restored reaches, particularly when considering functional trait compositions. Organic biotopes (macrophyte stands and macroalgae) occurred widely across all study sites and supported a high alpha (within-habitat) taxonomic diversity compared to mineralogical biotopes (sand and gravel patches), which were characteristic of restored reaches. However, mineralogical biotopes possessed a higher beta (between-habitat) functional diversity, although this was less pronounced for taxonomic compositions. This study demonstrates that examining the functional and structural properties of taxa across distinct biotopes can provide a greater understanding of biotic responses to river restoration works. Such information could be used to better understand the ecological implications of rehabilitation practices and guide more effective management strategies.

AB Despite the increasing number of studies on use of a functional diversity approach in community ecology, minimal information is available on functional traits of zooplankton in tropical and subtropical freshwater systems. The versatility of functional-trait-based approaches helps provide insight into many ecological processes in freshwater communities. We aim to provide baseline information on functional traits for tropical and subtropical Cladocera. Data on functional traits were gathered using published and unpublished data from Asia. The functional traits were chosen based on data availability and importance to the region's ecological conditions. Ten traits were chosen based on these criteria: two feeding, one reproductive, six survival, and one growth. Clustering of species showed possible unique and overlapping ecological roles and the impact of traits on the possible competition between and coexistence of species. Principal component analysis revealed tradeoffs between functional traits, where species that are heavily correlated with reproductive and growth traits do not usually have good survival traits and vice versa. These results can be used for further investigations on use of functional diversity and comparison of cladoceran communities, and provide additional insight into competition and coexistence within and structure of zooplankton communities across a wide range of ecological gradients.

AB What are the projected impacts of climate change on community composition and consequentially on the distribution of functional traits? Answers to these questions are somewhat unclear but critical for designing ecological management strategies. Here we forecast potential impacts of climate change on freshwater lake fish communities of Ontario, Canada, by contrasting species composition, species richness, functional diversity and functional composition for present versus projected communities under "best-case" and "business-as-usual" climate change scenarios. Results indicate that the composition of projected communities differs from present, and includes a shift from cold- and cool-water species to warm-water species. Species richness in projected communities is estimated to increase by 60-81%, but functional diversity is estimated to decline. These projected communities are estimated to have on average 22% shorter mean body length, 38% lighter body weight and 36% less fecundity than present. Also, the present configuration of sport and commercially important fishes are projected to decline in their distribution, potentially impacting ecosystem services associated with commercial and recreational fisheries. Together, climate change may initiate a compositional shift that may result in an important shift in community functional structure, which is likely to affect important aquatic ecosystem services.

AB Microbial filter feeders are an important group of grazers, significant to the microbial loop, aquatic food webs, and biogeochemical cycling. Our understanding of microbial filter feeding is poor, and, importantly, it is unknown what force microbial filter feeders must generate to process adequate amounts of water. Also, the trade-off in the filter spacing remains unexplored, despite its simple formulation: A filter too coarse will allow suitably sized prey to pass unintercepted, whereas a filter too fine will cause strong flow resistance. We quantify the feeding flow of the filter-feeding choanoflagellate Diaphanoeca grandis using particle tracking, and demonstrate that the current understanding of microbial filter feeding is inconsistent with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and analytical estimates. Both approaches underestimate observed filtration rates by more than an order of magnitude; the beating flagellum is simply unable to draw enough water through the fine filter. We find similar discrepancies for other choanoflagellate species, highlighting an apparent paradox. Our observations motivate us to suggest a radically different filtration mechanism that requires a flagellar vane (sheet), something notoriously difficult to visualize but sporadically observed in the related choanocytes (sponges). A CFD model with a flagellar vane correctly predicts the filtration rate of D. grandis, and using a simple model we can account for the filtration rates of other microbial filter feeders. We finally predict how optimum filter mesh size increases with cell size in microbial filter feeders, a prediction that accords very well with observations. We expect our results to be of significance for small-scale biophysics and trait-based ecological modeling.

AB Body size is a synthetic functional trait determining many key ecosystem properties. Reduction in average body size has been suggested as one of the universal responses to global warming in aquatic ecosystems. Climate change, however, coincides with human-enhanced dispersal of alien species and can facilitate their establishment. We address effects of species introductions on the size structure of recipient communities using data on Red Sea bivalves entering the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal. We show that the invasion leads to increase in median body size of the Mediterranean assemblage. Alien species are significantly larger than native Mediterranean bivalves, even though they represent a random subset of the Red Sea species with respect to body size. The observed patterns result primarily from the differences in the taxonomic composition and body-size distributions of the source and recipient species pools. In contrast to the expectations based on the general temperature-size relationships in marine ectotherms, continued warming of the Mediterranean Sea indirectly leads to an increase in the proportion of large-bodied species in bivalve assemblages by accelerating the entry and spread of tropical aliens. These results underscore complex interactions between changing climate and species invasions in driving functional shifts in marine ecosystems.

AB Ecological processes are generally scale-dependent and there is little consensus about the relative importance of deterministic versus stochastic processes in driving patterns of biological diversity. We investigated how the relationship between functional dispersion and environmental gradients changes with spatial scale in subtropical freshwater lakes. The functional alpha and beta dispersions of all the tested traits were significantly under-dispersed across spatial scales and along environmental gradients. Results showed more functional similarity within communities in leaf dry mass content and flowering duration but less functional turnover among communities in all the tested traits at regional scales (Yunnan-Guizhou plateau and the middle and low reaches of the Yangtze River). The strengths and directions of environmental effects on the functional alpha and beta dispersions depended on the selected traits, diversity metrics and spatial scales. Surprisingly, broad-scale factors-elevation and water transparency-decreased the functional turnover for most traits along the gradients, whereas fine-scale factors-water depth-produced the opposite patterns along the gradient, depending on the trait selected. Our study highlights the dominant role of deterministic assembly processes in structuring the local functional composition and governing the spatial functional turnover of macrophyte communities across multiple spatial scales.

AB Clogging, the streambed colmation by fine sediments, is an important widespread source of impact affecting freshwaters. Alterations in stream morphology and hydrology, added to the effects of global climate change, are responsible for this phenomenon, that is particularly pernicious in mountainous lotic systems naturally characterized by coarse substrates. Among the studies investigating this issue some were descriptive, while others used artificial substrates to compare ongoing fine sediment accumulation and macro invertebrate assemblage recruitment. Other studies used from the outset artificial substrates arranged with different levels of clogging. Our study fits into this line, but adding an innovative element simulating different availability of coarse particulate organic matter, i.e. the main trophic input in low-order, mountainous stream. To investigate how clogging and CPOM can influence macroinvertebrate communities, we placed 135 artificial substrates in the upper Po river ( NW Italy). We set up a three way factorial design with three different levels of sedimentation and terrestrial leaf material. Artificial substrates were removed on three different dates. Benthic invertebrates were identified and classified according to their bio-ecological traits. We also measured macroinvertebrate dry mass and CPOM degradation in the different trap types. Our findings show that clogging acts as a selective filter influencing taxa richness, density, functional composition and biomass of benthic assemblage. Moreover, fine sediments affect the energetic dynamics in the river ecosystem, decreasing the mass loss rate of terrestrial leaves. Interestingly, our results clearly demonstrate that high availability of CPOM can buffer the negative effect of clogging, suggesting that an adequate input of allochthonous organic matter may lessen the impact of fine sediment deposition. Because land use transformation and removal of wooded riparian areas increase clogging and simultaneously reduces the input of CPOM, our findings stress the importance to include the management of river basins in the conservation strategies of mountainous streams.

AB Populus euphratica, a constitutive tree species of the Central-Asian riparian forests, forms extremely heterophyllous leaves. Along gradients of salinity and water supply from the soil in arid regions of NW China, we tested whether specific leaf area (SLA), a pivotal plant functional trait, is related to other morphological variables and to the productivity of the trees as well as to important physiological variables (foliar concentrations or ratios of sodium (Na+), nutrients and stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen( delta O-18)). We evaluated our data at the leaf, tree and stand level.
   Under the arid climate of the study area, we found large morphological variation among the leaves, which, however, converged to a range of SLA (4.7-12.5 m(2)kg(-1) across 95% of the total sample size) that is small when compared to temperate deciduous forest trees of more humid regions. Correlations between SLA and morphological variables (leaf area, number of teeth at the leaf margin, ratio of blade width to blade length) were weak. However, SLA exhibited a significantly negative correlation with foliar delta C-13, and a positive one, with tree height, annual above-ground wood production (AAWP) and (marginally) with stand density. SLA increased with increasing water supply from the soil within a given site but not across sites. Foliar Na+ was negatively related to potassium concentration and, at two out of three study sites, positively to delta O-18, but not to SLA, tree morphology, AAWP and stand density. AAWP was not related to nutrient concentrations. We conclude that in P. euphratica, a permanent phreatophyte in the study region, SLA constitutes an acclimatization not only to the water supply from the soil but also - and probably even more importantly - to the local transpirational demand; and that SLA is related to biomass production through optimization of the water use efficiency.

AB Invasive alien plant species negatively impact native plant communities by out-competing species or changing abiotic and biotic conditions in their introduced range. River systems are especially vulnerable to biological invasions, because waterways can function as invasion corridors. Understanding interactions of invasive and native species and their combined effects on river dynamics is essential for developing cost-effective management strategies. However, numerical models for simulating long-term effects of these processes are lacking. This paper investigates how an invasive alien plant species affects native riparian vegetation and hydro-morphodynamics. A morphodynamic model has been coupled to a dynamic vegetation model that predicts establishment, growth and mortality of riparian trees. We introduced an invasive alien species with life-history traits based on Japanese Knotweed (Fallopia japonica), and investigated effects of low- and high propagule pressure on invasion speed, native vegetation and hydro-morphodynamic processes. Results show that high propagule pressure leads to a decline in native species cover due to competition and the creation of unfavorable native colonization sites. With low propagule pressure the invader facilitates native seedling survival by creating favorable hydro-morphodynamic conditions at colonization sites. With high invader abundance, water levels are raised and sediment transport is reduced during the growing season. In winter, when the above-ground invader biomass is gone, results are reversed and the floodplain is more prone to erosion. Invasion effects thus depend on seasonal above- and below ground dynamic vegetation properties and persistence of the invader, on the characteristics of native species it replaces, and the combined interactions with hydro-morphodynamics.

AB This study aims to compare variation and co-variation of leaf, stem and root economic traits between hydrophytes and sympatric terrestrial plants, and further to explore the ecological strategies of the aquatic plants. We collected data for 145 species from 38 sites in Shaanxi Province, including 60 aquatic species and 85 terrestrial species (112 genera and 48 families). Fifteen plant economic traits of these species were measured, including specific leaf area, dry matter content and C, N, P stoichiometry in leaves, stems and roots. Multivariate analysis was employed to uncover the differences in economic trade-offs between aquatic and terrestrial plants. The results indicated that: (1) Hydrophytes exhibited much higher specific leaf area and lower mean leaf dry matter content, stem dry matter content, root dry matter content, stem carbon content and root carbon content compared with that of terrestrial plants in order to adapt to the aquatic environment, that is, there were differences in mean traits about the economic trade-offs faced by hydrophytes and terrestrial plants. (2) The leaf economic spectrum of aquatic plants in this region coincided with the worldwide leaf economics spectrum, while hydrophytes are located at the extreme of thin leaves which is conducive to rapid acquisition of resources. (3) Aquatic and terrestrial species can be discriminated by few functional traits related to resource acquisition and support tissues. (4) Aquatic and terrestrial plants differed in bivariate correlations between certain economic traits (standardized major axis analysis), indicating differences in plant strategies.

AB Geographic patterns of biodiversity result from broad-scale biogeographic and present-day ecological processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative importance of biogeographic history and ecology driving patterns of diversity in modern primate communities in Madagascar. I collected data on endemic lemur species co-occurrence from range maps and survey literature for 100 communities in protected areas. I quantified and compared taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions of intra- and intersite diversity. I tested environmental and geographic predictors of diversity and endemism. I calculated deforestation rates within protected areas between the years 2000 and 2014, and tested if diversity is related to forest cover and loss. I found the phylogenetic structure of lemur communities could be explained primarily by remotely sensed plant productivity, supporting the hypothesis that there was ecological differentiation among ecoregions, while functional-trait disparity was not strongly related to environment. Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity also increased with increasing topographic heterogeneity. Beta diversity was explained by both differences in ecology among localities and potential river barriers. Approximately 3000 km(2) were deforested in protected areas since the year 2000, threatening the most diverse communities (up to 31%/park). The strong positive association of plant productivity and topographic heterogeneity with lemur diversity indicates that high productivity, rugged landscapes support greater diversity. Both ecology and river barriers influenced lemur community ecology and biogeography. These results underscore the need for focused conservation efforts to slow the loss of irreplaceable evolutionary and ecological diversity.

AB Comparisons of community-level functional traits across environmental gradients have potential for identifying links among plant characteristics, adaptations to stress and disturbance, and community assembly. We investigated community-level variation in specific leaf area (SLA), plant mature height, seed mass, stem specific gravity (SSG), relative cover of C4 species, and total plant cover over hydrologic zones and gradients in years 2013 and 2014 in the riparian plant community along the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon. Vegetation cover was lowest in the frequently inundated active channel zone, indicating constraints on plant establishment and production by flood disturbance and anaerobic stress. Changes in trait values over hydrologic zones and inundation gradients indicate that frequently inundated plots exhibit a community-level ruderal strategy with adaptation to submergence (high SLA and low SSG, height, seed mass, C4 relative cover), whereas less frequently inundated plots exhibit adaptation to drought and infrequent flood disturbance (low SLA and high SSG, height, seed mass, C4 relative cover). Variation in traits not associated with inundation suggests niche differentiation and multiple modes of community assembly. The results enhance understanding of future responses of riparian communities of the Grand Canyon to anticipated drying and changes in hydrologic regime.

AB Deciphering the mechanisms by which climate change interacts with invasive species to affect biodiversity is a major challenge of global change biology. We conducted experiments to determine whether the global invader, Gambusia holbrooki, was more resistant to high water temperature (heat) and low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) than a threatened native fish, Nannoperca australis. Metabolic experiments conducted at 25 and 29 degrees C showed that G. holbrooki had at least four times the capacity for metabolic depression during hypoxia than N. australis. An increase in environmental temperature from 25 to 29 degrees C had no significant impact on the critical oxygen tension, P-crit, of G. holbrooki, but significantly and strongly increased P-crit of N. australis. Gambusia holbrooki also had a lower Q(10) of standard metabolic rate than N. australis. Our results indicate that G. holbrooki have physiological traits conferring greater resistance to hypoxia than N. australis, and as temperature increases, the resistance of N. australis to hypoxia was more eroded than that of G. holbrooki. Intensive monitoring of the temperature and dissolved oxygen dynamics of wetlands showed that contemporary heat waves are already causing conditions that might give G. holbrooki the edge over N. australis on Australian floodplains. Our study adds weight to recent anecdotal reports of drought and heat waves causing localised extinction of N. australis, but the proliferation of G. holbrooki.

AB The functional trait framework, an ecological tool powerful for its simplicity and ability to facilitate modeling and generalization across environmental gradients, can capture the interactions between ecological and physical processes that shape riparian ecosystems. We demonstrate that ecological-response traits that describe how a plant will respond to abiotic stressors are similar, or strongly correlated, to morphological-effect traits important for determining how a plant alters the flow of water and transport of sediment. This link allows for modeling the distribution of ecological and morphological traits on the basis of environmental conditions. Observations of the topographic response of vegetated plots to moderate flood events illustrate how plant traits can be linked to landform geometry. As such, the functional trait framework provides a modeling approach to understand the coupled dynamics of ecogeomorphic systems and inform their conservation.

AB Comprehensive knowledge of the effects of disturbances on biodiversity is crucial for conservation and management, not least because ecosystems with low biodiversity may be the most vulnerable. In rivers, the role of disturbance in shaping aquatic biodiversity has mainly focused on floods. Perennial rivers (PRs) often flood, whereas intermittent rivers (IRs) flood, stop flowing and dry. Despite the recent and significant increase in research on IRs, controversy remains about whether they are more or less biodiverse than PRs. Our aim was to determine (Q1) if PRs and IRs differ in biodiversity and (Q2) if the direction and magnitude of the differences (effect sizes) are related to environmental (climate, season, habitat, longitudinal zonation and anthropogenic disturbance) and/or biological factors (taxonomic group). We conducted a meta-analysis on 44 published studies of PR and IR biodiversity that had replicated data. We applied random effects models to the data to obtain weighted mean effect sizes for differences between PRs and IRs, and their confidence intervals, by first considering all studies and then by splitting studies into groups on the basis of the above factors. We found that biodiversity was significantly higher in PRs than in IRs (Q1). We also detected significant differences (PRs > IRs) in studies of macroinvertebrates, in those conducted within arid and temperate climates, dry and wet sampling seasons, headwaters, and regions subject to different levels of anthropogenic disturbance (Q2). Our meta-analysis suggests that the expected increase in the prevalence of IRs in certain regions of the world due to global change could result in a decrease in freshwater biodiversity. To better manage and preserve aquatic biodiversity under future global change scenarios and to avoid potential ecosystem consequences of biodiversity loss, conservation efforts should be targeted towards those environmental conditions or taxonomic groups with significant differences (PRs > IRs).

AB In seasonal plant communities, it is recognized that topography-related variation in water availability and solar radiation determine vegetation structure and community composition; however, the effects on functional structure, particularly through changes in resource use strategies of plants are still poorly understood. This study examines the effects of slope aspect and topographic position on functional trait dominance in a tropical dry forest landscape and explores whether strategies for coping with drought (avoidance vs. tolerance) segregate spatially along the water stress gradient created by the interaction of these two topographic factors. The study was conducted in the Balsas river basin in south-central Mexico. Functional traits were evaluated in 63 species of trees (>= 2.5 cm diameter at breast height) dominant in plots located at three topographic positions (low, medium and high) and on two slope aspects (north and south). Eight leaf and four stem functional traits, relating to the plants' ability to avoid or tolerate water and temperature stress, were measured. Community-level functional traits were strongly affected by topographic position while only a weak signal was detected by the slope aspect. Contrary to our expectations, attributes associated with drought tolerance predominated on the lower topographic positions of the slopes, (moister and warmer sites), while on the upper parts with drier soil, but cooler air, attributes associated with water stress avoidance dominated. In addition, variation in the dominance of leaf pulvini and trichomes along the topographic gradient suggests environmental filtering by elevated air temperatures and water stress, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that the upper topographic positions that generate a shorter and more fluctuating water-availability window, favor readily-deciduous plants with high levels of water storage in their tissues, traits allowing for a rapid avoid of water stress, whereas on the lower topographic positions, where the soil remains moist for longer periods of time, tardily-deciduous species thrive with dense, low-water content tissues, attributes that are associated with physiological tolerance to drought.

AB Anthropogenic disturbances particularly affect biodiversity in sensitive freshwater ecosystems by causing species loss. Thus, measuring the response of species tomultiple disturbances is a key issue for conservation and environmental management. As it is not practical to assess the response of every species in a community, we compared the performance of trait and taxonomic-based groupings of species for their abilities to predict species loss in a threatened freshwater fish assemblage. Specifically, we examined responses of a Fijian freshwater fish assemblage to deforestation, placement of anthropogenic barriers (overhanging culverts) and the presence of introduced cichlids. Species grouped by traits showed more consistent responses to disturbances than taxonomic groups. In particular, species belonging to trait groups that were estuary associated favoured medium-to-hard substrate, while feeding specialists were highly likely to be absent in catchments with high deforestation and overhanging culverts. The presence of introduced cichlids (Oreochromis mossambicus and O. niloticus) had a smaller effect than deforestation and barriers, but was negatively associated with species richness of diadromous species with climbing ability and positively associated with presences of some piscivores. The trait groups also revealed that detritivores, species favouring soft substrate, and those with a broad dietary range were less sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances. Our study indicates that using traits to predict species loss from disturbed environments can aid in detecting the responses of rare species to disturbance. In addition, we provided a method to estimate the consistency of species' responses to disturbance. This study may ultimately help managers identify the most effective actions for conserving sensitive species that are seldom recorded in surveys.

AB Stream invertebrate assemblages are structured by environmental factors acting at multiple spatial scales. Identifying the spatial scale that most influences the species-environment relationships is a major goal of community ecology. We evaluated the importance of catchment and site scales and associated environmental variables in shaping Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) assemblages in Neotropical savanna headwater streams. Sampling sites were associated with 20 catchment-scale variables that depicted land cover and land use as well as natural geophysical variables such as altitude and climate. Site-scale habitat was characterised by 55 variables that described habitat hydromorphology, substrate, flow, canopy, in-stream cover and water quality. EPT traits were assessed using 28 categories of 7 biological traits, which represented the best available current knowledge for EPT in Neotropical savanna streams. We analysed the relationships between the catchment- and site-scale habitat variables and the taxonomic and trait composition of insect assemblages using 1,760 samples collected in 160 stream sites. Catchment- and site-scale variables both explained significant variation in EPT taxon and trait composition. Substrate, habitat hydromorphology and land use most influenced variation in taxonomic composition, whereas trait composition was mainly affected by land use. Catchment geographic position explained less assemblage variation. To our knowledge, this study is the first assessment of the impact of catchment- and site-scale variables on the trait and taxon composition of stream insect assemblages in Neotropical savanna streams. It highlights the need for better regional biological knowledge of invertebrates to generate more general trait-based approaches in freshwater ecosystem conservation.

AB Periphytic algae are important components of aquatic ecosystems. However, the factors driving periphyton species richness variation remain largely unexplored. Here, we used data from a subtropical floodplain (Upper Parana A River floodplain, Brazil) to quantify the influence of environmental variables (total suspended matter, temperature, conductivity, nutrient concentrations, hydrology, phytoplankton biomass, phytoplankton species richness, aquatic macrophyte species richness and zooplankton density) on overall periphytic algal species richness and on the richness of different algal groups defined by morphological traits (cell size and adherence strategy). We expected that the coefficients of determination of the models estimated for different trait-based groups would be higher than the model coefficient of determination of the entire algal community. We also expected that the relative importance of explanatory variables in predicting species richness would differ among algal groups. The coefficient of determination for the model used to predict overall periphytic algal species richness was higher than the ones obtained for models used to predict the species richness of the different groups. Thus, our first prediction was not supported. Species richness of aquatic macrophytes was the main predictor of periphyton species richness of the entire community and a significant predictor of the species richness of small mobile, large mobile and small-loosely attached algae. Abiotic variables, phytoplankton species richness, chlorophyll-a concentration, and hydrology were also significant predictors, depending on the group. These results suggest that habitat heterogeneity (as proxied by aquatic macrophytes richness) is important for maintaining periphyton species richness in floodplain environments. However, other factors played a role, suggesting that the analysis of species richness of different trait-based groups unveils relationships that were not detectable when the entire community was analysed together.

AB Riparian plant invasions can result in near-monocultures along stream and river systems, prompting management agencies to target invasive species for removal as an ecological restoration strategy. Riparian plant invaders can alter resource conditions in the benthos and drive bottom-up shifts in aquatic biota. However, the influence of management activities on the structure and function of aquatic communities is not well understood. We investigated how removal of a riparian invader, Lonicera maackii (Amur honeysuckle), influenced aquatic macroinvertebrate community functional and taxonomic diversity in a headwater stream. We hypothesized that removal of L. maackii from invaded riparia would result in (H-1) increased aquatic macroinvertebrate abundance, density, and diversity; (H-2) a taxonomic and functional shift in community composition; and, in particular, (H-3) increased functional diversity. Aquatic macroinvertebrates were sampled monthly from autumn 2010 to winter 2013 in headwater stream riffles with a dense riparian L. maackii invasion and those where L. maackii had been experimentally removed. We found macroinvertebrate density was significantly higher in the L. maackii removal reach (P<0.05) and that macroinvertebrate community structure and functional trait presence was distinct between stream reaches and across seasons (P<0.05). The removal reach exhibited greater functional richness during spring and summer and had more unique functionally relevant taxa (20% and 85%) compared with the L. maackii reach (5% and 75%) during summer and autumn seasons. Our results suggest bottom-up processes link restoration activities in the riparian corridor and aquatic biota through alterations of functional composition in the benthic community.

At each season we measured four functional traits: the Relative Growth Rate 'RGR', Relative Leaf surface area Growth Rate, number of lateral branches and roots. E. canadensis showed the highest growth and vigour in spring and in summer. The Relative Growth Rate was enhanced by an elevation of temperature for E. canadensis and for E. densa. A 3 degrees C temperature increase stimulated root production for all species in summer, whereas the number of lateral branches was favoured in spring for E. canadensis. Climate warming had a greater impact on plant growth in spring than in summer and late winter. The response of species to climate warming was species-specific and so an increase in temperature should favour the spread of E. canadensis.

AB Intersexuality in a gonochoric palaemonid shrimp is reported for the first time in a wild population of Macrobrachium amazonicum (Heller,1862). This phenomenon was confirmed based on an investigation of anatomic and morphometric traits and the ultrastructure of gonopores. The intersex had both reproductive organs despite the absence of vitellogenic oocytes and spermatozoa. This individual had a vestigial male gonopore complex and female gonopores. The intersexuality was related to a genetic mutation and/or hormonal disruption because there was no detection of chemicals in the water or parasites in the samples. Non-functional hermaphroditism is a very rare event (0.06%) in M. amazonicum, indicating that this species is gonochoric, and intersex individuals are not reproductively viable.

AB Crustaceans exhibit great diversity of feeding structures with morphological traits that are useful to infer the general trophic habits of species. In this study, we analyzed the functional morphology of comminuting feeding structures (mandibles, chelipeds, gastric mill) of the freshwater crab Trichodactylus borellianus directly related with the food fragmentation. The heterochely and mechanical advantage (MA) of the chelae were also studied. In both analyses, we considered the relationship between morphology and the natural diet. We expected to find a consistent relation between feeding habits and morphological traits. In general, we found simple structures armed with uniform setal systems and feeding appendages without pronounced teeth or spines. Mandibles have primarily cutting functions, helping with the food anchoring and fragmentation with mandibular palps armed with pappose setae. Chelipeds were covered with spines and simple setae. Adult males exhibited right-handedness with high MA of the major chelae. The ingested, relatively large pieces of food are finally chewed by a gastric mill equipped with sharp cusps characteristic of decapods with low ingestion of crude fiber material. The morphology of the feeding apparatus revealed that it is well adapted to an omnivorous diet, being able to cope with dietary changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biological trait analysis is a powerful tool to summarize the spatial temporal patterns of community functioning and ecosystem process at taxon-free resolutions. To identify the optimal colonization period with high homogeneity in functional patterns of protozoa for bioassessment, 1-month baseline colonization survey was conducted in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea. A fuzzy-coding functional trait system was used to summarize the functional structure of protozoan communities during the colonization process. The functional patterns showed a low homogeneity during the early stage (3-7 days), followed by a stable stage (10-14 days) with high homogeneity, and the last stage (21-28 days) with high heterogeneity. The functional richness showed a low variability, while the functional evenness and divergence generally showed a decreasing trend during the whole colonization process. Furthermore, the functional dispersion and RaoQ indices generally leveled off only during the stable stage. These results suggest that it is necessary to determine the optimal exposure time period with high homogeneity of community functioning for bioassessment using protozoan colonization in marine ecosystems.

AB Gizzard shad is a dominant planktivore/detritivore in the Wabash River, and populations crashed in the early 1990s. Previous work (1974-2008) identified a substantial shift in body-size structure and functional trait composition in the Wabash River fish assemblage between 1989 and 1996. Invasive Asian Carp appeared in the Ohio River basin including the Wabash River in the 1990s. Our goal was to test for temporal changes in assemblage composition and trophic structure relative to the invasion of Asian carp from the early 1990s. We hypothesized that establishment of Asian Carp was a contributor to the assemblage composition shift, and that their presence altered the trophic pathways and food sources of native fishes including Gizzard Shad (hostile takeover hypothesis). Alternatively, Asian Carp may have found success through capitalizing on an empty niche, likely left vacant by the decline in Gizzard Shad, or abundance changes in other trophic groups (opportunistic hypothesis). We utilized archival fish and mussel collections to test for trophic changes in the ecosystem using delta C-13 and delta 15N stable isotope analyses. We examined stomach contents of the dominant planktivore/detritivore consumer, Gizzard Shad, from archival and recent collections to test for changes in the phytoplankton community. Stable isotopes indicated a community reliance on other, more deplete, carbon sources than indicated by the algae, and a slight increase between the delta C-13 time periods. Although all functional feeding groups of fishes indicated some reduction in delta N-15, the differences were only significant for omnivores, mussels, and planktivore/detritivores. Although Asian Carp may have contributed to the collapse of Gizzard Shad populations, other stressors were likely more important drivers of their decline. This is the first, albeit indirect, evidence of opportunistic "invasion" as opposed to the historically presumed hostile takeover model.

AB Many lotic ecosystems are spatially and temporally heterogeneous but none more so than dryland streams flowing through arid and semi-arid landscapes. Understanding seasonal variation in richness and trait composition is critical to our fundamental understanding of these dynamic stream networks. Here, we analyzed aquatic macroinvertebrate communities within perennial and intermittent reaches in replicate dryland watersheds in southwestern USA across 10 seasons and 4 years. We quantified how hydrology, season, and microhabitat type affected taxa richness and trait composition. Taxa richness was higher in perennial than intermittent reaches, in pools than riffles, and in fall and summer than in spring. The interaction between hydrology and season was important; the difference between fall high and spring low richness was greater in intermittent than perennial streams. Hydrology was the main predictor of trait composition; intermittent streams supported a larger fraction of small taxa, taxa with the ability to undergo diapause, and uni- or multivoltine taxa (i.e., taxa with shorter life cycles). Trait composition did not vary across seasons among perennial reaches whereas the fraction of aerial dispersers appeared to be greater in spring than other seasons among intermittent reaches. Our results were largely consistent with predictions of the habitat templet; r-selected traits were more frequently represented in intermittent communities. The temporal characterization of macroinvertebrate community structure in dryland streams provides a powerful glimpse of how stream communities may respond to a drying climate.

AB While mechanisms of different carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation pathways in chemolithoautotrohic prokaryotes are well understood for many isolates under laboratory conditions, the ecological significance of diverse CO2 fixation strategies in the environment is mostly unexplored. Six stratified freshwater lakes were chosen to study the distribution and diversity of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle, and the recently discovered archaeal 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (HP/HB) pathway. Eleven primer sets were used to amplify and sequence genes coding for selected key enzymes in the three pathways. Whereas the CBB pathway with different forms of RubisCO (IA, IC and II) was ubiquitous and related to diverse bacterial taxa, encompassing a wide range of potential physiologies, the rTCA cycle in Epsilonproteobacteria and Chloribi was exclusively detected in anoxic water layers. Nitrifiying Nitrosospira and Thaumarchaeota, using the rTCA and HP/HB cycle respectively, are important residents in the aphotic and (micro-)oxic zone of deep lakes. Both taxa were of minor importance in surface waters and in smaller lakes characterized by an anoxic hypolimnion. Overall, this study provides a first insight on how different CO2 fixation strategies and chemical gradients in lakes are associated to the distribution of chemoautotrophic prokaryotes with different functional traits.

AB Flow alteration is widespread in streams, but current understanding of the effects of differences in flow characteristics on stream biological communities is incomplete. We tested hypotheses about the effect of variation in hydrology on stream communities by using generalized additive models to relate watershed information to the values of different flow metrics at gauged sites. Flow models accounted for 54-80% of the spatial variation in flow metric values among gauged sites. We then used these models to predict flow metrics in 842 ungauged stream sites in the mid-Atlantic United States that were sampled for fish, macroinvertebrates, and environmental covariates. Fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages were characterized in terms of a suite of metrics that quantified aspects of community composition, diversity, and functional traits that were expected to be associated with differences in flow characteristics. We related modeled flow metrics to biological metrics in a series of stressor-response models. Our analyses identified both drying and base flow instability as explaining 30-50% of the observed variability in fish and invertebrate community composition. Variations in community composition were related to variations in the prevalence of dispersal traits in invertebrates and trophic guilds in fish. The results demonstrate that we can use statistical models to predict hydrologic conditions at bioassessment sites, which, in turn, we can use to estimate relationships between flow conditions and biological characteristics. This analysis provides an approach to quantify the effects of spatial variation in flow metrics using readily available biomonitoring data.

AB Quantifying how environmental factors control the growth of phytoplankton communities is essential for building a mechanistic understanding of global biogeochemical cycles and aquatic food web dynamics. The strong effects of temperature on population growth rate have inspired two frameworksthe Eppley curve and the metabolic theory of ecologythat produce different quantitative relationships and employ distinct statistical approaches. Reconciling these relationships is necessary to ensure the accuracy of ecosystem models. In this paper, we develop ways to compare these frameworks, overcoming their methodological differences. Then, analyzing an extensive dataset (> 4200 growth rate measurements), we find that increases in population growth rate with temperature are consistent with metabolic theory, and weaker than previous estimates of the Eppley curve. A 10 degrees C temperature increase will increase growth rates by a factor of 1.53, rather than 1.88 as in previous studies of the Eppley curve. Size and functional group membership are also critical. Population growth rates decrease with size, but much less strongly that metabolic theory predicts. The growth rates of different functional groups scale similarly with temperature, but some groups grow faster than others, independent of temperature. Our results reconcile the analytical methods of the Eppley curve and metabolic theory, demonstrate that metabolic theory's temperature-scaling predictions are more accurate, and provide new insights into the factors controlling phytoplankton growth. To avoid over-estimating the effects of temperature on primary productivity, the parameterization of ecosystem models should be revised.

AB In freshwater ecosystems, Chironomidae are currently considered indicators of poor water quality because the family is often abundant in degraded sites. However, it incorporates taxa with a large ecological and physiological diversity and different sensitivity to impairment. Yet, the usual identification of Chironomidae at coarse taxonomic levels (family or subfamily) masks genus and species sensitivities. In this study, we investigate the potential of taxonomic and functional (traits) composition of Chironomidae to detect anthropogenic disturbance. In this context, we tested some a priori hypotheses regarding the ability of Chironomidae taxonomic and trait compositions to discriminate Mediterranean streams affected by multiple stressors from least-disturbed streams. Both taxonomic and Eltonian trait composition discriminated sites according to their disturbance level. Disturbance resulted in the predicted increase of Chironomidae with higher number of stages with hibernation/diapause and of taxa with resistance forms and unpredicted increase of the proportion of taxa with longer life cycles and few generations per year. Life history strategies (LHS), corresponding to multivoltine Chironomidae that do not invest in hemoglobin and lack strong spring synchronization, were well adapted to all our Mediterranean sites with highly changeable environmental conditions. Medium-size animals favored in disturbed sites where the Mediterranean hydrological regime is altered, but the reduced number of larger-size/carnivore Chironomids suggests a limitation to secondary production. Results indicate that Chironomidae genus and respective traits could be a useful tool in the structural and functional assessment of Mediterranean streams. The ubiquitous nature of Chironomidae should be also especially relevant in the assessment of water bodies naturally poor in other groups such as the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, such as the lowland rivers with sandy substrates, lakes, or reservoirs.

AB Most spatial ecology focuses on how species dispersal affects community dynamics and coexistence. Ecosystems, however, are also commonly connected by flows of resources. We experimentally tested how neighbouring communities indirectly influence each other in absence of dispersal, via resource exchanges. Using two-patch microcosm meta-ecosystems, we manipulated community composition and dynamics, by varying separately species key functional traits (autotroph versus heterotroph species and size of consumer species) and trophic structure of aquatic communities (species growing alone or in presence of competitors or predators). We then analysed the effects of species functional traits and trophic structure on communities connected through spatial subsidies in the absence of actual dispersal. Both functional traits and trophic structure strongly affected dynamics across neighbouring communities. Heterotroph communities connected to autotroph neighbours developed better than with heterotroph neighbours, such that coexistence of competitors was determined by the functional traits of the neighbouring community. Densities in autotroph communities were also strikingly higher when receiving subsidies from heterotroph communities compared to their own subsidies when grown in isolated ecosystems. In contrast, communities connected to predator-dominated ecosystems collapsed, without any direct contact with the predators. Our results demonstrate that because community composition and structure modify the distribution of biomass within a community, they may also affect communities connected through subsidies through quantitative and qualitative changes of detritus flows. This stresses that ecosystem management should account for such interdependencies mediated by spatial subsidies, given that local community alterations cascade across space onto other ecosystems even if species dispersal is completely absent.

AB Assessing trait-environment relationships is crucial for predicting effects of natural and human-induced environmental change on biota. We compiled a global database of fish assemblages in estuaries, functional traits of fishes and ecosystem features of estuaries. And we quantified the relative importance of ecosystem features as drivers of patterns of fish functional traits among estuaries worldwide (i.e. drivers of the proportions of fish traits). In addition to biogeographical context, two main environmental gradients regulate traits patterns: firstly temperature, and secondly estuary size and hydrological connectivity of the estuary with the marine ecosystem. Overall, estuaries in colder regions, with larger areas and with higher hydrological connectivity with the marine ecosystem, have higher proportions of marine fish (versus freshwater), macrocarnivores and planktivores (versus omnivores, herbivores and detritivores) and larger fish, with greater maximum depth of distribution and longer lifespan. The observed trait patterns and trait-environment relationships are likely generated by multiple causal processes linked to physiological constraints due to temperature and salinity, size-dependent biotic interactions, as well as habitat availability and connectivity. Biogeographical context and environmental conditions drive species richness and composition, and present results show that they also drive assemblage traits. The observed trait patterns and trait-environment relationships suggest that assemblage composition is determined by the functional role of species within ecosystems. Conservation strategies should be coordinated globally and ensure protection of an array of estuaries that differ in ecosystem features, even if some of those estuaries do not support high species richness.

In the present study, we characterized psammic rotifer communities in terms of dominance structure, trophic traits, taxonomic and functional diversity at a seasonal scale in freshwater lakes across Estonia and coastal beaches of the Baltic Sea. A total of 42 rotifer species were found from the coastal beaches and 66 species from the lakes. Functional indices did not exhibit smaller seasonal variability and neither did they respond better to changes in the environment compared to taxonomic indices. However, there were differences how environmental variables affected these two broad groups of response variables. The taxonomy-based indices of rotifer communities were primarily driven by seasonal temperature regime, sediment characteristics and anthropogenic stressors, whereas the trait-based indices were a function of ecosystem types (freshwater or brackish water). The functional indices of the psammic rotifer communities strongly distinguished between freshwater and brackish habitats indicating that rotifers have different functional roles in food webs in fresh and brackish water environments.

AB Development of reduced-sodium cheese to meet the demands of consumers concerned about sodium levels in their diet is challenging when a high-moisture, higher pH, fresh cheese, such as Queso Fresco (QF), depends on its NaCl salt content to obtain its signature flavor and quality traits. This study evaluated the effects of different Na-K salt blends on the compositional, sensorial, microbial, functional, and rheological properties of QF stored for up to 12 wk at 4 degrees C. Queso Fresco curd from each vat was divided into 6 portions and salted with different blends of NaCl-KCl (Na-K, %): 0.75-0.75, 1.0-0.5, 1.0-1.0, 1.0-1.3, 1.0-1.5, and 2.0-0 (control). Within this narrow salt range (1.5 to 2.5% total salt), the moisture, protein, fat, and lactose levels; water activity; pH; and the textural and rheological properties were not affected by salt treatment or aging. The total salt, sodium, potassium, and ash contents reflected the different Na-K ratios added to the QF. Total aerobic microbial count, overall proteolysis, the release of casein phosphopeptides, and the level of volatile compounds were affected by aging but not by the salt treatment. Only the 1.0-1.3 and 1.0-1.5 Na-K cheeses had sensory saltiness scores similar to that of the 2.0-0 Na-K control QF. Loss of free serum from the cheese matrix increased steadily over the 12 wk, with higher losses found in QF containing 1.5% total salt compared with the higher Na-K blends. In conclusion, KCl substitution is a viable means for reduction of sodium in QF resulting in only minor differences in the quality traits, and levels of 1.0-1.3 and 1.0-1.5 Na-K are recommended to match the saltiness intensity of the 2.0-0 Na-K control. The findings from this study will aid cheese producers in creating reduced-sodium QF for health-conscious consumers.

AB Recent studies have shown that species, functional and phylogenetic diversity are related to different environmental drivers, suggesting that different aspects of alpha diversity may be complementary and may provide different information about community assembly. Such multi-facet community assembly studies are, however, rare in the freshwater realm. We examined the responses of species richness, functional alpha diversity and phylogenetic alpha diversity of littoral macroinvertebrates to environmental gradients in near-pristine boreal lakes. We also examined community assembly mechanisms using null models of functional or phylogenetic clustering, overdispersion and randomness as indications of different assembly mechanisms. We found that the alpha diversity indices examined responded differently to the underlying environmental gradients. Also, phylogenetic and functional alpha diversity indices showed different levels of overdispersion, clustering and randomness, which also varied slightly between the analyses based on abundance and presence-absence data. These results suggested that different alpha diversity indices may provide different information about overdispersion (e.g. caused by biotic interactions) and clustering (e.g. caused by environmental filtering), and emphasised the fact that most individual lakes were inhabited by species that were merely random draws from the functional or phylogenetic species pools available in the study region. Our findings suggested that some individual lakes are assembled by deterministic mechanisms, including environmental filtering and biotic interactions, whereas most individual lake macroinvertebrate communities constitute random draws from the regional species pool or are affected by the antagonistic effects of different assembly processes. Our results may stem from site-specific context dependency in the assembly mechanisms, which might also be a reason why statistical models in aquatic community studies typically explain only a small part of variation in community composition and local diversity.

AB Explaining the variation in communities of soil organisms across plant communities or ecosystems remains a major challenge for ecologists. Several studies have explored how soil communities are affected along ecosystem successional gradients but most of these are based on relatively short term chronosequences. To address the impact of ecosystem age on micro-arthropod communities, we utilized a 5000 year old post-fire chronosequence, which consists of thirty lake islands differing greatly in time since fire in the boreal forested zone of northern Sweden. The Acari community did not change along this chronosequence, indicating that Acari rapidly(<60 yr) reach equilibrium after forest fire and that they are relatively unresponsive to subsequent long term changes in plant community composition and soil quality. The Collembola community composition, however, showed greater responsiveness to the chronosequence and this was best explained through their functional traits. Notably, the youngest (most recently burned) islands, which had the highest ecosystem productivity and fungal mass turnover, were dominated by soil-dwelling (eu-edaphic) Collembola species that are best positioned to take advantage of resource input to the soil. Although plant community characteristics did not emerge as powerful drivers of the Collembola community, we found that Collembola community composition was related to the quality (N and P) of the soil substrate, which reflects a long term legacy of the plant community. Collembola life history characteristics proved to be important for understanding how abundances of different taxa varied relative to one another across the gradients of plant diversity and substrate quality gradients that occur across long-term chronosequences. The causal connection between vertical stratification of Collembola and substrate quality is at present unclear but is likely to be related to their feeding preferences and microhabitat conditions. Because the soil-dwelling Collembola showed a strong decline in abundance with ecosystem retrogression while surface-dwelling Collembola did not these two life history groups may operate as functionally distinct groups within the soil food web across these long-term chronosequences. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ecological parameters based on multiply functional traits have many advantages for monitoring programs by reducing "signal to noise" ratios of observed species data. To identify potential indicators for bioassessment of marine pollution in function space, the functional patterns of protozoan communities and relationships with environmental changes were studied in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea during a 1-year period. The results showed that: (1) the spatial variability in functional trait distributions of the protozoa was significantly associated with changes in environmental variables, especially chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrients on spatial scale; (2) the functional traits, especially food resources and feeding type, were significantly correlated with COD and nutrients; and (3) the functional diversity indices were generally related to nutrients or COD. Based on the results, we suggest that the functional traits and diversity indices of protozoan communities may be used as more effective indicators for bioassessment of marine pollution.

AB Top predator populations, once intensively hunted, are rebounding in size and geographic distribution. The cessation of sealing along coastal Australia and subsequent recovery of Australian Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus and long-nosed A. forsteri fur seals represents a unique opportunity to investigate trophic linkages at a frontier of predator recolonisation. We characterised the diets of both species across 2 locations of recolonisation, one site an established breeding colony, and the other, a new but permanent haul-out site. Using DNA metabarcoding, high taxonomic resolution data on diets was used to inform ecological trait-based analyses across time and location. Australian and long-nosed fur seals consumed 76 and 73 prey taxa, respectively, a prey diversity greater than previously reported. We found unexpected overlap of prey functional traits in the diets of both seal species at the haul-out site, where we observed strong trophic linkages with coastal ecosystems due to the prevalence of benthic, demersal and reef-associated prey. The diets of both seal species at the breeding colony were consistent with for aging patterns observed in the centre of their geographic range regarding diet partitioning between predator species and seasonal trends typically observed. The unexpected differences between sites in this region and the convergence of both predators' effective ecological roles at the range-edge haul-out site correlate with known differences in seal population densities and demographics at these and other newly recolonised locations. This study provides a baseline for the diets and trophic interactions for recovering fur seal populations and from which to understand the evolving ecology of predator recolonisation.

AB Mediterranean streams exhibit highly variable inter-annual and seasonal discharge patterns, exerting an evolutionary pressure that constrains biological communities. Due to climate change, including a decrease in summer rainfall, and concurrent water resource pressures, stream intermittence is increasing in the Mediterranean Basin. In this context, I explored the potential of benthic invertebrate taxa and their biological traits to be used as indicators of different hydrological conditions. I characterized the flow intermittence gradient along a small Mediterranean stream into three aquatic regimes: perennial (P), intermittent with summer pools (IP), and intermittent with dry channels (ID). Then, I compared the performance of taxonomic and trait-based approaches in characterizing the effects of flow intermittence on benthic invertebrate community patterns in two sampling periods: (1) during the flowing period, when pool-riffle sequences were well-established, and (2) during the dry phase, when either isolated pools or dry channels occurred at the intermittent sites. Both the taxonomic and trait composition of communities differed among sites according to their aquatic regime, especially ID sites, which differed considerably from P and IP sites. Organisms from ID sites were characterized by life-history adaptations to flow intermittence (e.g. short life cycles, resistant forms). No significant difference in traits or taxa was observed between P and IP sites in either sampling period. The trait-based approach was a more sensitive indicator of the aquatic regime, emphasizing the need to conduct further research into the development of trait-based biomonitoring and conservation tools for intermittent streams.

AB Aims
   Understanding how environmental factors and human activity drive plant community assembly remains a major challenge in community ecology. Two opposing processes, namely deterministic environmental filtering and nondeterministic elements such as interspecies competition, can be quantified by analyzing trait distributions in the community-assembly process.
   Methods
   We examined the trait-mediated effects of environmental filtering and stochastic process and the distribution over time of nine traits related to vegetative growth, regenerative phase, dispersal capability, decomposition and interspecific competition in plant communities along a degradation gradient in the Xilin River Basin, Inner Mongolia, China. We analyzed the turnover of environmental trait filtering and the divergence/convergence of different traits along the degradation gradient.
   Important Findings
   Our results showed the following. (i) The patterns of trait distribution and filtering were strongly dependent upon the degradation gradient and trait types. Most traits were filtered intensely in degraded grasslands. (ii) Plants with two different strategies showed contrasting trait-distribution patterns. The traits that were related to biological matter cycling showed divergent patterns in highly degraded grasslands, while convergent patterns along the overall gradient were demonstrated in traits associated with other plant strategies. This suggests that the coexistence of multiple 'biological matter cycling-related niches' might be a basic structuring pattern of plant communities in our study area. (iii) The simultaneous occurrence of strong filtering and divergence revealed that environmental filtering does not necessarily prevent competition, and that different traits show different signatures.

AB The responses of bats to land-use change have been extensively studied in temperate zones and the neotropics, but little is known from the palaeotropics. Effective conservation in heavily-populated palaeotropical hotspots requires a better understanding of which bats can and cannot survive in human-modified landscapes. We used catching and acoustic transects to examine bat assemblages in the Western Ghats of India, and identify the species most sensitive to agricultural change. We quantified functional diversity and trait filtering of assemblages in forest fragments, tea and coffee plantations, and along rivers in tea plantations with and without forested corridors, compared to protected forests.
   Functional diversity in forest fragments and shade-grown coffee was similar to that in protected forests, but was far lower in tea plantations. Trait filtering was also strongest in tea plantations. Forested river corridors in tea plantations mitigated much of the loss of functional diversity and the trait filtering seen on rivers in tea plantations without forested corridors. The bats most vulnerable to intensive agriculture were frugivorous, large, had short broad wings, or made constant frequency echolocation calls. The last three features are characteristic of forest animal-eating species that typically take large prey, often by gleaning.
   Ongoing conservation work to restore forest fragments and retain native trees in coffee plantations should be highly beneficial for bats in this landscape. The maintenance of a mosaic landscape with sufficient patches of forest, shade-grown coffee and riparian corridors will help to maintain landscape wide functional diversity in an area dominated by tea plantations.

AB Resource subsidies and biodiversity are essential for maintaining community structure and ecosystem functioning, but the relative importance of consumer diversity and resource characteristics to decomposition remains unclear. Forested headwater streams are detritus-based systems, dependent on leaf litter inputs from adjacent riparian ecosystems, and decomposition of these resources is an important ecosystem function. Here, we examined the effects of consumer community diversity on leaf decomposition in a reciprocal transplant experiment. We asked (1) whether stream consumer communities are adapted to local resources and (2) how functional trait diversity among communities affects the leaf decomposition process. We did not find evidence that communities were adapted to locally derived resource subsidies. Instead, we found that consumer biomass and functional trait diversity as well as resource characteristics were the primary biotic drivers of decomposition. Consumer biomass was stimulated by specific resource subsidies, leading to direct and indirect effects of resource subsidies on ecosystem functioning. Contrary to current theory, we show that decomposition was higher with decreased detritivore functional diversity, suggesting dominant traits encompassing a specific niche increased decomposition. We also show that top-down, consumer diversity effects can be equal in magnitude to the bottom- up effects of resource characteristics during the decomposition process. Our research illustrates the importance of considering multiple biotic and abiotic drivers interacting via multiple pathways to affect a crucial ecosystem function.

AB Functional morphology corresponds to adaptive responses to changes in the environment. In phytoplankton, traits such as the development of mucilage, oil vesicles, filaments and variation in the surface/volume ratio, allow algae to deal with sedimentation, optimizing light and nutrient uptake. The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between traits and variation in physical and chemical conditions in Tota Lake (Boyaca, Colombia). For this, ten samplings were undertaken in a monthly basis between October 2013 and July 2014. We measured water pH, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, alkalinity and total hardness; we also quantified Total Kjeldahl nitrogen and Total phosphorus. Algae were collected at different depths according to Secchi transparency. Taxonomic composition and abundance were estimated by the chamber sedimentation method. Morphological traits were measured for each taxa according to geometric models, allowing traits classification into morphologically based functional groups (MBFG) and having algae biomass expressed as biovolume. The variables were evaluated through Principal Components Analysis, which included time-space effect and it was interpreted according to variation in water level. Through Canonical Correspondence Analysis we established the relationship between phytoplankton biovolume accumulated in form categories and environmental variables. The ordination showed that limnological conditions are influenced by seasonal changes, which are mainly represented by oxygen saturation percentage, Secchi transparency, TKN, hardness and alkalinity. Four MBFG were found: IV, V, VI and VII, being MBFG IV and VII the most representatives. ACC was significant (Monte-Carlo Test, p<0.05). In conclusion, the morphological and functional response of phytoplankton in Tota Lake is driven by short-term variability in transparency, phosphorus, nitrogen, hardness, and electrical conductivity, which are all affected by seasonal changes in the lake level.

AB The Betaproteobacteria-Euplotes association is an obligatory symbiotic system involving a monophyletic group of ciliate species and two betaproteobacteria species which can be alternatively present. Recent data showed that this relationship has been established more than once and that several symbiont-substitution events took place, revealing a complex and intriguing evolutionary path. Due to the different evolutionary pathways followed by the different symbionts, each bacterial strain could have differentially evolved and/or lost functional traits. Therefore, we performed re-infection experiments, both by phagocytosis and by microinjection, to test the possible functional role of the different bacteria towards the ciliates. Our results confirm that the growth capacity of the host is indissolubly linked to the presence of its original symbionts. Results of the attempts of re-infection by phagocytosis showed that none of the bacteria is able to successfully colonize the host cytoplasm in this way, even if regularly ingested. Re-infection by microinjection succeed only in one case. Such results point to a high degree of specificity in the interactions between bacteria and Euplotes even after the invasion step. Due to a co-evolutive pathway of reciprocal adaptation, different degree of re-colonization ability could have been conserved by the different species and strains of the symbionts.

AB Mobile genomic islands distribute functional traits between microbes and habitats, yet it remains unclear how their proteins adapt to new environments. Here we used a comparative phylogenomic and proteomic approach to show that the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis ANT/505 acquired a genomic island with a functional pathway for pectin catabolism. Bioinformatics and biochemical experiments revealed that this pathway encodes a series of carbohydrate-active enzymes including two multimodular pectate lyases, PelA and PelB. PelA is a large enzyme with a polysaccharide lyase family 1 (PL1) domain and a carbohydrate esterase family 8 domain, and PelB contains a PL1 domain and two carbohydrate-binding domains of family 13. Comparative phylogenomic analyses indicate that the pathway was most likely acquired from terrestrial microbes, yet we observed multi-modular orthologues only in marine bacteria. Proteomic experiments showed that P. haloplanktis ANT/505 secretes both pectate lyases into the environment in the presence of pectin. These multi-modular enzymes may therefore represent a marine innovation that enhances physical interaction with pectins to reduce loss of substrate and enzymes by diffusion. Our results revealed that marine bacteria can catabolize pectin, and highlight enzyme fusion as a potential adaptation that may facilitate microbial consumption of polymeric substrates in aquatic environments.

AB Climate change is poised to alter the distributional limits, center, and size of many species. Traits may influence different aspects of range shifts, with trophic generality facilitating shifts at the leading edge, and greater thermal tolerance limiting contractions at the trailing edge. The generality of relationships between traits and range shifts remains ambiguous however, especially for imperiled fishes residing in xeric riverscapes. Our objectives were to quantify contemporary fish distributions in the Lower Colorado River Basin, forecast climate change by 2085 using two general circulation models, and quantify shifts in the limits, center, and size of fish elevational ranges according to fish traits. We examined relationships among traits and range shift metrics either singly using univariate linear modeling or combined with multivariate redundancy analysis. We found that trophic and dispersal traits were associated with shifts at the leading and trailing edges, respectively, although projected range shifts were largely unexplained by traits. As expected, piscivores and omnivores with broader diets shifted upslope most at the leading edge while more specialized invertivores exhibited minimal changes. Fishes that were more mobile shifted upslope most at the trailing edge, defying predictions. No traits explained changes in range center or size. Finally, current preference explained multivariate range shifts, as fishes with faster current preferences exhibited smaller multivariate changes. Although range shifts were largely unexplained by traits, more specialized invertivorous fishes with lower dispersal propensity or greater current preference may require the greatest conservation efforts because of their limited capacity to shift ranges under climate change.

AB Land use change, especially the transformation of riparian forest to agricultural fields, plays an important role in groundwater quality, yet little is known about the effects of land use change on groundwater invertebrate assemblages and diversity. This study assesses for the first time the effect of land use (agricultural vs. forest use) on the groundwater invertebrate community of four river floodplains representative of variable conditions across SW Europe (the Garonne River in France, and the Bidasoa, Ebro and Tajo Rivers in Spain). Groundwater invertebrate and water samples were collected quarterly in 8-12 piezometers located in each floodplain over a year. Taxonomic and functional diversity indices and ecosystem services (i.e. biogeochemical filtration and particulate organic matter breakdown) were calculated. The taxonomic and functional diversity of groundwater invertebrate communities increased linearly with the increasing surface occupied by riparian forests and decreased under intensified agriculture use. Moreover, the provision of key ecosystem services related to the biogeochemical filtration and particulate organic matter breakdown also increased 2-fold under more natural forest land. According to regression models, this is likely due to the pressure of agricultural practices on groundwater quality, with high concentrations of nitrates and sulphates exerting a negative influence over groundwater invertebrate diversity and their associated ecosystem services. The results of this study have important management implications, and suggest that the presence of large riparian corridors enhances groundwater invertebrate diversity and functionality in floodplains deeply disturbed by agricultural practices.

AB Wetland indicator status (WIS) describes the habitat affinity of plant species and is used in wetland delineations and resource inventories. Understanding how species-level functional traits vary across WIS categories may improve designations, elucidate mechanisms of adaptation, and explain habitat optima and niche. We investigated differences in species-level traits of riparian flora across WIS categories, extending their application to indicate hydrologic habitat. We measured or compiled data on specific leaf area (SLA), stem specific gravity (SSG), seed mass, and mature height of 110 plant species that occur along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, Arizona. Additionally, we measured leaf C-13, N-15, % carbon, % nitrogen, and C/N ratio of 56 species with C3 photosynthesis. We asked the following: (i) How do species-level traits vary over WIS categories? (ii) Does the pattern differ between herbaceous and woody species? (iii) How well do multivariate traits define WIS categories? (iv) Which traits are correlated? The largest trait differences among WIS categories for herbaceous species occurred for SSG, seed mass, % leaf carbon and height, and for woody species occurred for height, SSG, and C-13. SSG increased and height decreased with habitat aridity for both woody and herbaceous species. The C-13 and hence water use efficiency of woody species increased with habitat aridity. Water use efficiency of herbaceous species increased with habitat aridity via greater occurrence of C4 grasses. Multivariate trait assemblages differed among WIS categories. Over all species, SLA was correlated with height, C-13, % leaf N, and C/N; height was correlated with SSG and % leaf C; SSG was correlated with % leaf C. Adaptations of both herbaceous and woody riparian species to wet, frequently inundated habitats include low-density stem tissue. Adaptations to drier habitats in the riparian zone include short, high-density cavitation-resistant stem tissue, and high water use efficiency. The results enhance understanding about using traits to describe plant habitat in riparian systems.

AB Marine benthic organisms can be used as indicators of the quality of environmental status and as monitoring tools to detect natural or anthropogenic perturbations. In temperate waters, metabolic and biochemical responses may be governed by physiological changes driven by seasonal factors. Gathering baseline information on the mechanisms underlying seasonal acclimation patterns is therefore a critical step towards the understanding of the physiological responses of biological indicators. In poikilothermic metazoans, the production of regulatory metabolic enzymes can be used as tools for deciphering the acclimation potential. The aim of this study was to characterize the natural seasonal variability in biometric traits and enzymatic biomarkers over a 12-month period in the sea anemone, Anemonia sulcata (Anthozoa, Cnidaria), from two areas with different environmental and anthropic impacts. Seasonality and site factors affected enzymatic kinetics at tentacle levels, while seasonality, site and biometrical characteristics modulated the same enzymes in the body column of A. sulcata. The results showed a decrease in enzymatic activity in summer and an increased synthesis of enzymes in the late fall and winter months. The interaction between biometric features and temperature appeared significant for mesolittoral sea anemones but not for infralittoral specimens. This study showed seasonal patterns of variations of biochemical responses in A. sulcata, suggesting that this species, an abundant member of shallow rocky bottom communities in temperate European seas, may represent a sensitive bio-indicator organism worth considering for further ecological studies on climate change as well as for environmental monitoring programs.

AB Denitrification is one of the most important processes in the nitrogen (N) cycle due to its permanently removing excess N from ecosystems into the atmosphere. In practice, revegetation has employed to facilitate the process for preventing nitrogen from terrestrial into aquatic ecosystems, in particular in the terrestrial-aquatic ecotone (i.e., riparian zone). However, how revegetation drives the shift in the denitrifying bacterial community and consequently alters denitrification is still unclear. In this study, we investigated soil denitrifiers in three vegetation types with respective dominant species of trees, shrubs and herbs in the water-level-fluctuate-zone in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. We hypothesized that revegetation affected the composition of denitrifiers. Results revealed that the functional gene composition in herb samples was well separated from that in tree samples, which was dependent on the interactions between plant traits (i.e., species number and diversity, root C:N ratio) and environmental factors (i.e., soil temperature and pH). Herb soils has more abundance of nirS and nirK genes and nirS gene diversity due to their higher species number, soil pH, soil organic C, TN, soil C: N ratio and root C: N ratio compared with the shrub and tree soils. Vegetation types did not significantly affect soil denitrification rate, which could be largely explained by the combined effects of plant attributes (species number, root organic C and root N), and soil pH. Our results have demonstrated that herb plantations could increase the abundance of soil denitrifiers through altering both the quantity and quality of SOC and soil pH. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Globalization and climate change trigger species invasions and range shifts, which reshuffle communities at an exceptional rate and expose plant migrants to unfamiliar herbivores. Dominant hypotheses to predict plant success are based on evolutionary novelty: either herbivores are maladapted to consume novel plants (enemy release hypothesis), or novel plants are maladapted to deter herbivores (biotic resistance hypothesis). Since novelty can work both ways, it fails to consistently predict when herbivores will consume novel over non-novel plants. Surprisingly, the value of using plant traits to predict herbivore consumption of novel plants remains largely unexplored. We hypothesized that (i) plant traits explain generalist herbivore consumption rates of novel and non-novel plants, and (ii) any effect of novelty will be grounded in consistent trait differences between native and novel plants. Lastly, we expected to find (iii) differences in plant traits and plant consumption rates across latitude. To test these hypotheses, we measured the consumption rate of plant species for a tropical and a temperate generalist herbivore in controlled feeding trials by offering them a large variety of 40 plant species from different geographical origins. Therefore, whether a plant was novel depended on the herbivore used, allowing us to disentangle plant identity from plant novelty. We also measured plant chemical traits and determined whether traits, geographical origin or novelty best explained herbivore consumption rates. Both generalist herbivores consumed more of plants with a high nitrogen-to-phenolic compounds ratio, irrespective of the plant's novelty to the herbivore. A pattern of increasing plant's nitrogen-to-phenolics ratio with latitude could explain why both the tropical and temperate herbivore consumed more of plants from temperate regions. Plant novelty and its geographical origin no longer explained consumption rates once differences in nitrogen-to-phenolic compounds ratio were taken into account. We show that differences in plant traits along a latitudinal cline determine herbivore consumption rates, irrespective of whether plants are novel or familiar. Therefore, we propose that integrating evolutionary novelty theory with plant traits and biogeography will increase our understanding of the consequences of plant species migration beyond biogeographical barriers.

AB Body feathers ensure both waterproofing and insulation in waterbirds, but how natural variation in the morphological properties of these appendages relates to environmental constraints remains largely unexplored. Here, we test how habitat and thermal condition affect the morphology of body feathers, using a phylogenetic comparative analysis of five structural traits [i.e., total feather length, the lengths of the pennaceous (distal) and plumulaceous (proximal) sections, barb density, and pennaceous barbule density] from a sample of 194 European bird species. Body feather total length is shorter in aquatic than in terrestrial birds, and this difference between groups is due to the shorter plumulaceous feather section in aquatic birds. Indeed, a reduced plumulaceous section in feather length probably reflects the need to limit air trapped in the plumage to adjust the buoyancy of aquatic birds. In contrast, the high pennaceous barbule density of aquatic birds compared to their terrestrial counterparts reflects water resistance of the plumage in contact with water. Our results show that birds living in environments with low ambient temperature have long plumulaceous feather lengths, low barb density, and low pennaceous barbule density. Data also suggest that plumage probably has limited function in reducing the heat absorption of species living in hot environments. Our results have broad implications for understanding the suite of selection pressures driving the evolution of body feather functional morphology. It remains to be tested, however, how other feather traits, such as the density of plumage (feathers per unit area) and the relative number of different feather types, for example downy feathers, are distributed amongst birds with different water resistance and thermoinsulative needs.

AB The natural flow regime of many rivers in the USA has been impacted by anthropogenic structures. This loss of connectivity plays a role in shaping river ecosystems by altering physical habitat characteristics and shaping fish assemblages. Although the impacts of large dams on river systems are well documented, studies on the effects of low-head dams using a functional guild approach have been fewer. We assessed river habitat quality and fish community structure at 12 sites on two rivers; the study sites included two sites below each dam, two sites in the pool above each dam and two sites upstream of the pool extent. Fish communities were sampled from 2012 to 2015 using a multi-gear approach in spring and fall seasons. We aggregated fishes into habitat and reproductive guilds in order to ascertain dams' effects on groups of fishes that respond similarly to environmental variation. We found that habitat quality was significantly poorer in the artificial pools created above the dams than all other sampling sites. Fast riffle specialist taxa were most abundant in high-quality riffle habitats farthest from the dams, while fast generalists and pelagophils were largely restricted to areas below the downstream-most impoundment. Overall, these dams play a substantial role in shaping habitat, which impacts fish community composition on a functional level. Utilizing this functional approach enables us to mechanistically link the effects of impoundments to the structure of fish communities and form generalizations that can be applied to other systems.

AB We have compiled information from scientific articles from the ISI Web of Knowledge database (Thomson Reuters) to monitor trends and identify gaps in the use of functional diversity in studies of macroinvertebrates in stream ecosystems. We identified regions, periodicals, taxa and set of functional traits, which were more frequently used. The use of functional diversity with stream macroinvertebrates has proved to be recent, intended to answer the negative effects of land use on the community, especially of aquatic insects and mainly distributed in the European and North American continents. The meaning of terms used in the functional approach differ from concepts found in earlier studies, which may cause misunderstandings in interpretations and comparisons between articles. In addition to this issue, absence of species lists and functional values, and the combination of binary or continuous data and different taxonomic levels also hinder these comparisons. The standardization of terminology has been proposed previously and would simplify the use of functional traits, facilitating the understanding and the search for articles. We highlight the need for funding agencies to determine measures that force researchers to provide the databases after a certain period of time, thus contributing to the creation of a database in other continents, as has been occurring especially in Europe. Such initiative strengthens research, especially those distributed in areas undergoing intense human pressure.

AB On the North shore of Lake,Erie, Long Point provides habitat to many thousands of breeding and migrating birds, including marsh-nesting species that are in decline across the Great Lakes. Invasive Phragmites australis threatens the ecological integrity of these marshes. Early concerns prompted a study into the effects of invasion on bird use in 2001-2002 that concluded P. australis was not a major bird conservation issue. We evaluate breeding season bird occupancy in these wetlands after over a decade of P. australis expansion, comparing bird diversity and abundance in P. australis with diversity and abundance in the vegetation communities that P. australis is displacing: cattail, meadow, and open-water marsh. We also examine community composition and functional traits to better capture the effects of P. australis invasion. In 2015, total bird abundance was lower in P. australis than cattail marsh (ANOVA p < 0.001), with little difference in bird species richness among vegetation types (ANOVA p = 0.272). Bird community composition was distinct among the vegetation types (MRPP p < 0.001), such that P. australis supported a subset of bird species found within cattail and meadow marsh habitat, rather than novel species. Phragmites australis habitat excludes many marsh-nesting species and provides habitat for shrub-nesting, ground and foliage gleaners instead. Marsh-nesters of conservation concern are restricted to remaining cattail, meadow marsh, and open-water habitat. The full effects of P. australis invasion may exhibit a lag time, and community composition and functional traits should be considered when evaluating the effects of biological invasions.

AB Populations of generalist species often comprise of smaller sub-sets of relatively specialized individuals whose niches comprise small sub-sets of the overall population niche. Here, the role of parasite infections in trophic niche specialization was tested using five wild fish populations infected with the non-native parasite Ergasilus briani, a copepod parasite with a direct lifecycle that infects the gill tissues of fish hosts. Infected and uninfected fishes were sampled from the same habitats during sampling events. Prevalence in the host populations ranged between 16 and 67%, with parasite abundances of up to 66 parasites per fish. Although pathological impacts included hyperplasia and localized haemorrhaging of gill tissues, there were no significant differences in the length, weight and condition of infected and uninfected fishes. Stable isotope analyses (delta C-13, delta N-15) revealed that the trophic niche of infected fishes, measured as standard ellipse area (i.e. the isotopic niche), was consistently and significantly smaller compared with uninfected conspecifics. These niches of infected fishes always sat within that of uninfected fish, suggesting trophic specialization in hosts. These results suggested trophic specialization is a potentially important non-lethal consequence of parasite infection that results from impaired functional traits of the host.

AB Small body size is generally correlated with r-selected life-history traits, including early maturation, short-generation times, and rapid growth rates, that result in high population turnover and a reduced risk of extinction. Unlike other classes of vertebrates, however, small freshwater fishes appear to have an equal or greater risk of extinction than large fishes. We explored whether particular traits explain the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List conservation status of small-bodied freshwater fishes from 4 temperate river basins: Murray-Darling, Australia; Danube, Europe; Mississippi-Missouri, North America; and the Rio Grande, North America. Twenty-three ecological and life-history traits were collated for all 171 freshwater fishes of 120 mm total length. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to assess which combination of the 23 traits best explained whether a species was threatened or not threatened. We used the best models to predict the probability of 29 unclassified species being listed as threatened. With and without controlling for phylogeny at the family level, small body sizeamong small-bodied specieswas the most influential trait correlated with threatened species listings. The k-folds cross-validation demonstrated that body size and a random effect structure that included family predicted the threat status with an accuracy of 78% (SE 0.5). We identified 10 species likely to be threatened that are not listed as such on the IUCN Red List. Small body size is not a trait that provides universal resistance to extinction, particularly for vertebrates inhabiting environments affected by extreme habitat loss and fragmentation. We hypothesize that this is because small-bodied species have smaller home ranges, lower dispersal capabilities, and heightened ecological specialization relative to larger vertebrates. Trait data and further model development are needed to predict the IUCN conservation status of the over 11,000 unclassified freshwater fishes, especially those under threat from proposed dam construction in the world's most biodiverse river basins.

AB Chironomidae (Diptera) are widespread, abundant, diverse and ubiquitous, and include genera and species that are distributed across the Holarctic region. However, the geographical barriers between continents should have resulted in intraspecific population differentiation with reflection on individual biological and ecological traits. Our aim was to test for potential differences in Chironomidae species/genus and traits between the Nearctic and Palearctic regions. We compared the Chironomidae trait information gathered in two databases; one database was developed in Europe and the other in North America. Common genera and species of both databases were selected, and the common traits were adjusted into the same trait categories. Data were transformed into presence/absence and divided into Eltonian (biological/functional) and Grinnellian (ecological) traits. Common genera and common species were analyzed using Fuzzy correspondence analysis (FCA). Differences between databases occur for all trait domains. Yet, Eltonian traits showed lower level of concordance than Grinnellian traits at the species level. Different biological characteristics in the Nearctic and Palearctic regions may indicate that Chironomidae have different adaptions to similar ecological environments due to intraspecific variability or even trait plasticity.

AB Benthic communities play a major role in organic matter remineralization but the role played by macrofauna functional and taxonomic diversity remains elusive. To investigate this topic, we collected sediment cores from two different continental shelf locations near British Columbia, Canada, that differed in diversity to determine how the communities would respond to organic enrichment in the short term (similar to 24 h). We added phytodetritus to half of the cores, measured benthic oxygen and nutrient fluxes in natural and enriched incubations, identified macrofauna, and calculated a suite of functional and taxonomic diversity indices. We found that benthic communities in Saanich Inlet (SI) and the Strait of Georgia East (SoGE) differed significantly in composition and that this difference corresponded to significant differences in benthic flux rates between sites. Multivariate analyses showed that the higher taxonomic (Simpson's diversity) and functional richness (FRic) observed in SoGE explained generally higher benthic flux rates at SoGE compared to SI. In enriched incubations, the higher species richness observed at SoGE explained most of the enhanced benthic flux rates measured in SoGE compared to SI. Our study also identified mean densities of detritivores and omnivores as primary predictors of the higher benthic flux rates measured in enriched incubations in SoGE compared to SI. These results suggest that detritivores and omnivores are the first functional groups of macrofaunal organisms to ingest fresh phytodetritus on the sea floor, and point to their primary importance in short-term remineralization of organic matter following phytoplankton bloom deposition on the seafloor. Our results further indicate that sediments with higher functional diversity may process organic matter and regenerate nutrients more quickly than lower diversity sediments, and that diversity loss may have negative consequences for ecosystem functioning of continental shelf sediments.

AB Although species traits have the potential to disentangle long-term effects of multiple, potentially confounded drivers in ecosystems, this issue has received very little attention in the literature. We aimed at filling this gap by assessing the relative effects of hydroclimatic and water quality factors on the trait composition of invertebrate assemblages over 30 years in the Middle Loire River (France). Using a priori predictions on the long-term variation of trait-based adaptations over the three decades, we evaluated the ability of invertebrate traits to indicate the effects of warming, discharge reduction and water quality improvement. Hydroclimatic and water quality factors contributed to up to 65% of the variation in trait composition. More than 70% of the initial trait response predictions made according to observed long-term hydroclimatic changes were confirmed. They supported a general climate-induced trend involving adapted resistance and resilience strategies. A partial confounding effect of water quality improvement acting on trophic processes was also highlighted, indicating that improved water quality management can significantly help to reduce some adverse effects of climate change. This trait-based approach can have wider implications for investigating long-term changes driven by multiple, potentially confounded factors, as frequently encountered in the context of global change.

AB Habitat discontinuity is one of the main causes of diversity reduction in lotic ecosystems. We tested the predictions of the Serial Discontinuity Concept (SDC) caused by small reservoirs on the functional diversity (FD) of Chironomidae assemblages in Neotropical Savanna streams. We obtained taxonomic information from segments upstream and downstream of small reservoirs. In addition, abiotic variables, such as stream segment width, flow velocity, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, water temperature, and organic matter were measured. We analyzed the Chironomidae assemblage FD using the functional richness (FRic), functional dispersion (FDis), trait relevance, as well as the species richness metrics. We used a non-parametric paired tests to compare differences in the FD indices, species richness, and the abiotic variables between the upstream and downstream segments. The results suggest that there were reductions in the FRic, FDis, species richness, and organic matter percentage below reservoirs. Moreover, depth, width, and dissolved oxygen increased in the downstream segments. The discontinuity length presented a negative influence in the FD indexes toward downstream segments as proposed by the SDC theory. We concluded that the discontinuity length affected the dispersal ability of some Chironomidae taxa, causing richness reduction and dissimilarity in the assemblages' functional traits toward downstream stretches.

AB Drought is the one of the most important environment stresses that restricts crop yield worldwide. Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important food and energy crop that has many desirable traits such as drought, heat and low nutrients tolerance. However, the mechanisms underlying drought tolerance in cassava are unclear. Ethylene signaling pathway, from the upstream receptors to the downstream transcription factors, plays important roles in environmental stress responses during plant growth and development. In this study, we used bioinformatics approaches to identify and characterize candidate Manihot esculenta ethylene receptor genes and transcription factor genes. Using computational methods, we localized these genes on cassava chromosomes, constructed phylogenetic trees and identified stress-responsive cis-elements within their 5' upstream regions. Additionally, we measured the trehalose and proline contents in cassava fresh leaves after drought, osmotic, and salt stress treatments, and then it was found that the regulation patterns of contents of proline and trehalose in response to various dehydration stresses were differential, or even the opposite, which shows that plant may take different coping strategies to deal with different stresses, when stresses come. Furthermore, expression profiles of these genes in different organs and tissues under non-stress and abiotic stress were investigated through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses in cassava. Expression profiles exhibited clear differences among different tissues under non-stress and various dehydration stress conditions. We found that the leaf and tuberous root tissues had the greatest and least responses, respectively, to drought stress through the ethylene signaling pathway in cassava. Moreover, tuber and root tissues had the greatest and least reponses to osmotic and salt stresses through ethylene signaling in cassava, respectively. These results show that these plant tissues had differential expression levels of genes involved in ethylene signaling in response to the stresses tested. Moreover, after several gene duplication events, the spatiotemporally differential expression pattern of homologous genes in response to abiotic and biotic stresses may imply their functional diversity as a mechanism for adapting to the environment. Our data provide a framework for further research on the molecular mechanisms of cassava resistance to drought stress and provide a foundation for breeding drought-resistant new cultivars.

AB Benthic diatoms have been widely used to assess the ecological status of freshwater ecosystems, especially in the context of recent international water framework directive policies (e.g. the WFD). Despite diatom-based indices are known to respond fastly to water quality degradation, they are not designed to precisely identify the nature of pressures co-occurring in the environment. Based on large scale monitoring data, we aimed at building models able to estimate the risk of stream impairment by many types of anthropogenic pressures from taxonomy based and trait-based characteristics of diatom assemblages. Random forest models were built to individually evaluate the impairment risk of diatom assemblages for six chemical and five hydromorphological or land-use related pressure categories. Eight models provided good impairment risk assessment (Area Under the Curve >= 0.70). Under multi-pressure scenarios, models built for chemical pressures exhibited a better accuracy than hydromorphological or land-use related ones. Models were able to detect both ecological restoration and degradation, based on long-term surveys. These models have been implemented in a R user-friendly routine, to help stream managers to early identify degrading processes and prioritize management actions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB There is an implicit requirement under contemporary policy drivers to understand the characteristics of benthic communities under anthropogenically-unimpacted scenarios. We used a trait-based approach on a large dataset from across the European shelf to determine how functional characteristics of unimpacted benthic assemblages vary between different sedimentary habitats.
   Assemblages in deep, muddy environments unaffected by anthropogenic disturbance show increased proportions of downward conveyors and surface deposit-feeders, while burrowing, diffusive mixing, scavenging and predation traits assume greater numerical proportions in shallower habitats. Deep, coarser sediments are numerically more dominated by sessile, upward conveyors and suspension feeders. In contrast, unimpacted assemblages of coarse sediments in shallower regions are proportionally dominated by the diffusive mixers, burrowers, scavengers and predators. Finally, assemblages of gravelly sediments exhibit a relatively greater numerical dominance of non-bioturbators and asexual reproducers. These findings may be used to form the basis of ranking habitats along a functional sensitivity gradient. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important staple crops providing near half of the global population. With the advance of living standards, people demand for novel rice varieties with better quality of eating and fragrance. Unfortunately, the practical application of pesticides to control rice stripe disease results a significant deterioration of rice quality and nutrition. Therefore, it is an urgent need to develop disease resistant rice varieties with good eating quality and fragrance. Here, we present the strategy and practical development of a new rice variety, Shangshida No. 15, by molecular marker assisted gene pyramiding. 'Shangshida No. 15' displayed the aroma trait and the same good eating quality phenotypes as that of Jinfeng rice, a famous rice variety for its good eating quality and high yield in the Yangtze River region of China. Shangshida No. 15 exhibited significantly higher average plant height and 1000-grain weight, while its growth duration was approximately 2 weeks shorter than those of Jinfeng. In conclusion, our study demonstrated a breeding strategy for obtaining high quality rice through molecular marker-assisted gene pyramiding, and the resulting new variety could facilitate further attempts to develop more high eating quality rice varieties together with stripe disease-resistant traits without affecting yields.

AB Trait-based approaches have become increasingly successful in community ecology. They assume that the distribution of functional traits within communities responds in a predictable way to alterations in environmental forcing and that strong forcing may accelerate such trait changes. We used high frequency measurements of phytoplankton to test these assumptions. We analyzed the seasonal and long-term dynamics of the community trait mean within a multi-dimensional trait space under alternating multifactorial environmental conditions. The community trait mean exhibited a distinct recurrent annual pattern that reflected minor changes in climate, herbivory and nutrients. Independent of early spring conditions, the community trait mean was repeatedly driven into a narrow confined area in the trait space under pronounced herbivory during the clear water phase. The speed of movement was highest at the onset and the relaxation of such strong unidirectional forcing. Thus, our data support the conceptual framework of trait-based ecology that alterations in environmental conditions are systematically tracked by adjustments in the dominant functional trait values and that the speed of trait changes depends on the kind and intensity of the selection pressure. Our approach provides a sensitive tool to detect small functional differences in the community related to subtle differences in forcing.

AB It has been suggested that the overwhelming number of species in tropical ecosystems consist largely of "neutral" and functionally equivalent species. In phytoplankton, differences in functionality have been shown to be clearly distinguishable from morphological traits. Here we examine whether the increase in species towards the tropics goes together with an increase in functional richness or not. We analyse the latitudinal distribution of phytoplankton morphology-based functional groups (MBFG), the within-group richness and community morphological traits in 83 shallow lakes across South America (5-55A degrees S). We further looked into explaining environmental variables. Despite the increment in species richness towards the (sub)tropics, the average number of MBFG remained constant. Furthermore, size average and variance decreased towards warmer regions. In warm lakes, phytoplankton communities were species rich but redundant in terms of belonging to a MBFG. Increasing species richness only translated into increasing number of rare species in some of the MBFG. In contrast, cold lakes were species poor but less redundant (i.e. essential to maintain the number of MBFG) and had a higher morphological variability. Our results support the hypothesis of higher functional redundancy in warmer areas and the relevance of increasing herbivory in colder regions as a main driving process of latitudinal patterns.

AB Starting in September 2010, a monitoring program was developed for evaluating the water quality in six artificial lakes (reservoirs) of the Apulia Region (Southern Italy). Lake ecological status was evaluated according to the requirements of the 2000/60/EC Water Framework Directive. Phytoplankton taxonomic composition, biovolume and chlorophyll a data were used in an application of the Italian methods (Italian Phytoplankton Assessment Method or New Italian Method) for water quality assessment of artificial lakes. Even though all the reservoirs were classified as being in good ecological status, the phytoplankton communities of the six reservoirs were different and characterized by highly site-specific components and by distinctive dominant taxa. The influences of environmental variables on the phytoplankton communities were analyzed. Results of Constrained Coordinate Analysis (CCA) indicated strong influences of the trophic gradient and water depth on the phytoplankton assemblages, but significant factors are also the surrounding landscape and the origin and the history of the lakes. A functional traits-based analysis was carried out to support the water quality assessment tools. Twenty-one morpho-functional groups were identified. Most of them were common in all six lakes, so functional properties clearly recur among different phytoplankton species.

AB High environmental variability is a feature of transitional water ecosystems, which also affects temporal and spatial patterns of phytoplankton. The Lagoon of Venice is characterised by a wide range of environmental conditions, high phytoplankton species diversity and abundance variability. Here we focus on morphological traits and specifically, for the first time in transitional waters, on phytoplankton geometric shape. Our hypothesis is that despite high taxonomic diversity, the prevalent features of the lagoon (shallow, permanently nutrient-enriched, turbulent and light-attenuated) should select a small number of dominant morphological types and adaptive strategies. We tested the hypothesis on a 13-year (1998-2010) phytoplankton data series and related abiotic factors. Seven shapes were found to be dominant and widespread in space and time in the lagoon, with two adaptive strategies: high surface area-to-volume ratio (S/V) together with low greatest axial linear dimension (GALD), and low S/V together with high GALD. Certain morphological traits, which allow a high S/V (from 0.8 to > 1), appear quite constant: (i) small size (GALD < 15 mu m), in particular in round-shaped organisms, and (ii) high GALD together with shape attenuation, within the same species or across a range of species. We observed that the lagoon regime selects for the coexistence of competing species with similar morphological traits.

AB In the context of maintenance of biodiversity and ecological functions, microbial ecologists face the challenge of linking individual level variability in functional traits to larger scale ecosystem processes. Phytoplankton cell size and shape are key traits under selection by environmental filters and species interactions. Spatial differences in resource availability shape species diversity according to their use efficiency. Niche partitioning promotes plankton diversity. Here, we explore how size and shape enter the diversity game. How does taxonomic and morpho-functional community structure vary at different spatial scales? What are the potential drivers shaping the structure of phytoplankton communities? We explore these questions by looking at the individual level variability in taxonomic and morphological traits in a biogeographical snapshot of natural phytoplankton communities in coastal ecosystems around the globe. We found that taxonomic variability is mainly concentrated at local and regional levels, whereas shape and size variability are mainly concentrated at a local level, despite the environmental heterogeneity of ecosystems. Species diversity was more variable than trait diversity from local to global spatial scales. We suggest that structural organization of phytoplankton communities in coastal ecosystems may follow a hierarchical pattern of trait organization, where a different combination of multiple functional traits may represent effective strategies and promote success under given environmental conditions as a resolution of Hutchinson's paradox.

AB More freshwater ecosystems are drying in response to global change thereby posing serious threat to freshwater biota and functions. The production of desiccation-resistant forms is an important adaptation that helps maintain biodiversity in temporary freshwaters by buffering communities from drying, but its potential to mitigate the negative effects of drying in freshwater ecosystems could vary greatly across regions and ecosystem types. We explored this context dependency by quantifying the potential contribution of desiccation-resistance forms to invertebrate community recovery across levels of regional drying prevalence (defined as the occurrence of drying events in freshwaters in a given region) and ecosystem types (lentic, lotic) in temporary neotropical freshwaters. We first predicted that regional drying prevalence influences the selection of species with desiccation-resistant forms from the regional species pools and thus increases the ability of communities to recover from drying. Second, we predicted lentic freshwaters harbor higher proportions of species with desiccation-resistant forms compared to lotic, in response to contrasted hydrologic connectivity. To test these predictions, we used natural experiments to quantify the contribution of desiccation-resistant forms to benthic invertebrate community recovery in nine intermittent streams and six geographically isolated temporary wetlands from three Bolivian regions differing in drying prevalence. The contribution of desiccation-resistant forms to community recovery was highest where regional drying prevalence was high, suggesting the species pool was adapted to regional disturbance regimes. The contribution of desiccation-resistant forms to community recovery was lower in streams than in wetlands, emphasizing the importance of hydrologic connectivity and associated recolonization processes from in-stream refuges to recovery in lotic systems. In all regions, the majority of functional traits were present in desiccation-resistant taxa indicating this adaptation may help maintain ecosystem functions by buffering communities from the loss of functional traits. Accounting for regional context and hydrologic connectivity in community recovery processes following drying can help refine predictions of freshwater biodiversity response to global change.

AB The purpose of the study described in this Research Communication was to report the full characterisation of the goat and sheep oxytocin-neurophysin I gene (OXT), their promoters and amino acid sequences. Using the genomic DNA as template, we sequenced and compared the whole OXT gene (3 exons), plus 958/960 nucleotides at the 5' flanking region and 478/477 nucleotides at the 3' flanking region, in 46 sheep and 24 goats belonging to different breeds/genetic types reared in Italy, Greece and Germany. The comparison of the obtained sequences showed a high degree of genetic variability at these loci. In particular, we focused on the SNP g.438T > C as possible example of trans-specific polymorphism. This SNP alters a putative binding site of the transcription factor Oct-1. The set-up of a luciferase assay confirmed that the C variant of this SNP negatively affects the promoter activity of the sheep OXT gene. The results of this study suggest that the SNP g.438T > C might be useful to promote association studies with traits/physiological processes controlled by this hormone.

AB 1. Natural systems are exposed to compounded perturbations, whose changes in temporal variance can be as important as those in mean intensity for shaping the structure of assemblages. Specifically, climate-related physical disturbances and nutrient inputs due to natural and/or anthropogenic activities occur concomitantly, but experimental tests of the simultaneous effects of changes in the regime of more than one perturbation are generally lacking. Filling this gap is the key to understand ecological responses of natural assemblages to climate-related change in the intensity and temporal patterning of physical disturbance combined with other global stressors.
   2. Responses to factorial manipulations of nutrient enrichment, mean intensity and temporal variability in storm-like mechanical disturbance were examined, using benthic assemblages of tide-pools as model system.
   3. Response variables were mean abundance values and temporal variances of taxa with different life-traits. Consistent negative effects of disturbance intensity were observed for the mean cover of long-living taxa (algal canopies and the polychaete Sabellaria alveolata), whose temporal fluctuations were also reduced by more severe mechanical stress. More resilient taxa (ephemeral algae, mostly green of the genus Ulva) increased under enriched conditions, particularly when low-intensity events were irregularly applied over time. Opposite effects of disturbance intensity depending on nutrient availability occurred on filamentous algae (e.g. red of the genus Ceramium). This was probably due to the fact that, although nutrient enrichment stimulated the abundance of both algal groups, when this condition was combined with relatively mild physical disturbance the competitively superior ephemeral green algae tended to become dominant over filamentous red algae. The same did not occur under high intensity of disturbance since it likely damaged large, foliose fronds of Ulva-like forms more than small, filamentous fronds of Ceramium-like forms. Grazers were positively affected by nutrients, likely responding indirectly to more food available.
   4. A direct relationship between the mean abundance of most organisms and their temporal fluctuations was documented. However, all organisms persisted throughout the study, even under experimental conditions associated to the largest temporal variation in their abundance, likely due to their ability to resist to/quickly recover from, the applied perturbations. Therefore, in systems with great recovery abilities of dominant organisms (e.g. rocky intertidal, grasslands), effects of traits of the regime of disturbance and nutrient enrichment may modulate the fluctuations of populations not through the elimination and substitution of species, but through changes in relative abundances of the same species. This contrasts with the theory that temporal variation in abundance would be directly related to the risk of local extinction. Present findings enable more accurate predictions of the consequences of climatic and non-climatic scenarios on the biodiversity of marine and terrestrial systems sharing analogous functional traits of organisms. Future more intense physical disturbances are expected to exert negative effects on slow-growing/recovering species (e.g. habitat-formers) irrespectively of the temporal patterning of the same disturbances and nutrient inputs. On the contrary, more resistant species (e.g. encrusting algae on rocky shores or below-ground vegetation in grasslands) are expected to benefit from intense physical disturbance. Species whose abundance is more directly related to the availability of nutrients (e.g. filamentous and ephemeral algae or herbs) are expected to generally increase under enriched conditions, but their ability to eventually become dominant would depend on their ability to grow fast and attain cover large enough to overwhelm any possible control of concomitant disturbance intensity on their abundance. If, such as in the present examined system, virtually all organisms can persist, over the temporal scale of the experiment, under any combination of physical disturbance and nutrient availability, the resulting overall diversity is not predicted to change drastically. Nevertheless, low-intensity events evenly distributed and high-intensity events irregularly distributed appear as the conditions supporting the highest richness of taxa, independently of the availability of nutrients.

AB 1. Trait-based approaches for studying community assembly have improved understanding of mechanisms; however, the challenge of interpreting process from pattern is complicated by the possibility of multiple mechanisms operating simultaneously. Different traits may influence the assembly process in different ways. Analysing patterns of functional diversity among co-occurring species for each trait individually may aid interpretation of complex assembly processes; yet, few studies have tested whether patterns vary depending on trait function.
   2. We used tropical fish assemblages from the Xingu River, Brazil to test whether traits associated with resource acquisition play a stronger role in niche segregation relative to other traits. First, a null modelling approach was used to determine how trait distributions within local assemblages deviated from expectations under random assembly. Then, correlations between functional traits and stable isotope ratios (C-13, N-15) were used as a measure of a trait's association with trophic structure. Finally, we used mixed effects models to test whether traits having higher correlations with trophic structure also had greater deviation from null expectations. In addition, we explored how well stable isotopes explain multivariate functional trait variation and compared our correlation-based approach for organizing traits with previous categorical approaches.
   3. A significant relationship was found between a trait's deviation from null expectations and its correlation with isotopic patterns. Traits strongly associated with trophic structure had greater dispersion from the assemblage mean and were more evenly spaced than weakly associated traits. Traits strongly associated with trophic structure also were more clustered because trophic diversification tended to occur around some basic feeding strategies, such as benthic grazing or capturing food items from the water column. Based on redundancy analysis, isotopic ratios explained a low (116%) but significant portion of trait variation.
   4. In this study system, traits strongly associated with trophic ecology were more influential in niche differentiation among coexisting species compared to weakly associated traits. These results suggest that certain traits may respond to assembly mechanisms in predictable ways despite the complex, multidimensional nature of the assembly process. Methods designed to identify differential trait response will be critical to developing a general theory of trait-based community assembly.

AB This paper aims to improve our understanding of the phylogenetic trait polarity related to hominin forearm evolution, in particular those traits traditionally defined as "Neandertal features." To this aim, twelve adult and adolescent fragmented forelimb elements (including ulnae and radii) of Homo neanderthalensis recovered from the site of El Sidron (Asturias, Spain) were examined comparatively using three-dimensional geometric and traditional morphometrics. Mean centroid size and shape comparisons, principal components analysis, and phylogenetic signal analysis were undertaken. Our investigations revealed that the proximal region of the ulna discriminated best between Neandertals and modern humans, with fewer taxonomically-informative features in the distal ulna and radius. Compared to modern humans, the divergent features in the Neandertal ulna are an increase in olecranon breadth (a derived trait), lower coronoid length (primitive), and anterior orientation of the trochlear notch (primitive). In the Neandertal radius, we observe a larger neck length (primitive), medial orientation of the radial tubercle (secondarily primitive), and a curved diaphysis (secondarily primitive). Anatomically, we identified three units of evolutionary change: 1) the olecranon and its fossa, 2) the coronoid-radius neck complex, and 3) the tubercle and radial diaphysis. Based on our data, forearm evolution followed a mosaic pattern in which some features were inherited from a pre-Homo ancestor, others originated in some post-ergaster and pre-antecessor populations, and other characters emerged in the specific Homo sapiens and H. neanderthalensis lineages, sometimes appearing as secondarily primitive. Future investigations might consider the diverse phylogenetic origin of apomorphies while at the same time seeking to elucidate their functional meaning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims Landscape fragmentation has strong negative consequences on biodiversity. In networks of linear elements, connectivity loss results in a decreased length of connected elements and increased potential barriers, directly impacting the ability of plants to disperse. However, species vary in their tolerance to connectivity loss, likely due to differences in dispersal strategies. We investigated whether species tolerance to decreased ditch network connectivity is determined by seed traits. We selected, as a case study, water-dispersed plant species in a ditch network.
   Location Ditch network in an intensive agricultural area in northern France.
   Methods We selected 27 sites of 500mx500m, where we calculated connectivity indices based on the length of connected ditches, intersections and culvert number. For each parameter, we calculated plant tolerance levels by analysing species changes in occurrence in response to change in connectivity values. Concurrently, we measured in laboratory conditions five seed traits involved in plant movement and establishment in standing aquatic systems and analysed their explanatory power in plant tolerance to fragmentation.
   Results All traits were significantly related to at least one component of ditch network connectivity. We interpreted the following two strategies in plant tolerance to connectivity loss from the results: (1) in networks where the connected network length was short, plants displayed short-distance dispersal with less efficient sexual reproduction, probably in favour of local vegetative multiplication; and (2) in networks with a high density of culverts or intersections, plants displayed seeds with reduced local retention, where seeds had the capacity to overcome long and frequent trapping events. In highly branched networks, plants also exhibited higher germination rates, promoting seed establishment when trapped along the banks. Seed capacity to be dispersed by wind at the water surface was only a marginal factor in plant tolerance to fragmentation.
   Conclusions Connectivity loss acted as a filter on species seed traits. The results of our study offer an enhanced understanding of plant dispersal in fragmented standing aquatic networks and emphasize the importance of developing functional approaches in landscape studies.

AB Both physical-chemical and biological indicators are used to assess the ecological health of ecosystems. The functional trait composition of communities has the potential to predict the impact of environmental change on ecosystems, yet, we miss evidence that information on pollution can be used to forecast the functional responses of freshwater communities. We used chemical and ecological data collected in the Nestore river basin (Central Italy) to test whether (i) there are generalities in the response of macroinvertebrate functional diversity to river pollution; (ii) water pollution filters certain functional traits and (iii) traits do better than chemical analyses at revealing ecological stress in rivers. Due to interactions with hydrology, chemical variables showed higher seasonal variation at impacted sites, so occasional water samples represented snapshots. Functional traits did well at detecting water pollution by various chemicals, and there was a clear shift of trait combinations from unimpacted to impacted sites. Anthropogenic disturbances homogenized benthic communities in terms of taxonomic and functional composition, both in space (impacted sites) and time (seasons). Traits related to feeding habits (mainly reliance on fine particulate organic matter) and tolerance to organic pollution were prevalent at impacted reaches, and functional trait compositions were more stable than water chemistry over seasons because they integrate environmental conditions over longer time periods. Functional traits can play a relevant role in the bioassessment of polluted river ecosystems, even under low to moderate disturbance. Trait-based assessment can be complemented by chemical analyses, notably at highly polluted sites where biological diversity drops to its lowest levels. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Ponto-Caspian peracarids (amphipods, isopods, mysids and cumaceans) represent one of the most successful groups of aquatic invaders comprising several high-impact species, such as Chelicorophium curvispinum, Dikerogammarus villosus, or Hemimysis anomala. In the present study we made the first attempt to compare biological traits and the environmental preferences of invasive and non-invasive members of the group based on both literature and field data (Joint Danube Survey 3, 2013) with the goal of identifying factors linked to invasion success and drawing conclusions on future invasion risks. Both datasets indicated substrate preference as an important factor in spontaneous range expansion; all invasive species are lithophilous, whereas the majority of non-invasives are psammo-pelophilous. The remaining seven presently non-invasive lithophilous species deserve special attention when considering potential future invaders; however, due to their rarity and possible negative interactions with earlier colonists we consider the probability of their expansion in the foreseeable future as low. Their potential expansion could most likely be of minor consequence anyway, since no considerable functional novelty can be attributed to them in addition to species already present. In this limited context (regarding habitats dominated by hard substrates and not considering the potential further spread of already invasive species) it might be justified to conclude that 'the worst is over'. Nevertheless, impending navigation development projects both in the Danube-Main-Rhine and Dnieper-Pripyat-Bug-Vistula systems might favour the future spread of non-lithophilous species, which might imply a new invasion wave of Ponto-Caspian peracarids.

AB We evaluated changes in the succession process in benthic algal communities of an afforested stream by comparing them with those in a grassland stream through analysis of temporal changes in composition, structure and functional traits in a 3-month experiment. We hypothesized that sunlight intensity reduction as a result of streamside implanted tree shading reduces the succession rate and community physiognomic complexity. We selected two streams with different riparian cover (grassland and pine afforestation) for installation of unglazed tiles as artificial substrates. The tiles were collected from each stream after 23, 45 and 73 days of exposure. Afforestation produced changes in algal succession, with lower biomass, lower diversity at the beginning of the experiment, and an increase in the proportion of small, low-profile, tolerant, unicellular and stalked algae, coinciding with the predominance of Achnanthidium. However, the grassland stream contained a higher proportion of intermediate-size algae, as well as a larger proportion of high-profile algae, coinciding with the expected results. In the afforested stream, succession proceeded toward the dominance of low-profile species, that were tolerant of low-light conditions. However, in grassland streams with higher sunlight availability, high-profile algae prevailed without the displacement of tolerant forms. Overall, our results indicate that algal communities in afforested stream remain structurally simpler.

AB The Biocoenosis of Well Sorted Fine Sands (WSFS) (SFBC, Sables Fins Bien Calibres in French) is a Mediterranean community very well delimited by bathymetry (2-25 m) and sedimentology (>90% of fine sand) occurring in zones with relatively strong hydrodynamics. In this study focused on sites located along the Algerian, French, Italian and Spanish coasts of the Western Basin of the Mediterranean Sea (WBMS) we aim to compare the structure, ecological status and diversity of the macrofauna of the WSFS and examine the effects of recent human pressures on the state of this shallow macrobenthic community. We assess the ecological status and functioning of these WSFS using three categories of benthic indices: a) five indices based on classification of species into ecological groups, AMBI, BO2A, BPOFA, IQ and IP, b) the ITI index based on classification of species in trophic groups, and c) the Shannon H' index, and the Biological Traits Analysis (BTA), which is an alternative method to relative taxon composition analysis and integrative indices. Cluster analyses show that each zone show a particular taxonomic richness and dominant species. The seven benthic indices reveal that the macrobenthos of the WSFS of the four coastal zones show good or high Quality Status, except for one location on the Algerian coast (the Djendjen site) in 1997. BTA highlights the presence of three groups of species: 1) typical characteristic species; 2) indicator species of enrichment of fine particles and organic matter, and 3) coarsesand species which are accessorily found on fine sand. Finally, the WSFS which are naturally subject to regular natural physical perturbations show a high resilience after human pressures but are very sensitive to changes in the input of organic matter.

AB Biodiversity change in anthropogenically transformed habitats is often nonrandom, yet the nature and importance of the different mechanisms shaping community structure are unclear. Here, we extend the classic Theory of Island Biogeography (TIB) to account for nonrandom processes by incorporating species traits and phylogenetic relationships into a study of faunal relaxation following habitat loss and fragmentation. Two possible mechanisms can create nonrandom community patterns on fragment islands. First, small and isolated islands might consist of similar or closely related species because they are environmentally homogeneous or select for certain shared traits, such as dispersal ability. Alternatively, communities on small islands might contain more dissimilar or distantly related species than on large islands because limited space and resource availability result in greater competitive exclusion among species with high niche overlap. Breeding birds were surveyed on 36 islands and two mainland sites annually from 2010 to 2014 in the Thousand Island Lake region, China. We assessed community structure of breeding birds on these subtropical land-bridge islands by integrating species' trait and evolutionary distances. We additionally analysed habitat heterogeneity and variance in size ratios to distinguish biotic and abiotic processes of community assembly. Results showed that functional-phylogenetic diversity increased with island area, and decreased with isolation. Bird communities on the mainland were more diverse and generally less clustered than island bird communities and not different than randomly assembled communities. Bird communities on islands tend to be functionally similar and phylogenetically clustered, especially on small and isolated islands. The nonrandom decline in species diversity and change in bird community structure with island area and isolation, along with the relatively homogeneous habitats on small islands, support the environmental filtering hypothesis. Our study demonstrates the importance of integrating multiple forms of diversity for understanding the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, and further reveals that TIB could be extended to community measures by moving beyond assumptions of species equivalency in colonisation rates and extinction susceptibilities.

AB 1. Across environmental gradients, some functional strategies are favoured over others resulting in differences in local species composition and distribution of any given functional trait. This generates among-Species Trait Variability (STV) across the gradient (reflecting species turnover), as well as spatial Intraspecific Trait Variability (ITV), which together contribute to Community Trait Variability (CTV). Understanding functional trait responses of freshwater biota is critical for elucidating the mechanisms that operate during community assembly and addressing community level responses to climate warming.
   2. In freshwater insects, temperature and ecological conditions regulate growth rates. Here, we examined size-related trait variability components of short-dispersing stoneflies (Insecta: Plecoptera) within and among multispecies stonefly assemblages (henceforth referred to as communities), located along an elevational gradient in Sierra Nevada (Spain) to assess the components of trait-elevation matching (STV, ITV, CTV).
   3. Relative to downstream reaches, headwaters hypothetically show greater internal physical habitat heterogeneity (large exposed rocks, tree roots, woody debris) and greater local species richness of cool-water adapted stoneflies. As a result, we expected CTV to increase with elevation, with a higher contribution of STV than ITV in upper reaches due to higher species richness and trait divergence among them. In contrast, the pattern of ITV should vary depending on whether the main driver across elevation is species richness (decrease due to niche partitioning) or ecological conditions (increase associated to physical habitat heterogeneity).
   4. Eleven streams were sampled every 2 weeks over 1 year and five size-related traits were measured on 6,893 individuals belonging to 16 species. Overall, STV made a much larger contribution to CTV than ITV, which only became an important contributor in species-poor assemblages, especially in winter and autumn. Within each season, the trait-elevation matching was weak. Functional species-specific responses to the elevational gradient most often did not mirror the response of the entire communities, since highly variable (and even opposed or discontinuous) contributions to ITV were found across species.
   5. Overall, ITV contributed little to trait-elevation matching, which suggests high vulnerability of short-dispersing stoneflies to habitat shifting associated to future climate warming due to limited phenotypic plasticity. Moreover, varying functional trait patterns across species emphasise species-specific responses to climate change as opposed to a unique whole community response. However, further trait-based macroecological studies across freshwater macroinvertebrates lineages are needed to compare patterns and establish generalisations.

AB 1. In-stream nitrate removal capacity may be used as a proxy for the ecosystem service of water quality regulation. It is well known that this natural function is driven by abiotic and biotic factors in running water environments. With regard to biotic drivers, most of the literature focuses on the microbial community influences, but there has been very little emphasis on the relationship with the benthic macroinvertebrate community. Since this community feeds on microbial assemblages (autotrophic and/or heterotrophic biofilms) that live on the streambed and in the hyporheic zone of the river, macroinvertebrates also have the potential to influence nitrate removal via its influences on microbiological processes.
   2. The objective of this study was to examine the potential relationship between the macroinvertebrate communities and nitrate removal. A dataset of in-stream nitrate removal rates measured in nine-third-order streams was analysed. The simultaneous influences of abiotic (hydromorphological, physical and chemical characteristics) and biotic (biofilm and macroinvertebrate) drivers were examined and together explained 56% of the in-stream nitrate removal variance. An analysis of the independent contributions of each driver showed that abiotic drivers (e.g. ammonium, dissolved organic carbon, temperature and transient zone) contributed 40% of this nitrate removal variance, whereas the macroinvertebrate community contributed 39%.
   3. The potential relationship between macroinvertebrates and nitrate removal was subsequently explored using trait-based approaches of the macroinvertebrate community. This method allows for the selection of trait modalities assuming a top-down control of microbial communities by macroinvertebrates, with in-stream abiotic conditions correlated with nitrate removal (assuming that environmental conditions affect macroinvertebrate community composition).
   4. The main trait modalities positively correlated with nitrate removal were scraper (feeding habit), flagstones/boulders/cobbles/pebbles (substrate preference), crawler and interstitial (locomotion) and detritus (food). The main modalities negatively correlated with nitrate removal were silt and mud with microphytes (as substrate preference), and with fine sediment with microorganisms, and dead animals (as food sources). These results agreed with the hypothesis of top-down control and enhanced understanding of the influence of hydromorphological factors on nitrate removal.
   5. This study highlights the involvement of the macroinvertebrate community in in-stream nitrate processing, and demonstrates the usefulness of applying a functional approach to explain relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function.

AB In Lake Tanganyika, several lineages of cichlids have diversified into 200 species. Tribe Tropheini contains the greatest richness of herbivorous species that are classified into four ecomorphs: grazers, browsers, suckers, and pickers. All of these ecomorphs coexist on littoral rocky shores. To reveal the differences among species within ecomorphs, we analysed fish shape and functional morphology related to feeding habits, using geometric morphometrics, and measured intestine length. Furthermore, we tested the relationship between genetic and morphological distances. As a result, diversities of functional morphology among ecomorphs, and among species within ecomorphs, were revealed. In grazers, morphological diversity was greatest in jaws and the opening direction of mouth, suggesting that these species have adapted to feed on various substrata. In browsers, intestine length varied among species, indicating that this ecomorph consists of species with various specializations in herbivory. Morphological divergence was found only in the mandible and occlusal facet in grazers. No clear relation was found between morphological and phylogenetic distances in browsers, which are a polyphyletic group, indicating that their traits were acquired by convergence in multiple lineages. Our data suggest that the observed morphological variation among species enable sympatric species to separate their feeding niches.

AB Integrating knowledge of environmental degradation, biodiversity change, and ecosystem processes across large spatial scales remains a key challenge to illuminating the resilience of earth's systems. There is now a growing realization that the manner in which communities will respond to anthropogenic impacts will ultimately control the ecosystem consequences. Here, we examine the response of freshwater fishes and their nutrient excretion -a key ecosystem process that can control aquatic productivity -to human land development across the contiguous United States. By linking a continental-scale dataset of 533 fish species from 8100 stream locations with species functional traits, nutrient excretion, and land remote sensing, we present four key findings. First, we provide the first geographic footprint of nutrient excretion by freshwater fishes across the United States and reveal distinct local-and continental-scale heterogeneity in community excretion rates. Second, fish species exhibited substantial response diversity in their sensitivity to land development; for native species, the more tolerant species were also the species contributing greater ecosystem function in terms of nutrient excretion. Third, by modeling increased land-use change and resultant shifts in fish community composition, land development is estimated to decrease fish nutrient excretion in the majority (63%) of ecoregions. Fourth, the loss of nutrient excretion would be 28% greater if biodiversity loss was random or 84% greater if there were no nonnative species. Thus, ecosystem processes are sensitive to increased anthropogenic degradation but biotic communities provide multiple pathways for resistance and this resistance varies across space.

AB One of the major contemporary challenges in microbial ecology has been to discriminate the reactive core from the random, unreactive components of bacterial communities. In previous work we used the spatial abundance distributions of bacterioplankton across boreal lakes of Quebec to group taxa into four distinct categories that reflect either hydrology-mediated dispersal along the aquatic network or environmental selection mechanisms within lakes. Here, we test whether this categorization derived from the spatial distribution of taxa is maintained over time, by analyzing the temporal dynamics of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within those spatially derived categories along an annual cycle in the oligotrophic lake Croche (Quebec, Canada), and assessing the coherence in the patterns of abundance, occurrence, and environmental range of these OTUs over space and time. We report that the temporal dynamics of most taxa within a single lake are largely coherent with those derived from their spatial distribution over large spatial scales, suggesting that these properties must be intrinsic of particular taxa. We also identified a set of rare taxa cataloged as having a random occupancy based on their spatial distribution, but which showed clear seasonality and abundance peaks along the year, yet these comprised a very small fraction of the total rare OTUs. We conclude that the presence of most rare bacterioplankton taxa in boreal lakes is random, since both their temporal and spatial dynamics suggest links to passive downstream transport and persistence in freshwater networks, rather than environmental selection.

AB Declining biodiversity and loss of ecosystem function threatens the ability of habitats to contribute ecosystem services. However, the form of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) and how relationships change with environmental change is poorly understood. This limits our ability to predict the consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem function, particularly in real-world marine ecosystems that are species rich, and where multiple ecosystem functions are represented by multiple indicators. We investigated spatial variation in BEF relationships across a 300 000 m(2) intertidal sandflat by nesting experimental manipulations of sediment pore water nitrogen concentration into sites with contrasting macro-benthic community composition. Our results highlight the significance of many different elements of biodiversity associated with environmental characteristics, community structure, functional diversity, ecological traits or particular species (ecosystem engineers) to important functions of coastal marine sediments (benthic oxygen consumption, ammonium pore water concentrations and flux across the sediment-water interface). Using the BEF relationships developed from our experiment, we demonstrate patchiness across a landscape in functional performance and the potential for changes in the location of functional hot and cold spots with increasing nutrient loading that have important implications for mapping and predicating change in functionality and the concomitant delivery of ecosystem services.

AB Colossoma macropomum, or tambaqui, is the largest native Characiform species found in the Amazon and Orinoco river basins, yet few resources for genetic studies and the genetic improvement of tambaqui exist. In this study, we identified a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for tambaqui and constructed a high-resolution genetic linkage map from a full-sib family of 124 individuals and their parents using the genotyping by sequencing method. In all, 68,584 SNPs were initially identified using minimum minor allele frequency (MAF) of 5%. Filtering parameters were used to select high-quality markers for linkage analysis. We selected 7,734 SNPs for linkage mapping, resulting in 27 linkage groups with a minimum logarithm of odds (LOD) of 8 and maximum recombination fraction of 0.35. The final genetic map contains 7,192 successfully mapped markers that span a total of 2,811 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.39 cM. Comparative genomic analysis between tambaqui and zebrafish revealed variable levels of genomic conservation across the 27 linkage groups which allowed for functional SNP annotations. The large-scale SNP discovery obtained here, allowed us to build a high-density linkage map in tambaqui, which will be useful to enhance genetic studies that can be applied in breeding programs.

AB Changes in natural habitats and the community response to such changes have important impacts on the distribution of diversity. Theoretical advances have highlighted the importance of including dispersal traits to predict responses to habitat loss, but empirical evidence is lacking. We investigated the effect of metacommunity size (by manipulating the number of habitat patches) and isolation (by manipulating proximity to reefs) in structuring marine macro-faunal communities. The overall response of macrofauna to changes in habitat size and proximity to reefs varied according to the species' ability to disperse after settlement. Whilst the richness of species with sessile adult stages responded to proximity to reefs in which metacommunities were deployed, species with motile adult stages responded to metacommunity size. Results were similar at both the patch and metacommunity scales. A subsequent experiment showed that colonisation had an impact on the macrofaunal responses to reef proximity, which persisted throughout the community assembly process. The inclusion of simple functional traits (i.e. post-settlement dispersal) allows a better understanding of species responses to the spatial configuration of habitats at multiple ecological scales, which may be key for predicting the consequences of habitat loss.

AB Dam removal is an increasingly popular restoration tool, but our understanding of ecological responses to dam removal over time is still in the early stages. We quantified seasonal benthic macroinvertebrate density, taxonomic composition, and functional traits for three years after lowhead dam removal in three reaches of the Olentangy River (Ohio, USA): two upstream of former dam (one restored, one unrestored), and one downstream of former dam. Macroinvertebrate community density, generic richness, and Shannon-Wiener diversity decreased between similar to 9 and similar to 15 months after dam removal; all three variables consistently increased thereafter. These threshold responses were dependent on reach location: density and richness increased similar to 15 months after removal in upstream reaches versus similar to 19 months downstream of the former dam. Initial macroinvertebrate density declines were likely related to seasonality or life-history characteristics, but density increased up to 2.27 X from year to year in three out of four seasons (late autumn, early spring, summer) across all reaches. Macroinvertebrate community composition was similar among the three reaches, but differed seasonally based on non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM). Seasonal differences among communities tended to decrease after dam removal. We detected community-wide shifts in functional traits such as multivoltinism, depositional habitat use, burrowing, and collector-gatherer feeding mode. We observed that these traits were expressed most strongly with Chironomidae, which was the most abundant family. Our results suggest that seasonal environmental conditions can play a role in the response and recovery of macroinvertebrate communities-often used to monitor ecosystem condition- following dam removal. In particular, macroinvertebrate density and diversity can show recovery after dam removal, especially in seasons when macroinvertebrate density is typically lowest, with concomitant changes to functional trait abundance. Thus, we recommend scientists and managers consider responses to dam removal throughout the year. Further, similar density, generic richness, and functional traits among reaches suggest that channel restoration after dam removal may initially have equivocal effects on invertebrate communities.

AB Little research has focused on how rotifer communities respond to eutrophication based on their combined taxonomic and functional indices. In this research, the relationship of the environment and rotifer communities was comparatively investigated in two subtropical lakes over one year. The taxonbased indices, including species number (S), Margalef index (D), Simpson index (d), Shannon-wiener index (H'), and functional traits relying on the guild ratio (GR) and the modified guild ratio (GR') from the moderately eutrophic Lake Xiyanghu were significantly lower than those from the slightly eutrophic Lake Jinghu. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that both lakes were distinct from each other. Taken together, the findings indicate that trophic state was an important factor affecting rotifer community structure. In addition, the average annual GR' of Lake Xiyanghu was < 0, suggesting the dominancy of microphagous rotifers. Over time, S, D, d, and H' were positively correlated with temperature and phosphorus levels in Lake Jinghu, but were negatively correlated with NH4(+) -N levels in Lake Xiyanghu. Only GR' was negatively associated with chlorophyll-a in Lake Xiyanghu, implying that the functional index (GR') might be an effective tool to explore the relationship between trophic state and the rotifer community in seriously eutrophic lakes.

AB Sympatric speciation has been debated in evolutionary biology for decades. Although it has gained in acceptance recently, still only a handful of empirical examples are seen as valid (e.g. crater lake cichlids). In this study, we disentangle the role of hypertrophied lips in the repeated adaptive radiations of Nicaraguan crater lake cichlid fish. We assessed the role of disruptive selection and assortative mating during the early stages of divergence and found a functional trade-off in feeding behaviour between thick-and thin-lipped ecotypes, suggesting that this trait is a target of disruptive selection. Thick-lipped fish perform better on nonevasive prey at the cost of a poorer performance on evasive prey. Using enclosures in the wild, we found that thick-lipped fish perform significantly better in rocky than in sandy habitats. We found almost no mixed pairs during two breeding seasons and hence significant assortative mating. Genetic differentiation between ecotypes seems to be related to the time since colonization, being subtle in L. Masaya (1600 generations ago) and absent in the younger L. Apoyeque (< 600 generations ago). Genome-wide differentiation between ecotypes was higher in the old source lakes than in the young crater lakes. Our results suggest that hypertrophied lips might be promoting incipient sympatric speciation through divergent selection (ecological divergence in feeding performance) and nonrandom mating (assortative mating) in the young Nicaraguan crater lakes. Nonetheless, further manipulative experiments are needed in order to confirm the role of hypertrophied lips as the main cue for assortative mating.

AB Impacts of bottom fishing, particularly trawling and dredging, on seabed (benthic) habitats are commonly perceived to pose serious environmental risks. Quantitative ecological risk assessment can be used to evaluate actual risks and to help guide the choice of management measures needed to meet sustainability objectives. We develop and apply a quantitative method for assessing the risks to benthic habitats by towed bottom-fishing gears. The method is based on a simple equationfor relative benthic status (RBS), derived by solving the logistic population growth equationfor the equilibrium state. Estimating RBS requires only maps of fishing intensity and habitat type - and parameters for impact and recovery rates, which may be taken from meta-analyses of multiple experimental studies of towed-gear impacts. The aggregate status of habitats in an assessed region is indicated by the distribution of RBS values for the region. The application of RBS is illustrated for a tropical shrimp-trawl fishery. The status of trawled habitats and their RBS value depend on impact rate (depletion per trawl), recovery rate and exposure to trawling. In the shrimp-trawl fishery region, gravel habitat was most sensitive, and though less exposed than sand or muddy-sand, was most affected overall (regional RBS=91% relative to un-trawled RBS=100%). Muddy-sand was less sensitive, and though relatively most exposed, was less affected overall (RBS=95%). Sand was most heavily trawled but least sensitive and least affected overall (RBS=98%). Region-wide, >94% of habitat area had >80% RBS because most trawling and impacts were confined to small areas. RBS was also applied to the region's benthic invertebrate communities with similar results.Conclusions. Unlike qualitative or categorical trait-based risk assessments, the RBS method provides a quantitative estimate of status relative to an unimpacted baseline, with minimal requirements for input data. It could be applied to bottom-contact fisheries world-wide, including situations where detailed data on characteristics of seabed habitats, or the abundance of seabed fauna are not available. The approach supports assessment against sustainability criteria and evaluation of alternative management strategies (e.g. closed areas, effort management, gear modifications).

AB Dams are considered one of the most important threats to freshwater ecosystems. To date, assessments of the impact of riverine impoundments are based primarily on taxonomic approaches where little can be inferred about functional ecological change. We assessed the impact of damming in a cold region river fish community in Alberta, Canada, by integrating taxonomic and trait-based approaches over time (before, during the first 5 years, and after 5 years of dam construction), considering the longitudinal habitat and environmental change created by reservoir formation (downstream, reservoir, and upstream). Integrating both approaches was found to be informative, as alterations to taxonomic composition in fish communities provided initial clues to a functional response in a spatiotemporal context. Biomonitoring should therefore explicitly consider longitudinal spatial gradients in the design, implementation, and evaluation of management actions. Understanding the underlying environmental causes of why the combination of some traits are connected to the risk of species loss or a decline in their distribution is an important step towards the development of better conservation and mitigation strategies.

AB Anadromous fishes exhibit diverse life history and functional traits. Spawning anadromous fishes bring nutrients to fresh waters, and their life history and functional traits can influence nutrient loading patterns. We asked how nutrient inputs varied across 12 species of North American anadromous fishes and how these patterns affected river-wide trends in nutrient loading. We used portfolio effect analyses to assess whether diversity stabilized or destabilized nutrient inputs to freshwater ecosystems over time. Recent decreases in body size reduced per individual nutrient loading for several key species, which in turn decreased cumulative loading. Invasion also altered nutrient loading; non-native American shad (Alosa sapidissima) now provide nearly half of the annual marine-derived nutrient inputs to the Columbia River. Counter to expectations, species diversity (richness and evenness) did not significantly increase the stability of nutrient inputs to fresh waters. Species loss in the Connecticut River increased stability, while species gain in the Columbia River decreased stability.

Metrics from both approaches showed similar trends in the variation of communities along the gradients, in which higher ecological health was found in less disturbed sites (farthest from the disturbance source), with the converse at more stressful sites (close to the disturbance source). The functional-based approach, using biological traits analysis and functional diversity indices, showed potential to be included in monitoring programmes at rocky shores alongside taxonomic-based metrics.

AB The development of biomonitoring tools is increasingly appealing in light of the increasing degradation of aquatic ecosystems. In this context, we investigated the responses of stream fish communities to the gradient of environmental degradation in different basins using a variety of indices based on functional diversity, functional composition, and taxonomic diversity. We used datasets from three Brazilian ecoregions. In order to describe the gradient of environmental degradation we scored streams based on local and landscape variables. The functional structure of the assemblages was described in relation to seven functional traits related to habitat use, swimming capacity, and maneuverability. We described assemblages in each ecoregion separately in relation to 20 potential indicators, grouped in four families: indices of functional diversity based on presence/absence (FDp/a); indices of functional diversity weighted by abundance (FDabund); indices of functional composition (mT); and, indices based on taxonomic diversity (TDiv). The relationship between the indicators and the gradient of environmental degradation were evaluated using linear regression. We found a significant interaction effect (ANOVA, p = 0.006) between group of indices and ecoregions for the performance of indicators, suggesting a context -dependent response. The indices, on an individual basis, had variable performance and consistency among ecoregions. Four mT indicators demonstrated the highest average performance and consistency. Taxonomic diversity indicators consistently had the lowest average performance, while FDp/a and FDabund indicators had low average performance and variable inter-regional consistency. The differential inter-regional performance of indicators was due to the differences in the lengths of the gradients of environmental degradation. Our results indicate that functional traits have greater predictive power compared to taxonomic indicators for fish responses to a gradient of environmental degradation. Although indicators of functional composition are the most promising, we emphasize that caution is needed when generalizing functional diversity indicators across ecoregions because most of them are context-dependent.

AB Land use is known to alter the nature of land-water interactions, but the potential effects of widespread forest management on headwaters in boreal regions remain poorly understood. We evaluated the importance of catchment land use, land cover, and local stream variables for macroinvertebrate community and functional trait diversity in 18 boreal headwater streams. Variation in macroinvertebrate metrics was often best explained by in-stream variables, primarily water chemistry (e.g. pH). However, variation in stream variables was, in turn, significantly associated with catchment-scale forestry land use. More specifically, streams running through catchments that were dominated by young (11-50 years) forests had higher pH, greater organic matter standing stock, higher abundance of aquatic moss, and the highest macroinvertebrate diversity, compared to streams running through recently clear-cut and old forests. This indicates that catchment-scale forest management can modify in-stream habitat conditions with effects on stream macroinvertebrate communities and that characteristics of younger forests may promote conditions that benefit headwater biodiversity.

AB 1. The relationship between community structure and the functioning of ecosystems is the subject of ongoing debate. Biological or functional trait-based approaches that capture life strategy, morphology and behavioural characteristics have received far less attention than taxonomic diversity in this context, despite their more intuitive link to ecosystem functioning.
   2. Macrophyte primary production underpins aquatic food webs, regulates benthic and pelagic ecosystems and is a key aspect of the global carbon cycle. This study spans a range of aquatic biomes across Europe and aims to examine potential for predicting primary production of macrophyte communities based on the functional traits of species and identify the traits that are the most informative indicators of macrophyte production.
   3. Macrophyte primary production was assessed based on the oxygen production of the whole community, linked to biomasses of selected biological traits derived of its component species and analysed using the novel boosted regression trees modelling technique.
   4. Results showed that functional traits derived from macrophyte community data explained most of the variation in primary production of macrophyte communities without the need to incorporate environmental data on the habitats. Macrophyte primary production was influenced by a combination of tolerance, morphology and life habit traits; however tolerance traits contributed most of variability in macrophyte primary production when all traits were analysed jointly.
   5. This study also showed the existence of trait clustering as the studied trait categories were not fully independent; strong interlinkages between and within trait categories emerged.
   6. Our study suggests that functional trait analysis captures different aspects of ecosystem functioning and thereby enables assessing primary production of macrophyte communities over geographically distinct areas without extensive taxonomic and environmental data. This could result in a novel framework through which a simplification of the general procedure of production estimations and comparisons across environmental gradients can be achieved.

AB Chemical micropollutants occur worldwide in the environment at low concentrations and in complex mixtures, and how they affect the ecology of natural systems is still uncertain. Dynamics of natural communities are driven by the interaction between individual organisms and their growth environment, which is mediated by the organisms' expressed phenotypic traits. We tested whether exposure to a mixture of 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) influences phenotypic trait diversity in lake phytoplankton communities and their ability to regulate biomass production to fit environmental changes (response capacity). We exposed natural phytoplankton assemblages to three mixture levels in permeable microcosms maintained at three depths in a eutrophic lake for one week, during which the environmental conditions were fluctuating. We studied individual-level traits, phenotypic diversity and community biomass. PPCP reduced individual-level trait variance and overall community phenotypic diversity, but maintained higher standing phytoplankton biomass compared to untreated controls. Estimated effect sizes of PPCP on traits and community properties were very large (partial Eta-squared > 0.15). The PPCP mixture antagonistically interacted with the natural environmental gradient in habitats offered by different depths and, at concentrations comparable to those in waste-water effluents, prevented communities from converging to the same phenotypic structure and total biomass of unexposed controls. We show that micropollutants can alter individual-level trait diversity of lake phytoplankton communities and therefore their capacity to respond to natural environmental gradients, potentially affecting aquatic ecosystem processes.

AB The life history strategies of fishes can be defined by specific combinations of demographic traits that influence species performances depending on environmental features. Hence, the constraints imposed by the local conditions restrict the range of successful strategies by excluding species poorly adapted. In the present study, we compared the demographic strategies of fish caught in 47 estuaries of the North East Atlantic coast, aiming to determine the specific attributes of resident species and test for changes in trait associations along the environmental gradients. Eight demographic traits were considered to project our findings within a conceptual triangular model, composed on three endpoint strategies: (i) periodic (large size, long generation time, high fecundity); (ii) opportunistic (small size, short generation time, high reproductive effort); and (iii) equilibrium (low fecundity, large egg size, parental care). We demonstrated that various life history strategies co-exist in estuaries, but equilibrium species were scarce and restricted to euhaline open-water. Resident species form a specialised assemblage adapted to high spatiotemporal variability of estuarine conditions, i.e. opportunistic attributes associated with parental care. Even with these singular attributes, our findings revealed changes in distribution of resident species across the estuarine gradients linked to their life history traits. Among other patterns, the diversity of life history strategies significantly decreased from euhaline to oligohaline areas and along gradient of human disturbances. These trends were associated with a convergence of species traits toward short generation times, suggesting that long-lived species with late maturation are more severely impacted by disturbance and environmental stress.

AB The main goal of this paper is to describe three new species of the genus Monospilus Sars, 1862 (Crustacea: Cladocera). Monospilus macroerosus sp. nov. differs from other species of the genus in several peculiar morphological traits, the most striking being the presence of a saw-shaped pecten of teeth on the postabdominal claw. This species inhabits semiterrestrial habitats (wet leaf litter on hydromorphic soil from gallery forest), exhibiting adaptations related to movement and food handling in this type of habitat. Monospilus brachyspinus sp. nov. inhabits truly aquatic habitats, where lives being associated with macrophytes and submerged leaves. It may be recognized by the postabdominal claw, which is armed with proximal spinulae modified in a short spine. In Monospilus sp., the proximal spinulae are modified in a long and slender spine. So far, Monospilus sp. occurs in southern South America, while Monospilus macroerosus sp. nov. and Monospilus brachyspinus sp. nov. occur in the Cerrado biome in Brazil, in the central portion of South America. Some conclusions about the conservation status of new species also are made.

AB Currently, there is limited knowledge on how benthic communities function in relation to changing environmental conditions in tropical estuaries. This study contributes to filling this knowledge gap by analysing structural and functional community patterns within two tropical estuaries in the northeast of Brazil. Replicate macrofaunal samples were taken in different environmental zones along the estuary, together with physico-chemical measurements. The faunal analysis focussed on the trait analysis of polychaete and mollusc communities as both of these groups have an important role in regulating the functioning of aquatic systems. The separate analyses of polychaetes and molluscs allowed evaluating the way in which each group responded to the environmental gradients. The results demonstrate that community functioning for the polychaetes depended greatly on the spatial environmental gradients within these systems-, with generally higher functional diversity in the lower zones suggesting increased diversity in resource use strategies, whereas the upper zones showed very little functional diversity due to the prevalence of environmental filtering. In the case of the molluscs, their functioning remained more similar along the estuarine gradient, with low taxonomic and functional diversity throughout the estuaries. In general, polychaetes displayed higher levels of taxonomic and functional diversity, suggesting that compared to the molluscs, they potentially utilised the available resources more efficiently, which may enhance the processes and overall functioning of these systems. We advocate that more studies are needed to obtain a generalised pattern of estuarine function within and across biogeographical regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chironomidae are diverse and present a wide variety of ecological preferences. Thus, they have high potential in establishing reference conditions for river bioassessment and in providing functional information, especially when other macroinvertebrates are poorly represented. However, because of taxonomic difficulties and poor knowledge of traits, they are neglected in bioassessment programmes and kept at coarser taxonomic levels, reducing the discrimination power of invertebrate-based diagnostic tools. Here, we compared the efficiency of Chironomidae at the subfamily and genus levels and their biological traits (Eltonian and morphological) in the distinction between permanent (medium altitude and lowland) and temporary Mediterranean streams. We established a priori predictions on the expected Chironomidae trait categories in each stream type, conferring the best adaptations to particular environmental constraints. Genus composition (not subfamily) and respective trait categories differed among the three stream types. Both biological traits identified differences between stream types. Among Eltonian traits, diapause stages segregated permanent medium altitude from lowland and temporary stream assemblages, reflecting adaptations to temperature and flow regime variations. Substrate relation and size distinguished temporary from permanent stream assemblages, interpreted as an adaptation to unstable sediments and irregular flow regimes. Morphological traits associated with mobility and foraging (e.g., body setae, Lauterborn sensory organs) discriminated temporary from permanent stream assemblages, reflecting differences in temporal and spatial stream heterogeneity. The use of these morphological characteristics relying on the observation of few characteristics, offers an alternative to the use of Chironomidae Eltonian traits in bioassessment and ecological studies, without a need for high taxonomic expertise.

AB Dams are important to human wellbeing; however, they can cause various environmental changes. In the cerrado stricto sensu, waters from the reservoir modify water supply in the soil and can affect species establishment. It is argued that species adapted to high water availability can establish close to river banks and water reservoirs and their characteristics are different from those of species from the cerrado stricto sensu. These characteristics could be more similar to those of species from riparian forests, with higher values of height and basal area. Thus, we aim to analyze changes in an area of the cerrado stricto sensu, 35 years after the construction of a hydroelectric dam. We tested different parameters to determine these changes, including richness, diversity, individual height and basal area (using the square-point method), with individuals <1 m, individuals >1 m, and Bromeliaceae (using the plot method) in three sectors close to the artificial lakeshore (0 m - 20 m, 40 m - 60 m, and 80 m - 100 m away from the water). Using species diversity, we also compared the species functional group within these sectors. Sectors closer to the dam acted as an edge, presenting lower basal area and individual's height, but species with different traits compared to those of a cerrado stricto sensu area.

AB Trait-based approaches to vegetation analyses are becoming more prevalent in studies of riparian vegetation dynamics, including responses to flow regulation, groundwater pumping, and climate change. These analyses require species trait data compiled from the literature and floras or original field measurements. Gathering such data makes trait-based research time intensive at best and impracticable in some cases. To support trait-based analysis of vegetation along the Colorado River through Grand Canyon, a data set of 20 biological traits and ecological affinities for 179 species occurring in that study area was compiled. This diverse flora shares species with many riparian areas in the western USA and includes species that occur across a wide moisture gradient. Data were compiled from published scientific papers, unpublished reports, plant fact sheets, existing trait databases, regional floras, and plant guides. Data for ordinal environmental tolerances were more readily available than were quantitative traits. More publicly available data are needed for traits of both common and rare southwestern U.S. plant species to facilitate comprehensive, trait-based research.

AB Exotic invasive species are one of the major threats for aquatic ecosystems. However, the interactions between exotic plants and exotic herbivores have been little studied, despite their role in invasion success. Here, we tested how interactions between an invasive plant and an invasive herbivore could affect their own growth and their colonization abilities in freshwater ecosystems. Ludwigia grandiflora and Procambarus clarkii, two exotic invasive species which co-occur in some French wetlands, were used for our laboratory experiment and field survey. Although L grandiflora was consumed by crayfish, its growth was not significantly affected by crayfish density. Indeed, the final living biomass of L. grandiflora was similar to those of controls, despite significant losses induced by crayfish. Furthermore, L. grandiflora became more fragmented in the presence of a high density of P. clarkii, which might increase its dispersal abilities. In addition, our field survey revealed that the abundance of crayfish was higher in a patch invaded by L. grandiflora than in an uninvaded patch. Thus, the outcome of the interaction between the invasive plant and the invasive crayfish, via its positive effect on the invasion dynamics of these two species, could have dramatic consequences for native communities of freshwater ecosystems.
