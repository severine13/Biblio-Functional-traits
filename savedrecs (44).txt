AB Floodplains are species-rich environments often strongly impacted by human activities. In particular, the negative effects of progressive and rapid disconnection of secondary channels have led to restoration programmes and a growing interest in restoration ecology.
   Current restoration strategies in large river floodplains focus on the macroinvertebrate response related to the increases in lateral connectivity of the secondary channels. We constructed a framework to assess a gradient of hydrological connectivity among 13 secondary channels and the main channel of a large river, and we modelled the response of a set of macroinvertebrate metrics to this gradient. Comparisons between predicted and observed metrics in restored channels allowed us to measure the effect of an increase in the hydrological connectivity on the biological characteristics of macroinvertebrate assemblages.
   The pre-restoration framework enabled a clear ordering of channels into three types according to levels of hydrological connectivity. Rarefied richness and species traits, responding to the connectivity gradient, showed a net difference between disconnected channels and the main river channel. We were able to highlight a predation-colonization trade-off along the gradient of hydrological connectivity with a maximum colonization potential in the most connected channels.
   Post-restoration sampling showed deviations of the restored channels from their expected ecological state. A large proportion of colonizers were favoured by the restoration operations and non-native species occurred in the restored channels.
   Synthesis and applications. Macroinvertebrate biodiversity in large river floodplains is shaped by lateral hydrological connectivity. Increasing hydrological connectivity led to an increase in colonization rate. One year after restoration, the increase in lateral connectivity had shifted the restored sites away from the predicted state. This unpredictability is, in part, a consequence of the rapid colonization by non-native species of new habitats created by the restoration measures. We recommend that floodplain-scale restoration should focus on diversification of the hydrological connectivity of channels, thereby conserving a maximum of functional characteristics in macroinvertebrate communities.

AB This study explores the relationship between morphology and diet in four Andean killifishes (Orestias) from Lake Titicaca that are known to differ in habitat use. Species that fed preferentially on amphipods (Orestias albus) or molluscs (Orestias luteus) separated in multivariate space from other species that feed on cladocera and algae (Orestias agassii and Orestias jussiei). Generally, specimens feeding on cladocera were characterized by a short, blunt nose with a small mouth; whereas, specimens feeding on amphipods exhibited a long snout with a large mouth. Specimens including molluscs in their diet tended to have a larger posterior part of the head and the larger opercles than others; while the occurrence of substratum in gut content was generally related to a short but deep head. The present analysis suggests that the littoral O. jussiei has an intermediate phenotype and diet between the pelagic (O. agassii) and benthic (O. albus and O. luteus) species. Results suggest that resource partitioning was occurring and that several morphological traits relate to characteristics of the diet, and it is inferred that the benthic, the pelagic and the littoral zones in the lake host different prey communities constituting distinct adaptive landscapes.

AB The macroinvertebrate fauna of twenty-one ponds (thirteen temporary and eight permanent) located in four protected areas in Central Italy were studied in March, May and June 2002, with the aim to bring out relationships between environmental variables and the functional characteristics (functional feeding groups, habits and resistance to drought) of communities. Macroinvertebrates were collected in three mesohabitat types (macrophyte beds, littoral sediments, central sediments). Overall, the functional attributes of temporary and permanent pond communities did not differ greatly. However, at the mesohabitat scale, collector-gatherers, burrowers and permanent residents capable of passive dispersal were more abundant in sediments. Scrapers and shredders, sprawlers and climbers, swimmers and divers, and organisms capable of active dispersal which lack drought resistance were more abundant in macrophyte beds. Although hydroperiod is the main driving factor affecting community structure, our results suggest that it remains an unimportant factor in controlling functional traits, which appeared to be more influenced by substratum types. Moreover, the positive relationship between taxonomic and functional diversity metrics indicates that an increase in taxonomic richness induces a satisfactory partitioning of the ecological resources among taxa, thus maintaining the ecological complexity of the ponds regardless of their hydroperiod length.

AB Livestock grazing represents a major human disturbance to grasslands throughout the world. We evaluated the effects of long-term grazing (> 20 years) on a dominant perennial grass species, Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel., in the semiarid grassland of Inner Mongolia, China, in terms of its morphological and functional responses. L. chinensis, one of the most abundant species in semiarid grassland, had significantly smaller leaf area, fewer vegetative tillers and shorter shoot internodes length, but significantly greater specific leaf area for the individuals in the grazing plot than those in the exclosure (grazing-free) plot. Long-term grazing also altered the relative distribution of biomass to leaves, roots and rhizomes. The biomass, coverage and the number of species were lower in the grazing plot by 50-70% in comparison with those in the grazing-free plot. In addition, the long-term grazing substantively decreased the physiological capacities of this grass species, including significantly lower net photosynthetic rate, apparent quantum efficiency, photochemical efficiency of PSII and water use efficiency. Significantly higher stable oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) of the soil water in the grazing plot than those in the grazing-free plot indicated a much higher soil evaporation in the grazing plot because of less litter coverage. Seasonal patterns in the delta O-18 values of the stem water of L. chinensis and three other common species in the grazing and grazing-free plots indicated that plants in the grazing and grazing-free plots might shift their water sources differently from a dry month (June) to a wet month (August). This study illustrated the importance of using different approaches to study the possible responses of grass species in arid regions to human disturbances, such as long-term grazing.

AB The taxonomic and functional structure of oligochaete and chironomid communities ill a stony-bottomed river reach was investigated with respect 10 Substrate and hydraulic conditions. Combined oligochaete and chironomid data were analyzed to search for main gradients and the separate data sets were analyzed to identify the most important variables determining the Structure of the Communities. Preferences for particular hydraulic conditions, expressed as Froude number, were calculated for 29 most abundant taxa. The results of Correspondence Analysis (CA) indicated that the main gradient in the data could be explained by hydraulic conditions and, inversely, by the amount of sedimented particulate organic matter (POM). The second CA axis probably reflected the quantity of the available food and space resources. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed the amount of sedimented POM as the most important variable explaining 21 and 24% of the variance in the oligochaete and chironomid data, respectively. Among the other variables, the Occurrence of aquatic vegetation, variability of near-bottom current velocity and substrate roughness were the most important. In the case ofchironornids, the proportions of functional feeding strategies changed along the gradient of hydraulic conditions: the proportions of predators, active filter-feeders and collectors/gatherers decreased with the increasing hydraulic stress, while the proportion of grazers/scrapers increased. Nevertheless, in the case of oligochaetes, the proportions of functional feeding strategies did not follow the gradient of hydraulic Conditions. Although the total abundance of both oligochaetes and chironomids was independent of hydraulic conditions, only few oligochaete taxa were able to succeed in hydraulically rough conditions and most oligochaete taxa were found only in pools. On the other hand, chironomids showed high taxa richness, which seemed to be limited by the quantity of the available food and space resources rather than hydraulic stress.

AB Channelization is the creation of man-made structures that resect, realign, or endose aquatic systems in order to prevent flooding or to modify their flows for various land uses. The present study examined the impact of this human pressure on the spatial and temporal dynamics of small streams. The physical and floristic characteristies of seventeen reaches in four French rivers were surveyed six times over the course of two years. Macropyte communities were divided into three biological groups vascular plants, macroalgae and bryophytes. We used plant functional traits to understand the effects of channelization on community structure. Our results suggest that channelization affected the spatio-temporal dynamic of physical and floristic composition. Channelized reaches were shallower and narrower than non-channelized reaches. i.e. control reaches. They also exhibited different substrate types and dominant species. Difference were mainly observed at the macrohabitat scale, i.e. the pool/triffle scale, within the selected reaches. Alteration in spatio-temporal dynamics of physical and plant composition coul be linked to species biological traits. Vascular plants and macroalgae in channelized reaches used a variety of adaptive strategies (e.g. small versus tall size) which allowed them to persist depite environmental differences, whereas plants in control reaches showed a combination of intermediate strategies. Bryophytes were mainly found in control reaches with the exception of Fontinalis antipyretica. These findings could serve as guidelines for future channelization projects and for conservation measures to preserve the dynamics of natural streams.

AB The aim of the present Study was to describe the relationships between macroinvertebrate traits and lateral hydrological and environmental gradients in a Mediterranean river-floodplain, from the main river channel to three disconnected floodplain wetlands. Bimonthly water and macroinvertebrate samples were collected from ail array of riverine wetlands in the Ebro River in northeast Spain. Our analysis of trait structures in wetlands aligned along a lateral hydrological gradient showed that community composition changed from a rich and abundant invertebrate community dominated by generalist species adapted to disturbance at the river site to a more trait-diversified community of specialist species adapted to stability and biotic interaction in hydrologically disconnected floodplain sites. The diversity Of functional groups peaked at intermediate-connected sites, where both generalist and specialist species coexist. The highest richness of functional groups was found in the river site, reflecting its highest habitat heterogeneity. The main environmental variables shaping the structure of invertebrate traits extracted after Redundancy Analysis were flood duration and frequency (surrogates of hydrological disturbance), dissolved solids (surrogate of confinement) and nitrate concentration (surrogate of agricultural pressure). These environmental variables explained 43 % of the existing variability in invertebrate traits. Because groups with similar traits responded in different ways to the main gradients, we conclude that the functional grouping of invertebrates provides ail adequate and simple tool to assess changes in functionality and the effect of lateral gradients across a floodplain. Our results highlight the need to integrate the Study of rivers and their floodplains to better account for their close interaction.

AB Water Framework Directive (WFD) fostered research interest on bioassessment tools to evaluate the ecological integrity of surface waters. The application of WFD implies the reliability enhancement of existing bioassessment tools to larger geographic areas for a better convergence across European Union (UE) state members as well as the maintenance or enhancement of ecological functions of water bodies. Among the several available biological indicators, those elaborated using stream invertebrate communities are common for monitoring river ecological integrity in EU member states. The performance of four different approaches (biotic indices, multimetrics, multivariate, and based on biological traits of taxa) are represented. Apparent contradictions between scientific development and associated creativity and complexity, on one hand, and the necessity for summarising ecological integrity by a single score as required by most decision-makers, on another hand, have implied that none of the currently, developed methology is ideal. However, trends is some approaches help the identification of elements needed to the elaboration of a reliable biomonitoring tool. Such tool should (i) be operational on both local and regional scales, (ii) rely on prediction and reference conditions, and (iii) address both the occurrence of taxa and measures of ecological functions (e.g., biological traits).

AB Understanding how species loss influences ecosystem function is a contemporary issue in ecology. However, most research has focused on species loss at one trophic-level. We explored the relationship between functional diversity (FD) and species richness separately for trees and aquatic leaf-shredding detritivores. For trees, we collected information on species-specific leaf tissue chemistry and species co-occurrences in the mid-Atlantic region (USA). For shredders, we used a published trait database with information on communities from 38 streams in the same region. We used a clustering algorithm to estimate FD for each community and for randomly assembled communities. If FD was high, we concluded that species loss was important to change in function; if low, species were functionally redundant and insensitive to species loss. We found tree FD to be significantly different than expected, but shredders exhibited FD levels similar to patterns based on random assembly. Furthermore, there were more leaf species exclusively associated with very high or very low levels of functional diversity compared to shredders. This approach revealed greater implications for leaf than shredder species loss for litter breakdown.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the relative importance of flooding- and confinement-related environmental features in explaining macroinvertebrate trait structure and diversity in a pool of wetlands located in a Mediterranean river floodplain. To test hypothesized trait-environment relationships, we employed a recently implemented statistical procedure, the fourth-corner method. We found that flooding-related variables, mainly pH and turbidity, were related to it-ails that confer an ability of the organism to resist flooding (e.g., small body-shape, protection of eggs) or recuperate faster after flooding (e.g., short life-span, asexual reproduction). In contrast, confinement-related variables, mainly temperature and organic matter, enhanced traits that allow organisms to interact and compete with other organisms (e.g., large size, sexual reproduction) and to efficiently use habitat and resources (e.g., diverse locomotion and feeding strategies). These results are in agreement with predictions made under the River Habitat Templet for lotic ecosystems, and demonstrate the ability of the fourth-corner method to test hypothesis that posit trait-environment relationships. Trait diversity was slightly higher in flooded than in confined sites, whereas trait richness was not significantly different. This suggests that although trail structure may change it? response to the main environnmental factors, as evidenced by the fourth-corner method, the number of life-history strategies needed to persist in the face of such constraints remains more or less constant; only their relative dominance differs.

AB Legionella pneumophila is the etiological agent of Legionnaires' disease and of the less acute disease Pontiac fever. It is a Gram-negative bacterium present in fresh and artificial water environments that replicates in protozoan hosts and is also found in biofilms. Replication within protozoa is essential for the survival of the bacterium. The last years have seen a giant step forward in the genomics of L. pneumophila. The establishment and publication of the complete genome sequences of three clinical L. pneumophila isolates in 2004 and a fourth in 2007 has paved the way for major breakthroughs in understanding the biology of L. pneumophila in particular and Legionella in general. Sequence analysis identified several specific features of Legionella: (i) an extraordinary genetic diversity among the different isolates and (ii) the presence of an unexpected high number and variety of eukaryotic-like proteins, predicted to be involved in the exploitation of the host cellular processes by mimicking specific eukaryotic functions. In this chapter, we will first discuss the insights gained from genomics by highlighting the characteristic features and common traits of the four L. pneumophila genomes obtained through genome analysis and comparison and then we will focus on the newest results obtained by functional analysis of different eukaryotic-like proteins and describe their involvement in the pathogenicity of L. pneumophila.

AB Ecosystems around the world are experiencing unprecedented rates of extinction and species decline. The question of how community disassembly-the ongoing process of nonrandom species losses and declines-affects ecosystem functions, including those that influence persistence of other species, is addressed. The order in which species disappear from a community depends on their vulnerability to specific stressors and on traits associated with inherent susceptibility to decline. Information on species characteristics associated with vulnerability (response traits) is synthesized, and it is asked whether they are associated with characteristics that underpin significant contributions to ecosystem functioning (effect traits). Direct evidence that community disassembly affects ecosystem functioning comes from a variety of sources, ranging from documentation of long-term changes following the loss of an initial species or fragmentation of a landscape, to modeling and manipulative experiments that simulate species losses and observe their consequences. The usefulness to conservation and restoration practice of community disassembly as a concept is evaluated, and it is asked whether and how community disassembly can provide guidance about species loss order, its consequences, what each of these depends on, and whether a positive link exists between vulnerability and contribution to function-a link that would exacerbate the consequences of the ongoing extinction crisis.

AB The plastic alterations of clonal architecture are likely to have functional consequences, as they affect the spatial distribution of ramets over patchy environments. However, little is known about the effect of mechanical stresses on the clonal growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clonal plasticity induced by mechanical stress consisting of continuous water current encountered by aquatic plants. More particularly, the aim was to test the capacity of the plants to escape this stress through clonal plastic responses.
   The transplantation of ramets of the same clone in two contrasting flow velocity conditions was carried out for two species (Potamogeton coloratus and Mentha aquatica) which have contrasting clonal growth forms. Relative allocation to clonal growth, to creeping stems in the clonal biomass, number and total length of creeping stems, spacer length and main creeping stem direction were measured.
   For P. coloratus, plants exposed to water current displayed increased total length of creeping stems, increased relative allocation to creeping stems within the clonal dry mass and increased spacer length. For M. aquatica, plants exposed to current displayed increased number and total length of creeping stems. Exposure to current induced for both species a significant increase of the proportion of creeping stems in the downstream direction to the detriment of creeping stems perpendicular to flow.
   This study demonstrates that mechanical stress from current flow induced plastic variation in clonal traits for both species. The responses of P. coloratus could lead to an escape strategy, with low benefits with respect to sheltering and anchorage. The responses of M. aquatica that may result in a denser canopy and enhancement of anchorage efficiency could lead to a resistance strategy.

AB 1. Unpredictable, extreme climatic events (e.g. droughts) can potentially destabilize aquatic communities. From 1998 to 2002, southwestern Georgia, U.S.A., experienced the third worst drought of the last 100 years, leading to loss of surface flow in many small streams. We sampled macroinvertebrates, flow and water chemistry in small headwater streams from 2001 to 2007 in two adjacent coastal plain streams of contrasting headwater type (wetland and groundwater-fed seep) following resumption of flow.
   2. Decreasing water temperature, conductivity and nutrient concentrations within the first 2 years of the study indicated flushing of the streambed associated with increased discharge. Invertebrate community composition became less variable over time and during wetter years, reflecting water chemistry, hydrological and climate conditions.
   3. A core set of species appeared immediately following breaking of the drought in both streams, reflecting a shared species pool. These species exhibited resilience traits, including short life cycles and resistance to desiccation, which allowed for rapid recovery from disturbance. Such species, which were small-bodied, sclerotized and abundant in the drift, were then replaced as flows increased by those that were larger, soft-bodied and rare in drift, suggesting a more stable and less ephemeral habitat.
   4. Hydrologic regime and long-term precipitation indices were strongly correlated with invertebrate community and trait structure. Long-term data allowed for better interpretation of the effects of infrequent disturbances on aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, long-term precipitation indices (i.e. 48-month standardized precipitation index) can indicate the likelihood of a return to drought, allowing for the collection of pre-disturbance data.

AB Inferences drawn from regional bioassessments could be strengthened by integrating data from different monitoring programs. We combined data from the US Geological Survey National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program and the US Environmental Protection Agency Wadeable Streams Assessment (WSA) to expand the scope of an existing River InVertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS)-type predictive model and to assess the biological condition of streams across the western US in a variety of landuse classes. We used model-derived estimates of taxon-specific probabilities of capture and observed taxon occurrences to identify taxa that were absent from sites where they were predicted to occur (decreasers) and taxa that were present at sites where they were not predicted to occur (increasers). Integration of 87 NAWQA reference sites increased the scope of the existing WSA predictive model to include larger streams and later season sampling. Biological condition at 336 NAWQA test sites was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with basin land use and tended to be lower in basins with intensive landuse modification (e.g., mixed, urban, and agricultural basins) than in basins with relatively undisturbed land use (e.g., forested basins). Of the 437 taxa observed among reference and test sites, 180 (41%) were increasers or decreasers. In general, decreasers had a different set of ecological traits (functional traits or tolerance values) than did increasers. We could predict whether a taxon was a decreaser or an increaser based on just a few traits, e.g., desiccation resistance, timing of larval development, habit, and thermal preference, but we were unable to predict the type of basin land use from trait states present in invertebrate assemblages. Refined characterization of traits might be required before bioassessment data call be used routinely to aid in the diagnoses of the causes of biological impairment.

AB The predictive power of the current risk-assessment framework for pesticides remains uncertain. This is because any extrapolation towards landscape-level effects encounters considerable uncertainties: (i) when proceeding from the level of individual single-species tests to populations and communities, biological interactions are not considered; (ii) from mesocosms to field communities, environmental factors and stressors that determine the effects of pesticides in the field are not considered; and (iii) most monitoring investigations are restricted spatially and do not consider recolonisation, and lack an adequate means of distinguishing confounding factors from natural variation. We advocate using species traits as community descriptors, to determine quantitative links between pesticide toxicity and community alterations. Recently, a trait-based indicator system was developed to identify SPEcies At Risk (SPEAR) of being affected by pesticides, with reference to life-history and physiological traits. This SPEAR system has now been successfully employed to link pesticide exposure and effects in Finland, France and Germany. The effect of pesticides on the structure of communities described with SPEAR was independent of the biogeographical region. We then extrapolated and visualised the anticipated risk for aquatic communities in small agricultural streams within Europe in a risk map. With this information we identified a potential risk from pesticide runoff in a high proportion of streams. By focusing on the ecological effect of selected environmental factors, trait-based approaches offer an increased realism for risk assessment of toxicants on the ecosystem level.

AB A number of indices designed to assess ecosystem function were applied to an existing benthic macrofaunal dataset collected following recent marine aggregate extraction activity at the Hastings Shingle Bank (UK). The objective of the study was to assess the use of these different functional metrics, some incorporating to investigate the rate of recovery in ecosystem function after dredging impact. All biological traits analysis, of the indices tested behaved in a broadly similar fashion following the aggregate extraction event, although some suggested faster rates of functional recovery than others. All indicated that the disturbed area of seabed was capable of full recovery given enough time. It is considered that this outcome may be because the physical nature of the seabed was unlikely to have been permanently altered by dredging for aggregate by the method used. This is not always the case following aggregate extraction and depends on the dredging protocol used (e.g., sediment screening). The indices tested (some applied for the first time to benthic macrofaunal data) were considered to be complementary to traditional environmental assessment metrics and each might be used under different circumstances.

AB A tongue-bite apparatus (TBA) governs raking behaviors in two major and unrelated teleost lineages, the osteoglossomorph and salmoniform fishes. We present data on comparative morphology and kinematics from two representative species, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the Australian arowana (Scleropages jardinii), which suggest that both the TBA and raking are convergently derived in these lineages. Similar TBA morphologies were present, except for differences in TBA dentition and shape of the novel cleithrobranchial ligament (CBL), which is arc-shaped in O. mykiss and straight in S. jardinii. Eight kinematic variables were used to quantify motion magnitude and maximum-timing in the kinematic input mechanisms of the TBA. Five variables differed inter-specifically (pectoral girdle retraction magnitude and timing, cranial and hyoid elevation and gape-distance timing), yet an incomplete taxon separation across multivariate kinematic space demonstrated an overall similarity in raking behavior. An outgroup analysis using bowfin (Amia calva) and pickerel (Esox americanus) to compare kinematics of raking with chewing and prey-capture provided robust quantitative evidence of raking being a convergently derived behavior. Support was also found for the notion that raking more likely evolved from the strike, a functionally distinct behavior, than from chewing, an alternative prey-processing behavior. Based on raking kinematic and muscle-activity data, we propose biomechanical models of the three input mechanisms that govern kinematics of the basihyal output mechanism during the raking power stroke: (1) cranial elevation protracts the upper TBA jaw from the lower (basihyal) TBA jaw; (2) basihyal retraction is caused directly by contraction of the sternohyoideus (SH); (3) hypaxial shortening, relayed via the pectoral girdle and SH-CBL complex, is an indirect basihyal retraction mechanism modeled as a four-bar linkage. These models will aid future analyses mapping structural and functional traits to the evolution of behaviors.

AB Living rodents show great diversity in their locomotor habits, including semiaquatic, arboreal, fossorial, ricochetal, and gliding species from multiple families. To assess the association between limb morphology and locomotor habits, the appendicular skeletons tons of 65 rodent genera from 16 families were measured. Ecomorphological analyses of various locomotor types revealed consistent differences in postcranial skeletal morphology that relate to functionally important traits. Behaviorally similar taxa showed convergent morphological characters, despite distinct evolutionary histories. Semiaquatic rodents displayed relatively robust bones, enlarged muscular attachments, short femora, and elongate hind feet. Arboreal rodents had relatively elongate humeri and digits, short olecranon processes of the ulnae, and equally proportioned fore and hind limbs. Fossorial rodents showed relatively robust bones, enlarged muscular attachments, short antebrachii and digits, elongate manual claws, and reduced hind limb elements. Ricochetal rodents displayed relatively proximal insertion of muscles, disproportionate limbs, elongate tibiae, and elongate hind feet. Gliding rodents had relatively elongate and gracile bones, short olecranon processes of the ulnae and equally proportioned fore and hind limbs. The morphological differences observed here can readily be used to discriminate extant rodents with different locomotor strategies. This suggests that the method could be applied to extinct rodents, regardless of ancestry, to accurately infer their locomotor ecologies. When applied to an extinct group of rodents, we found two distinct ecomorphs represented in the beaver family (Castoridae), semiaquatic and semifossorial. There was also a progressive trend toward increased body size and increased aquatic specialization in the giant beaver lineage (Castoroidinae). J. Morphol. 269:1387-1411, 2008.

AB The sustained decline in habitat quality and community integrity highlights the importance of understanding how communities and environmental variation interactively contribute to ecosystem services. We performed a laboratory experiment manipulating effects of acclimation temperature (5, 15, 25, and 35 degrees C) on resource acquisition, assimilation and subsequent ecosystem services provided by eight freshwater mussel species. Our results suggest that although freshwater mussels are broadly categorized as filter feeders, there are distinct nested functional guilds (thermally tolerant and sensitive) associated with their thermal performance. At 35 degrees C, thermally tolerant species have increased resource assimilation and higher rates of contributed ecosystem services (nutrient excretion, benthic-pelagic coupling). Conversely, thermally sensitive species have decreased assimilation rates and display an array of functional responses including increased/decreased benthic-pelagic coupling and nutrient excretion. Although thermally sensitive species may be in poorer physiological condition at warmer temperatures, their physiological responses can have positive effects on ecosystem services. We extrapolated these results to real mussel beds varying in species composition to address how shifts in community composition coupled with climate change may shift their contributed ecological services. Comparative field data indicate that two co-existing, abundant species with opposing thermal performance (Actinonaias ligamentina, Amblema plicata) differentially dominate community biomass. Additionally, communities varying in the relative proportion of these species differentially influence the magnitude (benthic-pelagic coupling) and quality (N:P excretion) of ecosystem services. As species are increasingly threatened by climate change, greater emphasis should be placed on understanding the contribution of physiological stress to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems.

AB Several recent studies have demonstrated that a functional approach (i.e. analysis of traits indicating species ecological functions) can be successfully used for river biomonitoring. To date this approach has only been applied in temperate rivers, even though it could notably contribute toward the development of an environmental assessment system in developing countries in other climatic zones. Using a multivariate approach (Fuzzy Correspondence Analysis-FCA). we analysed functional invertebrate community characteristics (described by 40 categories of seven biological traits mostly at the family level) at 66 stream sites from neotropical Bolivia with different level of anthropogenic disturbance. We were able to separate the sites on the first FCA axis (F1) (ANOVA test) following the predefined environmental quality classes based on the observed impact. Moreover, the F1 axis scores were significantly related to scores obtained using an independent macroinvertebrate multi-metric index previously developed to assess streams biotic condition in the same biogeographical region. The F1 axis, which thus represents a gradient of anthropogenic impacts, was significantly correlated to 30 of the 40 studied trait categories. Our results (i) clearly confirm the possible use of functional traits for water quality assessment in neotropical streams, and (ii) provides support to the River Habitat Templet hypothesis since habitat disturbances produced predictable functional changes in macroinvertebrate assemblages. Finally, this study supports the potential worldwide applicability of the species-trait approach as a biomonitoring tool for stream integrity assessment. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Information from lizard lineages that have evolved a highly elongate (snake-like) body form may clarify the selective forces important in the early evolution of snakes. Lizards have evolved bodily elongation via two distinct routes: as an adaptation to burrowing underground or to rapid locomotion above ground. These two routes involve diametrically opposite modifications to the body plan. Burrowing lizards have elongate trunks, small heads, short tails, and relatively constant body widths, whereas surface-active taxa typically have shorter trunks, wider heads, longer tails, and more variable body widths. Snakes resemble burrowing rather than surface-active (or aquatic) lizards in these respects, suggesting that snakes evolved from burrowing lizards. The trunk elongation of burrowing lizards increases the volume of the alimentary tract, so that an ability to ingest large meals (albeit consisting of small individual prey items) was present in the earliest snakes. Subsequent shifts to ingestion of wide-bodied prey came later, after selection dismantled other gape-constraining morphological attributes, some of which may also have arisen as adaptations to burrowing through hard soil (e.g. relatively small heads, rigid skulls). Adaptations of snake skulls to facilitate ingestion of large prey have evolved to compensate for the reduction of relative head size accompanying bodily elongation; relative to predator body mass, maximum sizes of prey taken by snakes may not be much larger than those of many lizards. This adaptive scenario suggests novel functional links between traits, and a series of testable predictions about the relationships between squamate morphology, habitat, and trophic ecology.

AB 1. Invertebrates and aquatic plants often play a key role in biogeochemical processes occurring at the water-sediment interface of aquatic ecosystems. However, few studies have investigated the respective influences of plants and bioturbating animals on ecological processes (nutrient fluxes, benthic oxygen uptake, microbial activities) occurring in freshwater sediments.
   2. We developed a laboratory experiment in aquaria to quantify the effects of (i) one invertebrate acting as a bioturbator (Tubifex tubifex); (ii) one submersed plant with a high sediment-oxygenating potential (Myriophyllum spicatum) and (iii) one submersed plant with a low sediment-oxygenating potential (Elodea canadensis).
   3. The tubificid worms significantly increased the fluxes of nitrogen at the water-sediment interface (influx of nitrate, efflux of ammonium), whereas the two plant species did not have significant influences on these nitrogen fluxes. The differences in nitrogen fluxes between tubificid worms and plants were probably due to the bioirrigation process caused by T. tubifex, which increased water exchanges at the water-sediment interface. Tubifex tubifex and M. spicatum produced comparable reductions of nutrient concentrations in pore water and comparable stimulations of benthic oxygen uptake and microbial communities (percentages of active eubacteria and hydrolytic activity) whereas E. canadensis had a very weak influence on these variables. These differences between the two plants were due to their contrasting abilities to increase oxygen in sediments by radial oxygen losses (release of oxygen from roots).
   4. Our study suggests that the bioirrigation process and radial oxygen loss are major functional traits affecting biogeochemical functioning at the water-sediment interface of wetlands.

AB The effect of Fucus vesiculosus on the functional traits of three harpacticoid copepod species (Tigriopus brevicornis, Paramphiascella fulvofasciata and Microarthridion littorale) was studied. These copepods are likely to be important grazers on biofilms consisting mainly of diatoms. Several microcosms were created using diatom cultures (Navicula phyllepta and Seminavis robusta) and vegetative thalli of Fucus, with the biofilm associated, collected from the field. The diatoms were enriched in the stable carbon C-13 to facilitate tracing in the harpacticoids. The biofilm on the Fucus was labeled through impregnation of the Fucus leaves in C-13 enriched seawater.
   In all treatments a measurable uptake of diatoms was found for the three copepod species. All copepods showed a low uptake of labeled material when only Fucus thalli were available. The grazing on the benthic diatoms was negatively affected by the presence of the Fucus thalli in the case of I? fulvofasciata. One species, T brevicornis, grazed efficiently both on sedimentary and epiphytic biofilms. We hereby proved experimentally that benthic harpacticoid copepods are able to switch their food uptake under different habitat/food circumstances. This variety of food uptake is an illustration of the so-called 'niche complementarity effect' that lies at the basis of diverse communities. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Marine-terrestrial resource flows can subsidies recipient consumers at various trophic levels. Theory suggests that the importance of such spatial subsidies depends on the productivity gradient between adjacent systems; however, the empirical data required to test this assumption are scarce. Most studies of marine-terrestrial subsidies have been performed in arid coastal habitats of low productivity surrounded by productive ocean waters. We examined the importance of marine resource inputs for terrestrial consumers on a temperate, productive forest island surrounded by a marine system of similar productivity. The importance of marine resources for the dominant arthropod consumers was estimated using stable isotopes and linear mixing models. We compared isotopic signatures of spiders and ants captured along a gradient from shore to inland to estimate how far marine-derived energy penetrates the island. We evaluated the distribution of ground-dwelling arthropods using pitfall-trap transects extending from the supratidal-forest boundary to the middle of the island. The contribution of marine-derived energy assimilated by arthropod consumers differed both among taxa and location. Marine-derived resources contributed > 80% to the assimilated C of intertidal spiders and 5-10% for spiders at the forest edge and further inland. Ants assimilated 20% of their C from marine-derived resources and this proportion was not affected by distance from shore. Spiders, ants, and all arthropods combined exhibited no spatial aggregation towards the shore. Our results indicate that on temperate islands marine-terrestrial subsidies might be predominantly an edge effect, confined to intertidal consumers. Mobile consumers that opportunistically forage in intertidal habitats play an important role in transferring marine-derived energy further inland. This suggests that the importance of the productivity gradient for spatial subsidies can be modified by the mobility traits of the recipient consumers and their degree of specialization on the interface habitat.

AB The differences between urban and rural streams regarding hydrological process, channel morphodynamics and ecosystem functioning have been highlighted by a number of studies in recent decades. The need to understand lotic ecosystem functioning in these environments at scales relevant to individual organisms has led to research focusing on hydraulic composition and structure over small areas of channel bed. In this study we map and analyze the hydraulic biotope composition of two urban and two rural stream reaches in the North Carolina (USA) Piedmont to determine if urban flow regimes and attendant channel modification processes might translate into important differences in hydraulic environment, and if so, what those differences are. Hydraulic biotope assemblages were found to vary only moderately in diversity per unit stream length between sites, but were distinctly different in composition. One important control on the differences between rural and urban streams was found to be the localized incision of urban channels into bedrock and saprolite. Resistant rock Outcrop in the beds of Urban streams creates rapid and riffle biotopes and long stretches of upstream pool habitat by impoundment. Urban reaches were found to be more homogeneous than rural reaches in hydraulic composition and were dominated by pools. Rural reaches, characterized by copious sandy alluvium in the bed, were dominated by runs or glides. Quantitative differentiation of biotopes based on four hydraulic indices generally yields coherent associations, although these may vary in content. Comparisons between hydraulic and biotic diversities suggest relationships favoring biotic functional group aggregation richness-based indices of diversity. Because the majority of published hydraulic diversity analyses are based on coarse-bed streams, further study of hydraulic diversity in streams with finer substrate is likely to be beneficial.

AB 1. Effective environmental management requires a sound understanding of the causal mechanisms underlying the relationship of species with their environment. Mechanistic explanations linking species and environment are ultimately based on species traits. Many tools for ecological assessment and biomonitoring lack such explanations. Elsewhere, we have defined life-history strategies, based on the interrelations between species traits and their functional implications.
   2. This study tests the hypothesis that life-history strategies represent different solutions to particular ecological problems, thus connecting species and their environment through species traits. Data on aquatic macroinvertebrates in a variety of waterbodies were analysed in terms of life-history strategies. These waterbodies differed in environmental conditions and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Solutions to the ecological problems present in each type of water body were expected to be reflected in the abundance of (species exhibiting) different life-history strategies.
   3. Results show clear differences in strategy composition between the different water types, which could be related to the prevailing environmental conditions through mechanistic explanations. For example, species with a long period of juvenile development and a synchronized emergence of short-lived adults were most dominant in large mesotrophic waterbodies with stable and predictable environmental conditions. In contrast, species that have a rapid development and spread successive reproduction attempts over a longer time period were most abundant in waterbodies with fluctuating and less predictable environmental conditions.
   4. Differences in strategy composition provide insight into the prevailing environmental conditions related to temporal predictability, and habitat favourability, from the perspective of the species themselves. By reducing diverse species assemblages to a small number of strategies, representing easily interpretable relationships, this approach may be useful in environmental quality assessment programmes, including those required by the European Water Framework Directive. Based on mechanistic explanations, life-history strategies may generate testable predictions and guide future research. Further research may focus on expanding life-history strategies to include other species groups and ecosystems.

AB 1. The extent to which conservation of biodiversity enforces the protection of ecosystem functioning. goods and services is a key issue in conservation ecology.
   2. In order to address this conservation issue. this work focused on community organization, linking community structure, as described both in taxonomic and functional terms, to community functioning and ecosystem process.
   3. Body size is an individual functional trait that is deterministically related to components of ecosystem functioning such as population dynamics and energy flow, and which determines components of community structure. Since body size is an individual trait that reflects numerous factors, it is also exposed to trait selection and the niche filtering underlying the community.
   4. An analysis of the relevance of body size to community organization in transitional water ecosystems in the eastern Mediterranean adn Black Sea regions is presented, based on field research conducted on a sample of 15 transitional water ecosystems.
   5. 250 taxa were identified, clumped in five orders of magnitude of body size. All bodt size patterns showed triangular distributions with an optimal size range of 0.13 mg to 1.0 mg individual body mass.
   6. Deterministic components of size structure were emphasized and a hierarchical organization with dominance of large sizes was demonstrated by the slopes of the body size-abundance distributions, consistently larger than the EER threshold (b=-0.75), and by the direct relationship of energy use to body size for most of the body size range.
   7. Consistent variations of body size-related descriptors were observed on three main gradients of environmental stress; cultrophication, cofinement and metal pollution.
   8. The results support the relevance of constraints imposed by individual body size on community organization in transitional water ecosystems and the adequacy of size patterns as an indicator for ecological conservation of these fragile ecosystems. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) is a powerful means for elucidating the geneticc architecture of gene regulation. Yet, eQTL mapping has not been applied toward investigatiing the regulation architecture of genes involved in the process of population divergence, ultimately leading to speciation events. Here, we conducted an eQTL mapping experiment to compare the genetic architecture of transcript regulation in adaptive traits, differentiating the recently evolved limnetic (dwarf) and benthic (normal) species pairs of lake whitefish. The eQTL were mapped in three data sets derived from an F(1) hybrid-dwarf backcrossed family: the entire set of 66 genotyped individuals and the two sexes treated separately. We identified strikingly more eQTL in the female data set (174), compared to both male (54) and combined (33) data sets. The majority of these genes were not differenetially expressed between male and female progeny of the backross family, thus providing evidence for a strong pleiotropic sex-linked effect in transcriptomic regulation. The subtelomeric region of a linkage group segregating in females encompassed > 50% of all eQTL, which exhibited the most pronounced additive effects. We also conducted a direct comparison of transcriptomic profiles between pure dwarf and normal progeny reared in controlled conditions. We detected 34 differentially expressed transcripts associated with eQTL segregating only in sex-specific data sets and mostly belonging to functional groups that differentiate dwarf and normal whitefish in natural populations. Therefore, these eQTL are not related to interindividual variation, but instead to the adaptive and historical genetic divergence between dwarf and normal whitefish. This study exemplifies how the integration of genetic and transcriptomic data offers a strong means for dissecitng the functional genomic response to selection by separating mapping family-specific effects from genetic factors under selection, potentially involved in the phenotypic divergence of natural populations.

AB In disturbed habitats, vegetative regeneration is partly ruled by plant reserves and intrinsic growth rates. Under nutrient-limiting conditions, perennial plants tend to exhibit an increased allocation to storage organs. Under mechanically stressful conditions, plants also tend to increase allocation to below-ground biomass and storage organs. We tested whether those stresses acting differently on plants (nutrient level versus mechanical forces) led to similar effect on storage organs and regeneration ability. We measured, for an aquatic plant species, (1) the size and allocation to storage organs (stems) and (2) the regeneration ability of the storage organs. Plant stems were collected in 4 habitats ranked along a nutrient stress gradient, and having encountered null versus significant mechanical stress (flowing water). All stems were placed in similar neutral conditions and left for a period of 6 weeks before measuring their survival and growth. Dry mass allocation to the storage organ (stem) was higher in stressful habitats. Moreover, stress encountered by plants before the experiment significantly affected regeneration: stems of previously stressed plants (i.e. plants that had grown in nutrient-poor or mechanically stressful habitats) survived better than unstressed ones. Stems of plants having encountered mechanical stress before the experiment had increased growth in nutrient-rich habitats but reduced growth in the poorest habitats. These results demonstrate that regeneration could rely on the level of stress previously encountered by plants. Stress could lead to greater regeneration ability following mechanical failure. The possible mechanisms involved in these results are discussed.

AB Marine protected areas are generally designed and managed on the basis of the presence and extent of specific habitat types or the habitats of important species. However, it has become clear that in addition to including these 'structural' elements of marine systems, management strategies should incorporate a consideration of the functional aspects of the ecosystems. Biological traits analysis (BTA) has been successfully used to describe ecological functioning in marine benthic systems. BTA uses a number of biological characteristics expressed by the taxa present as indicators of key ecosystem functions. Two expert workshops were used to examine the potential for the application of BTA in the designation and management of MPAs. They concluded that BTA represented the best tool currently available for quantifying ecological functioning and agreed on 10-key ecological functions delivered by marine benthic communities. Twenty-four biological traits were also identified by the workshops as indices of these ten functions. In order to demonstrate the practical utility of the approach, BTA using these traits, was applied to a dataset covering benthos from within and around the proposed Eddystone Special Area of Conservation (SW England). The case study demonstrated that with the type of data normally available from conservation assessment type surveys, and a knowledge of the relevant biological traits, it is possible to use a consideration of ecological functioning to set boundaries for the MPA and to inform the site management objectives. The use of structure and function information to inform the designation process and subsequent management of marine protected areas is discussed.

AB 1. The mechanisms that structure biological communities hold the key to understanding ecosystem functioning and the maintenance of biodiversity. Patterns of species abundances have been proposed as a means of differentiation between niche-based and neutral processes, but abundance information alone cannot provide unequivocal discrimination.
   2. We combined species niche information and species' relative abundances to test the effects of two opposing structuring mechanisms (environmental filtering and niche complementarity) on species' relative abundances in French lacustrine fish communities. The test involved a novel method comparing the abundance-weighted niche overlap within communities against that expected when relative abundances were randomized among species within the community.
   3. Observed overlap was consistently significantly lower than expected at random for two (swimming ability and trophic status) of four primary niche axes across lakes of differing physical environments. Thus, for these niche axes, pairs of abundant species tended to have relatively low niche overlap, while rare species tended to have relatively high niche overlap with abundant species.
   4. This suggests that niche complementarity may have acted to enhance ecosystem function and that it is important for species coexistence in these fish communities. The method used may be easily applied to any sort of biological community and thus may have considerable potential for determining the generality of niche complementarity effects on community structure.

AB I examined variability in the abundances of functional groups, functional diversity measures, and functional structure of littoral macroinvertebrate communities in relation to the environmental features of boreal lakes. The most important environmental variables shaping variation in the abundances of functional groups and functional structure were lake surface area, macrophyte cover, total phosphorous, and water hardness. The same environmental variables (i.e., lake surface area, macrophyte cover) accounted for variability in functional richness and functional diversity, while functional evenness was related to different environmental variables (i.e., hardness, color). Lake surface area and macrophyte cover comprised the most important axes of habitat templets shaping the functional trait structure and biodiversity in boreal lakes: lake area mirrors habitat differences between smaller and larger lakes, and macrophyte cover portrays the effects of habitat structural complexity on functional biodiversity. Functional biodiversity measures were also strongly correlated to species-level measures, and the correlation between similarity in functional and taxonomic structure was strong. Functional and taxonomic measures of macroinvertebrate communities thus provide rather similar information about littoral communities and ecosystem functioning.

AB Despite the wide range of locomotor adaptations in birds, little detailed attention has been given to the relationships between the quantitative structural characteristics of avian limb bones and bird behaviour. Possible differences in forelimb relative to hindlimb strength across species have been especially neglected. We generated cross-sectional, geometric data from peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans of the humerus and femur of 127 avian skeletons, representing 15 species of extant birds in 13 families. The sample includes terrestrial runners, arboreal perchers, hindlimb-propelled divers, forelimb-propelled divers and dynamic soarers. The hindlimb-propelled diving class includes a recently flightless island form. Our results demonstrate that locomotor dynamics can be differentiated in most cases based on cross-sectional properties, and that structural proportions are often more informative than bone length proportions for determining behaviour and locomotion. Recently flightless forms, for example, are more easily distinguished using structural ratios than using length ratios. A proper phylogenetic context is important for correctly interpreting structural characteristics, especially for recently flightless forms. Some of the most extreme adaptations to mechanical loading are seen in aquatic forms. Penguins have forelimbs adapted to very high loads. Aquatic species differ from non-aquatic species on the basis of relative cortical thickness. The combination of bone structural strength and relative cortical area of the humerus successfully differentiates all of our locomotor groups. The methods used in this study are highly applicable to fossil taxa, for which morphology is known but behaviour is not. The use of bone structural characteristics is particularly useful in palaeontology not only because it generates strong signals for many locomotor guilds, but also because analysing such traits does not require knowledge of body mass, which can be difficult to estimate reliably for fossil taxa.

AB We used a phylogenetically based comparative approach to evaluate the potential for physiological studies to reveal patterns of diversity in traits related to susceptibility to an environmental stressor, the trace metal cadmium (Cd). Physiological traits related to Cd bioaccumulation, compartmentalization, and ultimately susceptibility were measured in 21 aquatic insect species representing the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera. We mapped these experimentally derived physiological traits onto a phylogeny and quantified the tendency for related species to be similar (phylogenetic signal). All traits related to Cd bioaccumulation and susceptibility exhibited statistically significant phylogenetic signal, although the signal strength varied among traits. Conventional and phylogenetically based regression models were compared, revealing great variability within orders but consistent, strong differences among insect families. Uptake and elimination rate constants were positively correlated among species, but only when effects of body size and phylogeny were incorporated in the analysis. Together, uptake and elimination rates predicted dramatic Cd bioaccumulation differences among species that agreed with field-based measurements. We discovered a potential tradeoff, between the ability to eliminate Cd and the ability to detoxify it across species, particularly mayflies. The best-fit regression models were driven by phylogenetic parameters (especially differences among families) rather than functional traits, suggesting that it may eventually be possible to predict a taxon's physiological performance based on its phylogenetic position, provided adequate physiological information is available for close relatives. There appears to be great potential for evolutionary physiological approaches to augment our understanding of insect responses to environmental stressors in nature.

AB Relations between tissue trace element concentrations and species traits were examined for 45 fish species to determine the extent to which trait-based characteristics accounted for relative differences among species in trace element bioaccumulation. Percentages of fish species correctly classified by discriminant analysis according to traits predicted by tissue trace element concentrations ranged from 72% to 87%. Tissue concentrations of copper, mercury, selenium, and zinc appeared to have the greatest overall influence on differentiating species according to trait characteristics. Discrimination of trait characteristics did not appear to be strongly influenced by local sources of trace elements in the streambed sediment. Bioaccumulation was greatest for those species classified as primarily detritivores, having relatively large adult body size, considered nonmigratory with respect to reproductive strategy, occurring mostly in large or variable size streams and rivers, preferring depositional areas within the stream channel, and preferring benthic rather than open-water habitats. Our findings provide evidence of the strong relationship between bioaccumulation of environmental trace elements and trait-based factors that influence contaminant exposure.

AB To ensure comparability among leaf fresh mass measurements it is important to handle the leaves in a standardized manner. In the present work constraints of a commonly used method to achieve full turgor, storage between damp paper towels, were investigated. After overnight rehydration in a saturated atmosphere, the fresh mass of leaves of 14 species was measured, and the leaves were stored between paper towels (two treatments: moist and wet) at 4 degrees C. Their mass was measured after 24, 48, and 72 h. Leaf fresh mass increased during the first 24 h of storage between moist paper towels by an average of 1.8%, between wet towels by 3.3%. Among the species, the increase of leaf fresh mass between moist towels correlated with the species' desiccation propensity, indicating that it was rehydration from water loss during initial handling. On the other hand, between wet towels the fresh mass increase was associated with the species' leaf tissue structure, and it continued to increase beyond 24 h, indicating that the increase was a result of water penetration into the leaf air spaces. It is concluded that storage between moist paper towels results in reliable values of leaf fresh mass, and that desiccated leaves rehydrate well between moist towels. However, care has to be taken to avoid too wet conditions as they may lead to erroneously high fresh mass values, especially in species with large air spaces. Furthermore, exposure to unsaturated atmospheric conditions during handling has to be minimized.

AB The soft-bottom communities of eight Italian lagoons were analyzed for eight biological traits (feeding, mobility, adult life habitat, body size, life span, reproductive technique, type of larva and reproductive frequency) in order to identify the dominant traits in different transitional environments. We considered the ecological quality status (EcoQS) of the stations, assessed by two biotic indices, AMBI and Bentix. Stations were categorized into EcoQS classes to investigate the relationship between biological functions and ecological quality. The results indicate that the variability of the data was governed by traits linked to resource utilization rather than to life cycle. Lagoons affected by chronic disturbance displayed a poor functional composition, which usually corresponded to poor EcoQS in some cases, correlations between ecological groups and traits modalities were ecologically relevant; however, classes of EcoQS were found to be relatively independent from the functional structure of the considered stations.

AB Water availability is the most important factor determining tree species distribution in the tropics, but the underlying mechanisms are still not clear. In this study, we compared functional traits of 38 tropical tree species from dry and moist forest, and quantified their ability to survive drought in a dry-down experiment in which witting and survival were monitored. We evaluated how seedling traits affect drought survival, and how drought survival determines species distribution along the rainfall gradient. Dry forest species tended to have compound leaves, high stem dry matter content (stem dry mass/fresh mass), and low leaf area ratio, suggesting that reduction of transpiration and avoidance of xylem cavitation are important for their success. Three functional groups were identified based on the seedling traits: (1) drought avoiders with a deciduous leaf habitat and taproots; (2) drought resisters with tough tissues (i.e., a high dry matter content); and (3) light-demanding moist forest species with a large belowground foraging capacity. Dry forest species had a longer drought survival time (62 d) than moist forest species (25 d). Deciduousness explained 69 percent of interspecific variation in drought survival. Among evergreen species, stem density explained 20 percent of the drought survival. Drought survival was not related to species distribution along the rainfall gradient, because it was mainly determined by deciduousness, and species with deciduous seedlings are found in both dry and moist forests. Among evergreen species, drought survival explained 28 percent of the variation in species position along the rainfall gradient. This suggests that, apart from drought tolerance, other factors such as history, dispersal limitation, shade tolerance, and fire shape species distribution patterns along the rainfall gradient.

   GRADIENTS
AB Understanding patterns in terms of the mechanistic processes that produce them is the essence of ecology. However, many studies merely document nonrandom patterns of species coexistence without providing insight into the structuring mechanisms and their scale dependence. Moreover, few studies address the mechanisms driving functional diversity. The objectives of this study were to document empirical patterns of species coexistence within stream fish assemblages across a broad geographic region, addressing both the functional and taxonomic organization of those assemblages, and to determine whether the structuring mechanisms are scale dependent. We gathered data from a report published by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department that provided empirical species abundance distributions for 62 assemblages from 7 ecoregions and 18 river basins. For each assemblage, we simulated expected species abundances using five previously published models of niche apportionment. These models generate relative abundances in proportion to niche breadth and are constrained to maintain observed species richness, but they do not include information on species identity. These models included four stochastic variants of a geometric series (dominance preemption, random fraction, broken stick, and dominance decay) in which species abundances relate directly to niche breadth and one model (random assortment) in which abundances are independent of niche partitioning altogether. To assess scale dependence, we repeated the analyses after pooling assemblages by ecoregion, river basin, and the entire state. The patterns of niche apportionment for assemblages pooled according to river basin are more consistent with local assemblages than with assemblages pooled according to ecoregions or the entire state. These results suggest that niche apportionment plays a crucial role in structuring stream fish assemblages and that functional groups divide niche space more evenly than do species.

AB The clade Talpidae consists of specialized fossorial forms, shrew-like moles and semi-aquatic desmans. As with all higher jawed vertebrates, different functional, phylogenetic and developmental constraints act on different parts of dentary influencing its shape. In order to determine whether morphological variation in the dentary was unified or dispersed into an integrated complex of structural-functional components, a morphometric analysis of the mole dentary was undertaken. The dentary was subdivided into component parts - horizonal ramus; coronoid, condylar, angular processes of the ascending ramus - and outline-based geometric morphometric methods used to quantify, compare and contrast modes of shape variation within the clade. These were successful in revealing subtle differences and aspects of shape important in distinguishing between mole genera. Closer examination of shape variation within the two fully fossorial mole clades (Talpini and Scalopini) revealed several similarities in ascending ramus shapes between genera from each clade. For example, the broad, truncated appearance of the coronoid process in the talpine genera Talpa and Parascalops was shared with the scalopine genus Scapanus. Also, the more slender, hook-shaped coronoid process of Euroscaptor and Parascaptor (Talpini) closely resembles that of Scalopus (Scalopini). Interestingly, subspecies (one from each clade) more closely resembled genera other than their own in coronoid process shape. Important distinctions in horizontal ramus shape were found to exist between the two clades, such as the extent of curvature of the ventral margin and relative depth of the horizontal ramus. Results show shape variation in this region is correlated with dental formulae and the relative sizes of the teeth. The taxonomically important dentition differences characteristic of mammals are also reflected in the horizontal ramus results. Moreover, these results suggest size may be affecting shape and the extent of variation in, for example, the coronoid and condylar processes between the semi-aquatic moles Desmana and Galemys. It is likely that the effects of morphological integration seen at this level of analysis - covariation between shapes of dentary components - may exist because interacting traits are evolving together. Horizontal ramus and coronoid process shape, for example, are similar across Scapanus and Parascalops, but both these shapes have diverged in Scalopus.

   DIRECTIONAL SELECTION; GENETIC ARCHITECTURE; CICHLID FISHES; LABRID
   FISHES; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN; DIVERGENCE
AB Background: Evolutionary biologists want to explain the origin of novel features and functions. Two recent but separate lines of research address this question. The first describes one possible outcome of hybridization, called transgressive segregation, where hybrid offspring exhibit trait distributions outside of the parental range. The second considers the explicit mapping of form to function and illustrates manifold paths to similar function (called many to one mapping, MTOM) when the relationship between the two is complex. Under this scenario, functional novelty may be a product of the number of ways to elicit a functional outcome (i.e., the degree of MTOM). We fuse these research themes by considering the influence of MTOM on the production of transgressive jaw biomechanics in simulated hybrids between Lake Malawi cichlid species.
   Results: We characterized the component links and functional output (kinematic transmission, KT) of the 4-bar mechanism in the oral jaws of Lake Malawi cichlids. We demonstrated that the input and output links, the length of the lower jaw and the length of the maxilla respectively, have consistent but opposing relationships with KT. Based on these data, we predicted scenarios in which species with different morphologies but similar KT (MTOM species) would produce transgressive function in hybrids. We used a simple but realistic genetic model to show that transgressive function is a likely outcome of hybridization among Malawi species exhibiting MTOM. Notably, F-2 hybrids are transgressive for function (KT), but not the component links that contribute to function. In our model, transgression is a consequence of recombination and assortment among alleles specifying the lengths of the lower jaw and maxilla.
   Conclusion: We have described a general and likely pervasive mechanism that generates functional novelty. Simulations of hybrid offspring among Lake Malawi cichlids exhibiting MTOM produce transgressive function in the majority of cases, and at appreciable frequency. Functional transgression (i) is a product of recombination and assortment between alleles controlling the lengths of the lower jaw and the maxilla, (ii) occurs in the absence of transgressive morphology, and (iii) can be predicted from the morphology of parents. Our genetic model can be tested by breeding Malawi cichlid hybrids in the laboratory and examining the resulting range of forms and functions.

AB The small, non-rayed adipose fin is present in eight extant orders of fishes, including the Salmoniformes (salmon and trout) but the functional significance of the trait is unknown. Recent evidence suggests a hydrodynamic function in juvenile salmonids, and observations of sexually dimorphic adipose fin expression and female preference for males with large fins indicate a role in reproduction by mature individuals. To the extent that the adipose fin functions in reproduction, it might be expected to evolve in parallel with other sexually dimorphic traits, such as body depth and jaw length. To test this hypothesis, we quantified adipose fin size of mature male sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, among five populations. Populations differed significantly in adipose fin size after correcting for variation in body length and body depth. Adipose fin size tended to parallel the development of other secondary sexual characteristics, but was more closely related to body length and body depth than jaw length. Interestingly, shallow bodied populations from small creeks with high brown bear, Ursus arctos, predation during spawning tended to have smaller size-adjusted adipose fins than populations spawning in deeper water. However, it remains unclear whether adipose fin size is being selected independently of other traits or if it is pleoitropically linked to a trait under selection (e.g., body size or shape).

AB 1. In sub-Saharan Africa, tropical forests are increasingly threatened by accelerating rates of forest conversion and degradation. In East Africa, the larger tracts of intact rainforest lie largely in protected areas surrounded by converted landscape. Thus, there is critical need to understand the functional links between large-scale land use and changes in river conditions, and the implications of park boundaries on catchment integrity.
   2. The objective of this study was to use the mosaic of heavily converted land and pristine forest created by the protection of the high-altitude rainforest in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda to explore effects of deforestation on aquatic systems and the value of forest in buffering effects of adjacent land conversion. A set of 16 sites was selected over four drainages to include four categories of deforestation: agricultural land, deforested upstream (of the park boundary), forest edge (park boundary) and forest. We predicted that forest buffer (downstream or on the edge) would moderate effects of deforestation. To address this prediction, we quantified relationships between disturbance level and both physicochemical characters and traits of the macroinvertebrate assemblages during six sampling periods (February 2003 and June 2004).
   3. Results of both principal components analysis and cluster analyses indicated differences in limnological variables among deforestation categories. PC1 described a gradient from deforested sites with poor water quality to pristine forested sites with relatively good water quality. Agricultural sites and deforested upstream sites generally had the highest turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and conductivity values and low transparency values. Forest sites and boundary site groups generally exhibited low turbidity, TDS, and conductivity values and high water transparency values. Sites also clustered according to deforestation categories; forest and forested edge sites formed a cluster independent of both agricultural land and deforested-upstream.
   4. Water transparency, water temperature, and pH were the most important factors predicting benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Sensitive invertebrate families of Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Odonata dominated forested sites with high water transparency, low water temperature, and low pH while the tolerant families of Ephemeroptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, and Coleoptera were abundant in agriculturally impacted sites with low water transparency, high water temperature, and high pH.
   5. This study provides support for the importance of riparian buffers in moderating effects of deforestation. Forest and forested edge sites were more similar in both limnological and macroinvertebrate assemblage structure than sites within or downstream from agricultural lands. If the protected area cannot encompass the catchment, the use of rivers as park boundaries may help to maintain the biological integrity of the rivers by buffering one side of the watercourse.

AB The mechanisms, ways, and traits of acclimatization of aquatic animals within and outside their historical ranges are reviewed. It is shown on the example of the upper Volga basin that formation still continues of the fauna in reservoirs that began after their impoundment during 1930s-1950s. It is also shown that Ponto-Caspian invaders and intentionally introduced Baikal amphipods play a great role in this process. The data on the traits of biological cycles of mass nonindigenous invertebrates in upper Volga reservoirs are presented. The main ecological factors facilitating expansion of new species in reservoirs are demonstrated. It is shown that the assessment of the functional role of dreissena in waterbodies should include determination of the abundance of the larvae of this species in plankton.

AB Despite the progress achieved in elucidating the ecological mechanisms of adaptive radiation, there has been little focus on documenting the extent of adaptive differentiation in physiological functions during this process. Moreover, a thorough understanding of the genomic basis underlying phenotypic adaptive divergence is still in its infancy. One important evolutionary process for which causal genetic mechanisms are largely unknown pertains to life-history trade-offs. We analysed patterns of gene transcription in liver tissue of sympatric dwarf and normal whitefish from two natural lakes, as well as from populations reared in controlled environments, using a 16 006-gene cDNA microarray in order to: (i) document the extent of physiological adaptive divergence between sympatric dwarf and normal species pairs, and (ii) explore the molecular mechanisms of differential life history trade-offs between growth and survival potentially involved in their adaptive divergence. In the two natural lakes, 6.45% of significantly transcribed genes showed regulation either in parallel fashion (2.39%) or in different directions (4.06%). Among genes showing parallelism in regulation patterns, we observed a higher proportion of over-expressed genes in dwarf relative to normal whitefish (70.6%). Patterns observed in controlled conditions were also generally congruent with those observed in natural populations. Dwarf whitefish consistently showed significant over-expression of genes potentially associated with survival through enhanced activity (energy metabolism, iron homeostasis, lipid metabolism, detoxification), whereas more genes associated with growth (protein synthesis, cell cycle, cell growth) were generally down-regulated in dwarf relative to normal whitefish. Overall, parallelism in patterns of gene transcription, as well as patterns of interindividual variation across controlled and natural environments, provide strong indirect evidence for the role of selection in the evolution of differential regulation of genes involving a vast array of potentially adaptive physiological processes between dwarf and normal whitefish. Our results also provide a first mechanistic, genomic basis for the observed trade-off in life-history traits distinguishing dwarf and normal whitefish species pairs, wherein enhanced survival via more active swimming, necessary for increased foraging and predator avoidance, engages energetic costs that translate into slower growth rate and reduced fecundity in dwarf relative to normal whitefish.

AB We investigated whether plasticity in growth responses to nutrients could predict invasive potential in aquatic plants by measuring the effects of nutrients on growth of eight non-invasive native and six invasive exotic aquatic plant species. Nutrients were applied at two levels, approximating those found in urbanized and relatively undisturbed catchments, respectively. To identify systematic differences between invasive and non-invasive species, we compared the growth responses (total biomass, root:shoot allocation, and photosynthetic surface area) of native species with those of related invasive species after 13 weeks growth. The results were used to seek evidence of invasive potential among four recently naturalized species. There was evidence that invasive species tend to accumulate more biomass than native species (P = 0.0788). Root:shoot allocation did not differ between native and invasive plant species, nor was allocation affected by nutrient addition. However, the photosynthetic surface area of invasive species tended to increase with nutrients, whereas it did not among native species (P = 0.0658). Of the four recently naturalized species, Hydrocleys nymphoides showed the same nutrient-related plasticity in photosynthetic area displayed by known invasive species. Cyperus papyrus showed a strong reduction in photosynthetic area with increased nutrients. H. nymphoides and C. papyrus also accumulated more biomass than their native relatives. H. nymphoides possesses both of the traits we found to be associated with invasiveness, and should thus be regarded as likely to be invasive.

AB Understanding the causes and consequences of species extinctions is a central goal in ecology. Faced with the difficult task of identifying those species with the greatest need for conservation, ecologists have turned to using predictive suites of ecological and life-history traits to provide reasonable estimates of species extinction risk. Previous studies have linked individual traits to extinction risk, yet the nonadditive contribution of multiple traits to the entire extinction process, from species rarity to local extirpation to global extinction, has not been examined. This study asks whether trait synergisms predispose native fishes of the Lower Colorado River Basin (USA) to risk of extinction through their effects on rarity and local extirpation and their vulnerability to different sources of threat. Fish species with "slow'' life histories ( e. g., large body size, long life, and delayed maturity), minimal parental care to offspring, and specialized feeding behaviors are associated with smaller geographic distribution, greater frequency of local extirpation, and higher perceived extinction risk than that expected by simple additive effects of traits in combination. This supports the notion that trait synergisms increase the susceptibility of native fishes to multiple stages of the extinction process, thus making them prone to the multiple jeopardies resulting from a combination of fewer individuals, narrow environmental tolerances, and long recovery times following environmental change. Given that particular traits, some acting in concert, may differentially predispose native fishes to rarity, extirpation, and extinction, we suggest that management efforts in the Lower Colorado River Basin should be congruent with the life-history requirements of multiple species over large spatial and temporal scales.

AB 1. The power of selected biological invertebrate traits for discriminating different types of human impact (heavy metal pollution and cargo-ship traffic) were tested using ecological reasoning and linear Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA).
   2. Frequency distributions of individual traits and categories of traits from 68 least impacted river reaches (LIRRs) and 304 impacted river reaches were used to define simple assessment rules based on ecological reasoning for specific impairments in large European rivers. In calibration, a maximum of three variables with a priori predictions and two different impairment threshold levels were used. Similarly, DFA was performed on the same variables included in the ecological reasoning approach, but also on all available traits or trait categories.
   3. Validation with an independent data set (40 LIRRs, 291 variously impacted river reaches) and using the ecological reasoning approach showed that 75-78% of the reaches were correctly assign with rules on all impact types, 35-57% with rules on heavy metal pollution and 78-93% with rules on cargo-ship traffic. By comparison, validation showed that DFA performed globally poorer than the ecological reasoning approach. In addition, the performance of the rules based on ecological reasoning remained stable, whereas DFA performance changed between calibration and validation.
   4. Although not defined for this purpose, our study provided alarming evidence regarding the impact of cargo-ship traffic on invertebrate communities in river reaches. Reaches with cargo-ship traffic were found to have more genera with long life cycles that reproduce repeatedly by ovoviviparity and have a sessile life.
   5. The performance of our trait-based approach to correctly assign reaches to either least impacted or impacted conditions should promote further research on the topic across larger geographic areas (without regionalization) and across smaller stream types to provide a powerful biomonitoring tool that fulfils current European Union directives.

AB 1. Interspecific niche differences have long been identified as a major explanation for the occurrence of species-rich communities. However, much fieldwork studying variation in local species richness has focused upon physical habitat attributes or regional factors, such as the size of the regional species pool.
   2. We applied indices of functional diversity and niche overlap to data on the species niche to examine the importance of interspecific niche differentiation for species richness in French lake fish communities. We combined this information with environmental data to test generalizations of the physiological tolerance and niche specialization hypotheses for species-energy relationships.
   3. We found evidence for a largely non-saturating relationship (relative to random expectation) between species richness and functional evenness (evenness of spacing between species in niche space), while functional richness (volume of niche space occupied) peaked at moderate levels of species richness and niche overlap showed an initial decrease followed by saturation. This suggests that increased niche specialization may have allowed species to coexist in the most species-rich communities.
   4. We tested for evidence that increased temperature, local habitat area, local habitat diversity and immigration affected species richness via increased niche specialization. Temperature explained by far the largest amount of variation in species richness, functional diversity and niche overlap. These results, combined with the largely non-saturating species richness-functional evenness relationship, suggest that increased temperature may have permitted increased species richness by allowing increased niche specialization.
   5. These results emphasize the importance of niche differences for species coexistence in species-rich communities, and indicate that the conservation of functional diversity may be vital for the maintenance of species diversity in biological communities. Our approach may be applied readily to many types of community, and at any scale, thus providing a flexible means of testing niche-based hypotheses for species richness gradients.

AB Feeding kinematics, suction and hydraulic jetting capabilities of bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) were characterized during controlled feeding trials. Feeding trials were conducted both on land and in water, and allowed a choice between suction and biting, but food was also presented that could be ingested by suction alone. Four feeding phases, preparatory, jaw opening, hyoid depression and jaw closing were observed; the mean feeding cycle duration was 0.54 +/- 0.22 s, regardless of feeding mode (P > 0.05). Subjects feeding on land used biting and suction 89.3% and 10.7% of the time, respectively. Subjects feeding in water used suction and hydraulic jetting 96.3% and 3.7% of the time, respectively. No biting behavior was observed underwater. Suction feeding was characterized by a small gape (2.7 +/- 0.85 cm), small gape angle (24.4 +/- 8.13), pursing of the rostral lips to form a circular aperture, and pursing of the lateral lips to occlude lateral gape. Biting was characterized by large gape (7.3 +/- 2.2 cm), large gape angle (41.7 +/- 15.2 degrees), and lip curling to expose the teeth. An excavation behavior in which suction and hydraulic jetting were alternated was used to extract food from recessed wells. The maximum subambient and suprambient pressures recorded were 91.2 and 53.4 kPa, respectively. The inclusion of suction data for phocids broadens the principle that suction feeding kinematics is conserved among aquatic vertebrates. Furthermore, bearded seals support predictions that mouth size, fluid flow speed, and elusiveness of prey consumed are among a suite of traits that determine the specific nature of suction feeding among species.

AB Ultraviolet solar radiation (UVR) and atmospheric nutrient loads to pristine ecosystems are global climate change phenomena that simultaneously affect aquatic organisms in ways not easily predicted by single factor studies. Plankton in a high mountain lake was exposed in situ to increasing phosphorus (P) concentrations (mimicking atmospheric pulses) in absence or presence of UVR in order to identify their interactive effect on functional [primary production, organic carbon (C) release (EOC), and percentage of C released (%EOC)], growth rate, structural-physiological (algal biomass, sestonic C, P content, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and Chl a:C ratio, P cell quota, cell-specific Chl a), and stoichiometric (autotroph C: P ratio) traits. The availability of P after the pulse determined the intensity of responses by primary producers to UVR stress. All structural-physiological and functional variables significantly increased by up to two orders of magnitude in response to P enrichment. UV radiation, over a long-term scale, exerted significant deleterious effects on most structural-physiological variables when inorganic P was added at high levels (>= 30 mu g PL-1). The subsequent unexpected negative synergistic UVR x P effect on algal development did not support our initial hypothesis that P input might buffer the harmful UVR effect. UVR exerted a weak negative effect on primary production but strongly enhanced the absolute and percentage excretion of C (up to 60%), mechanism responsible of a significant reduction in autotroph C: P ratios. We propose that low sestonic C:P ratios are the outcome of an adaptive strategy of algae in environments with high UVR exposure and extreme nutrient limitation and have important implications for C flux through grazing vs. microbial food webs in oligotrophic systems.

AB The influence of water permanence and high intra- and inter-annual hydrological variability on macrobenthos (organisms > 1 mm) was studied using a taxonomical and a functional approach. The study was carried out in a Mediterranean salt marsh. Monthly samples of macrobenthic fauna were collected during two consecutive hydroperiods from six ponds with different water permanence (temporary, semi-permanent and permanent waters). Organisms were assigned to five functional response groups based on life-strategies according to their capacity to survive desiccation events, their dispersion capability and the necessity of water for their reproduction. Results from both approaches showed that the benthic community was more related to pond type than to intra- and inter-annual variability. The second aim was to analyse to which extent patterns in functional groups were determined by the existence of succession patterns or to environmental variability. In this sense, a clear succession pattern was not observed. In contrast, in most of the functional groups (4 out of 5), species within each functional group showed similar responses to water fluctuations. However, species of the fifth functional group, which comprised species without any particular adaptation to desiccation survival or avoidance, showed different responses to water level fluctuations.

AB [1] Using radiative reflectance as the discriminatory functional trait, we find scale-free signatures of local functional diversity density of vegetation in river basins, implying a high likelihood of locations with very high diversity relative to the overall diversity of the riparian systems (i. e., riparian diversity hot spots). The spatial series of average local functional diversity exhibits correlation structures that indicate long-range communication of diversity information along river networks. The riparian area of a randomly selected streamlink is found to be exponentially distributed. Our findings suggest that landscape structure and dispersal directionality play crucial roles in determining biodiversity patterns, and thus should be addressed in comprehensive biodiversity theories and fieldwork and conservation campaigns. Finally, the connection between the spectral-group-based functional diversity signatures and those associated with the actual species richness is yet to be verified and quantified; such connection will significantly enhance the importance of the already meaningful signatures reported here.

AB Wheat Fusarium head blight (FHB) may cause serious losses in grain yield and quality in China. More than 7 million hectares which approximately accounts for 25% of the total areas in China is infected by the disease. The cultivation of wheat varieties with resistance to Fusarium head blight is recognized as one of the most important components to diminish losses due to this disease. Chinese wheat breeders have commenced the research on FHB since 1950s. Wheat cultivars with improved FHB resistance were developed through conventional breeding. Some famous resistant varieties such as Sumai 3, Yangmai 158 and Ning 7840 were released from Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, these varieties were widely applied in wheat production and breeding programs. Significant achievements concerning molecular mapping and marker assisted selection have been made in the past decade. The major QTL on chromosome 3BS was identified and located in the same region on chromosome 3BS in Sumai 3, Ning 894037, Wangshuibai, and Chinese Spring. Using SSR marker in this QTL region for assisted selection, some lines with the same resistance to FHB were obtained. New STS markers and SSCP markers were developed and will be tested for the efficiency of MAS. However, further achievements are still hindered by a number of constraints. More FHB resistance genetic resources from landrace in middle to lower reaches of Yangtze River are necessary to be used for improving FHB resistant. The genetic mechanism of the varieties contributing the resistance to improved cultivars is needed to be understood. Development of functional markers for FHB is discussed.

AB Macrobenthic recolonisation patterns after complete defaunation resulting from experimentally induced hypoxia were investigated in a polyhaline, estuarine mudflat. Based on simultaneous sampling of biotic and environmental variables in replicated 16 m(2) control and defaunated plots, with a high resolution in time during 6 mo, the ecological interactions related to the macrobenthos reassembly were elucidated. Colonisation was predominantly determined by juvenile recruitment, and 3 successional stages were identified, each characterised by different species assemblages and environmental characteristics. During recovery, a shift in functional group dominance from mobile surface deposit feeders to tube-dwelling surface deposit feeders to biodestabilising taxa occurred, while their proportional dominance remained quite stable in the control plots throughout the experiment. Species colonisation patterns of later colonists revealed positive interactions with early colonising opportunistic tube-building polychaetes Pygospio elegans, while later successional species (Heteromastus filiformis, Macoma balthica) adversely affected the stable, favourable conditions created by the tube-building infauna, Transitions between different successional stages were related to recruitment of species, changes in environmental characteristics (oxygenation state of the sediment), direct and indirect ecological interactions (bio [de]stabilisation, exploitation competition for food), In general, our study suggests that macrobenthic reassembly after hypoxia is related to different types of interactions, all acting in a unique manner. Hence, macrobenthic successional dynamics in a tidal mudflat habitat should be considered as a dynamic process, related to resource availability, natural temporal variation, life history traits (e.g. opportunistic behaviour) and bio-engineering capacities of the colonising species.

AB While bryozoans are important components of marine benthic ecosystems, their significance as food has scarcely been considered in any comparative study. An analysis of the phylogenetic range of predators on bryozoan colonies was undertaken to elucidate relationships among different consumers. Functional feeding traits and diet categories were determined from literature sources and observations for 399 predator species. Multivariate analyses were used to identify groups of species that consume similar food resources and have related functional traits corresponding to finding, acquiring and ingesting prey. These analyses distinguished gradients among trophic groups based on dissimilar feeding mechanisms, body sizes, types of locomotion and dietary breadths. Co-occurrences of certain diet categories also emerged as important factors. Trophic groups were largely consistent with species clusters at different taxonomic ranks among the predator phyla. At one extreme, fishes and decapod crustaceans with large dietary breadths and body sizes, and crushing or tearing feeding mechanisms, appear to consume bryozoans as minor or even incidental parts of their diets. At another extreme, species of nudibranchs, pycnogonids, turbellarians, and certain polychaetes, small arthropods and nematodes that consume bryozoans do so primarily or exclusively. Their body sizes are comparatively smaller and they often have piercing and suctorial feeding mechanisms. These differences are associated by inference with different probabilities of antagonistic encounters and likelihoods of lethal or sublethal predation. The analyses provide a baseline for ecological and evolutionary comparisons, and a broader context for the questions, 'Who eats bryozoans, how, and how frequently?'.

AB Understanding the role of history in the formation of communities has been a major challenge in community ecology. Here, we explore the role of phenotypic plasticity and its associated trait-mediated indirect interactions as a mechanism behind priority effects. Using organisms with inducible defenses as a model system, we examine how aquatic communities initially containing different predator environments are affected at the individual and community level by the colonization of a second predator. Snails and tadpoles were established in four different caged-predator environments (no predator, fish, crayfish or water bugs). These four communities were then crossed with three predator colonization treatments (no colonization, early colonization, or late colonization) using lethal water bugs as the predator. The snails responded to the caged predator environments with predator-specific behavioral and morphological defenses. In the colonization treatments, snails possessing the wrong phenotype attempted to induce phenotypic changes to defend themselves against the new risk. However, snails initially induced by a different predator environment often suffered high predation rates. Hence, temporal variation in predation risk not only challenged the snail prey to try to track this environmental variation through time by adjusting their defensive phenotypes, but also caused trait-mediated interactions between snails and the colonizing predator. For tadpoles within these communities, there was little evidence that the morphological responses of snails indirectly effected tadpole predation rates by colonizing water bugs. Unexpectedly, predation rates on tadpoles by colonizing water bugs were generally higher in the three caged-predator treatments, suggesting that water bugs elevated their foraging activity in response to potentially competing predators. In summary, we demonstrate an important priority effect in which the initial occurrence of one species of predator can facilitate predation by a second predator that colonizes at a later date (i.e. a TMII) suggesting that phenotypic plasticity can be an important driver behind priority effects (i.e. historical exposure to predators).

AB The vegetation communities of the trampled habitats in the Plitvice Lakes National Park were studied during 2005 and 2006. With the numerical classification of the releves, six clusters were obtained, corresponding to the following specific communities: cluster 1-ass. Matricario-Polygonetum arenastri- the intensively trampled and grazed habitats; cluster 2-ass. Matricario-Polygonetum arenastri- the only intensively trampled habitats; cluster 3-ass. Coronopodo-Polygonetum arenastri- very intensively trampled and grazed farmyards; cluster 4 -Trifolium fragiferum community-the trampled surfaces of moist habitats; cluster 5-ass. Lolietum perennis- the moderately trampled surfaces of roads and yards; cluster 6-ass. Prunello-Ranunculetum repentis- trampled surfaces of forest roads. The first three clusters belong to the vegetation of intensively trampled habitats of the class Polygono arenastri-Poetea annuae and the last three clusters belong to moderately trampled habitats of the class Molinio-Arrhenatheretea. In the analysis of the ecological factors it is established that separation of the releves is influenced most greatly by the trampling intensity observed in the field, and of the Ellenberg indicator values, the most important are light, moisture, soil reaction and temperature. Using the analysis of the plant functional traits it is established that therophytes, annuals, biennials, species resistant to trampling and grazing, neophytes and archeophytes prevail in the intensively trampled habitats. In contrast, hemicryptophytes, perennials, and indigenous plant species prevail in the moderately trampled habitats. Representation of the C-S-R plant functional types shows also that trampling as a disturbance factor has a large influence on the differences in the releves. In the intensively trampled habitats, there is a large proportion of ruderals, while in the moderately trampled habitats there is a large proportion of competitors.

AB Phenotypic plasticity widely exists in the external morphology of animals as well as the internal traits of organs. In the present study, we studied the gut length plasticity of planktivorous filter-feeding silver carp under different food resources in large-net cage experiments in Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu in 2004 and 2005. There was a significant difference in stocking density between these 2 years. Under a low stocking density and abundant food resources, silver carp increased their energy intake by feeding on more zooplankton. Meanwhile, silver carp adjusted their gut length to match the digestive requirements of food when exposed to different food resources. In the main growth seasons (from April to October), silver carp significantly increased their relative gut length when feeding on more phytoplankton in 2005 (p < 0.01, 9.23 +/- 1.80 in 2004 and 10.77 +/- 2.05 in 2005, respectively). There was a nearly significant negative correlation between zooplankton proportion in the diet and the relative gut length when silver carp were stocked in a high density (p = 0.112). It appears that silver carp might have evolved plasticity to change their gut length rapidly to facilitate efficient utilization of food resources. Such resource polymorphisms in the gut may be a good indication of temporal adaptation to resource conditions. Our work provided field evidence for understanding the functional basis of resource polymorphisms and the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in planktivorous filter-feeding fish.

AB Trait-based approaches to community structure are increasingly used in terrestrial ecology. We show that such an approach, augmented by a mechanistic analysis of trade-offs among functional traits, can be successfully used to explain community composition of marine phytoplankton along environmental gradients. Our analysis of literature on major functional traits in phytoplankton, such as parameters of nutrient-dependent growth and uptake, reveals physiological trade-offs in species abilities to acquire and utilize resources. These trade-offs, arising from fundamental relations such as cellular scaling laws and enzyme kinetics, define contrasting ecological strategies of nutrient acquisition. Major groups of marine eukaryotic phytoplankton have adopted distinct strategies with associated traits. These diverse strategies of nutrient utilization can explain the distribution patterns of major functional groups and size classes along nutrient availability gradients.

AB Large river floodplains potentially include the full range of freshwater ecosystems from permanently flowing channels to temporary pools and springs. Attempts to restore such complex systems require tools adapted to assess restoration success. In an analysis of invertebrate assemblages in the Rhone River floodplain (France), taxonomic-based indices (rarefied richness and assemblage composition) were compared with functional metrics using trait-based ratios as surrogates of ecosystem processes. Their ability to respond to a gradient of hydrological connectivity was assessed in 7 cut-off channels. The sampling design included 2 sites/channel (upstream and downstream), 4 randomly chosen sampling points (0.5 x 0.5-m quadrats)/site, and 2 sampling seasons (spring and summer). Water physicochemical and habitat variables were recorded when invertebrates were sampled. Environmental variables, including water conductance, [NH3-N], submerged vegetation cover, diversity of sediment grain size, and organic matter content of the sediment, were used to construct a synthetic variable describing the hydrological connectivity of each site with the main river channel. A quadratic regression of rarefied taxonomic richness and the connectivity gradient was not quite significant, but assemblage composition was strongly related to the gradient. Four of 8 trait-based metrics; were correlated with the connectivity gradient. Values of metrics that are surrogates for top-down control of assemblage structure and habitat stability (based on functional feeding groups) declined along the gradient from disconnected sites to more connected sites. Values of metrics that are surrogates for voltinism and food supply for water-column-feeding fish increased with connectivity. Top-down control and voltinism surrogates suggested a decline in predator-prey relationships and lower habitat stability, respectively, in the more connected sites. Assemblage composition and some of the trait-based metrics were sensitive to a flood that occurred before one of the sampling dates. Some of the trait-based metrics showed potential for explaining floodplain invertebrate assemblages and for monitoring postrestoration conditions in floodplain water bodies. However, the metrics were developed initially for studies of lotic systems and their use in heterogeneous floodplain water bodies will require further investigation, e.g., delineation of reference conditions for trait-based metrics.

AB Studies of inducible defenses have traditionally examined prey responses to one predator at a time. However, prey in nature encounter combinations of predators that should force them to produce phenotypic compromises. We examined how snails (Helisoma trivolvis) alter their phenotype in the presence of three different predator species that were presented alone and in pairwise combinations. When snails were exposed to each predator alone, they formed predator-specific defenses that reflected the differences in each predator's foraging mode. When snails were exposed to pairwise combinations of predators, their phenotype was dependent on their ability to detect each predator, the risk posed by each predator, and the effectiveness of a given defense against each predator. Consequently, responses to combined predators were typically biased towards one of the predators in the pair. This suggests that prey facing combined predators do not form simple intermediate defenses and, as a result, may experience enhanced mortality risk when they encounter natural predator regimes.

AB Complex physiological traits, such as routine aerobic metabolic rate or exercise performance, are indicators of the functional integrity of fish that can reveal sub-lethal toxicological effects of aquatic pollutants. These traits have proved valuable in laboratory investigations of the sub-lethal effects of heavy metals, ammonia and various xenobiotics. It is not known, however, whether they can also function as biomarkers of the complex potential range of effects upon overall functional integrity caused by exposure to mixtures of chemicals in polluted natural environments. The current study used portable swimming respirometers to compare exercise performance and respiratory metabolism of fish exposed in cages for three weeks to either clean or polluted sites on three urban European river systems: the river Lambro, Milan, Italy; the rivers Blythe, Cole and Tame, Birmingham, UK; and the river Amstel, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The UK and Italian rivers were variously polluted with high levels of both bioavailable heavymetals and organics, and the Amstel by mixtures of bioavailable organics at high concentrations. In both the UK and Italy, indigenous chub (Leuciscus cephalus) exposed to clean or polluted sites swam equally well in an initial performance test, but the chub from polluted sites could not repeat this performance after a brief recovery interval. These animals were unable to raise the metabolic rate and allocate oxygen towards exercise in the second trial, an effect confirmed in successive campaigns in Italy. Swimming performance was therefore a biomarker indicator of pollutant exposure in chub exposed at these sites. Exposure to polluted sites on the river Amstel did not affect the repeat swimming performance of cultured cloned carp ( Cyprinus carpio), indicating either a species-specific tolerance or relative absence of heavy metals. However, measurements of oxygen uptake during swimming revealed increased rates of routine aerobic metabolism in both chub and carp at polluted sites in all of the rivers studied, indicating a sub-lethal metabolic loading effect. Therefore, the physiological traits of exercise performance and metabolic rate have potential as biomarkers of the overall sub-lethal toxic effects of exposure to complex mixtures of pollutants in rivers, and may also provide insight into why fish do not colonize some polluted environments.

AB A peculiar relationship exists between population genetics and invasion biology. Introduced populations often suffer a depletion of genetic variation, but they can persist and adapt to new environments. Here, we show that this relationship is observed in bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), an invasive exotic fish in Japan. Genetic analysis using selectively neutral genetic markers reconfirmed that the bluegill introduced into Japan from the United States in 1960 had a single origin with only 15 founders. The analysis also shows that in the process of range expansion, the introduced bluegills experienced severe depletion of genetic diversity due to the founder effect and/or genetic drift. Despite such a decline in genetic diversity, the bluegill populations exhibited a divergent feeding morphology in response to the colonized environments. Such a morphological divergence can facilitate prey exploitation, thereby causing a greater negative impact on native prey resources. Further, in a trophically polymorphic bluegill population in Lake Biwa, physiological characteristics and genetic structures of the intestinal bacterial communities were associated with the difference in diet among the trophic morphs in the host bluegill population. This empirical evidence suggests that despite the severe decline in genetic diversity, the introduced bluegill populations rapidly adapted to the new environment and formed diverse functional relationships with the native bacterial community. Thus, these findings suggest that genetic variation at selectively neutral markers does not always predict adaptability and invasiveness in introduced populations.

AB This study aimed at comparing the composition, the structure and the organisation of con ticolous bryophyte assemblages (recorded within a 400 m(2) plot) between three silvicultural managements widely conducted in Europe: Even-Aged pure beech Forest (EAF), Coppice With Standards system (CWS) and Selective Cutting systems (SC). The stands used for the study were located in two neighbouring regions of northern France. Comparisons were performed using a functional approach based on species' ecological requirements and life traits combined with multivariate analyses. Along the silvicultural cycle of the EAF, stand age and canopy opening were the main ecological factors influencing corticolous bryophyte assemblages. Old stands with a low canopy cover contained all the functional groups, with a preponderance of late successional and obligatory shade species. The regeneration stage appeared to be an outlier because of its lowest species richness. Although the same functional groups occurred in CWS and SC as in EAF, the bryophyte assemblages shared compositional and structural characteristics similar to those of EAF early and middle successional stages. This indicates that successional processes are not maintained by these management types and that the latter do not seem to favour late successional-obligatory shade species. EAF successional stages, CWS and SC did not exhibit differences in the relative species richness (i.e. the ratio between the number of species within the 400 m(2) plot (SR) and the richness of the local species pool) except for EAF regeneration stands.
   The results are used to propose practical ecological background information for the elaboration of forest management policies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between form and function has been a central organizing principle in biology throughout its history as a formal science. This concept has been relevant from molecules to organisms but loses meaning at population and community levels where study targets are abstract collectives and assemblages. Ecosystems include organisms and abiotic factors but ecosystem ecology too has developed until recently without a strong spatially explicit reference. Landscape ecology provides an opportunity to once again anneal form and function and to consider reciprocal causation between them. This ecomorphologic view can be applied at a variety of ecologically relevant scales and consists of an investigation of how geomorphology provides a structural template that shapes, and is shaped by ecological processes. Running water ecosystems illustrate several principles governing the interaction of landscape form and ecological function subsumed by the concept of "Functional Ecomorphology". Particularly lucrative are ecosystem-level interactions between geologic form and biogeochemical processes integrated by hydrologic flowpaths. While the utility of a flowpath-based approach is most apparent in streams, spatially explicit biogeochemical processing pervades all landscapes and may be of general ecological application.

AB The interplay of biological and physical patterns and processes within river ecosystems generates a complex matrix of interactions. A challenge in interdisciplinary river science is to dissect patterns and processes in multi-causal river ecosystems into hierarchical levels of organization. Hierarchy theory, and the associated concept of scale, provides a sound framework for achieving this. We present two interdisciplinary case studies that demonstrate how a multi-scale approach can dissect hierarchies of organization in river ecosystems. The first case study examined patterns of large wood character and distribution at three scales of a hierarchy of morphological river system organization in the large, lowland River Murray. The character and distribution of large wood was uniform at the largest reach scale (95 km length of river) because stream energy conditions are relatively uniform within the reach. However, there was an association between lower-level functional sets (straight or bend sections of river) and functional units (12 quadrats within each functional set) and the character and distribution of large wood, because stream energy differs between straight and bend morphologies, and the inner- and outer-channel functional units. Thus, functional sets and functional units are important levels of organization for large wood in the River Murray. The second case study examined the associations between macroinvertebrate assemblage distribution and environmental influences across a hierarchy of river system organization in the upland Murrumbidgee River catchment. We previously demonstrated that macroinvertebrate assemblages were arranged hierarchically at the region, cluster within region, reach within cluster and riffle within reach scales, with region and reach being the strongest signatures. In this study we related different scaled environmental factors, collected across a hierarchy of catchment, zone (valley confinement), reach (similar stream orders) and riffle scales to the region and cluster levels of macro invertebrate distribution. The hierarchical pattern of large, region-level and local, reach-level macroinvertebrate distribution was matched by a large catchment-scale and local reach-scale of environmental influence. Intermediate zone-scale environmental factors and smaller riffle-scale factors were not important influences. Thus, large regions and catchments and local reaches are important levels of organization for macroinvertebrate-environment associations in rivers of the upper Murrumbidgee catchment. Both case studies support the applicability of hierarchy theory to describe the organization of physical-biological associations in river ecosystems. The multi-scaled approach allowed the detection of levels of hierarchical organization, and showed other hierarchical characteristics such as emergent properties and top-down constmint/bottomup influence. Hierarchical understanding of river ecosystem organization will enhance river conservation and management because it facilitates a holistic, ecosystem perspective rather than a partial, single-scale, single-component or single-discipline perspective.

To link pesticide exposure and community composition we applied the trait-based Species At Risk (SPEAR) indicator system.
   In the French region, pesticide stress was associated with a decrease in the relative abundance and number of sensitive species in the communities. The presence of undisturbed upstream reaches partly compensated the effects of pesticide contamination. Functional effects of pesticides were identified by a 2.5-fold reduction of the leaf-litter breakdown rate that was closely correlated with the structural changes in the contaminated streams. No effects of pesticides were observed in Finnish streams since contamination with pesticides was very low.
   In a follow-up analysis, the SPEAR approach successfully discriminated between reference and contaminated sites across different biogeographical regions, also including results of a previous field study in North Germany. Furthermore, change of the community structure was detectable at a concentration range as low as 1/100 to 1/1000 the acute 48 h-LC50 of Daphnia magna.
   Our findings demonstrate that pesticides may influence the structure and function of lotic ecosystems and that the SPEAR approach can be used as a powerful tool in biomonitoring over large spatial scales. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Functional characters have the potential to act as indicators of species turnover between local communities. Null models provide a powerful statistical approach to test for patterns using functional character information. A combined null model/functional character approach provides the ability to distinguish between the effect of competition and environmental filtering on species turnover. We measured 13 functional characters relating directly to resource use for the fish species found in French lakes. We combined this functional character data with a null model approach to test whether co-occurring species overlapped more or less than expected at random for four primary niche axes. We used an environmentally constrained null model approach to determine if the same mechanisms were responsible for species turnover at different sections of the altitudinal gradient. Functional diversity indices were used to examine the variation in functional character diversity with altitude, as a test of the hypothesis that competitive intensity decreases with increasing environmental adversity. The unconstrained null model showed that environmental filtering was the dominant influence on species turnover between lakes. In the constrained null model, there was much less evidence for environmental filtering, emphasising the strong effect of altitude on turnover in functional character values between local communities. Different results were obtained for low-altitude and high-altitude lake subsets, with more evidence for the effect of environmental filtering being found in the high-altitude lakes. This demonstrates that different processes may influence species turnover throughout an environmental gradient. Functional diversity values showed a slight decrease with altitude, indicating that there was only weak evidence that competitive intensity decreased with increasing altitude. Variation resource availability and environmental stress probably cause the observed turnover in functional characters along the altitudinal gradient, though the effects of dispersal limitation and species introductions in high-altitude lakes cannot be ruled out.

AB We asked whether species richness or species identity contributed more to ecosystem function in a trait-based functional group, burrowing, filter-feeding bivalves (freshwater mussels: Unionidae), and whether their importance changed with environmental context and species composition. We conducted a manipulative experiment in a small river examining the effects of mussel assemblages varying from one to eight species on benthic algal standing crop across two sets of environmental conditions: extremely low discharge and high water temperature (summer); and moderate discharge and water temperature (fall). We found strong species identity effects within this guild, with one species (Actinonaias ligamentina) influencing accrual of benthic algae more than other species, but only under summer conditions. We suspect that this effect is due to a combination of the greater biomass of this species and its higher metabolic and excretion rates at warm Summer temperatures, resulting in increased nitrogen subsidies to benthic algae. We also found that Actinonaias influenced the condition of other mussel species, likely through higher consumption, interference, or both. This study demonstrates that species within trait-based functional groups do not necessarily have the same effects on ecosystem properties, particularly under different environmental conditions.

AB 1. This study investigated the relation of benthic macroinvertebrates to environmental gradients in Central European lowland rivers. Taxonomic structure (taxa) and functional composition (metrics) were related to gradients at four different spatial scales (ecoregion, catchment, reach and site). The environmental variables at the catchment-, reach- and site scales reflected the intensity of human impact: catchment and floodplain land use, riparian and floodplain degradation, flow regulation and river bank and bed modification.
   2. Field surveys and GIS yielded 130 parameters characterising the hydromorphology and land use of 75 river sections in Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland. Two hundred and forty-four macroinvertebrate taxa and 84 derived community metrics and biotic indices such as functional guilds, diversity and composition measures were included in the analysis.
   3. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Redundancy Analysis (RDA) showed that hydromorphological and land use variables explained 11.4%, 22.1% and 15.8% of the taxa variance at the catchment ('macro'), reach ('meso') and site ('micro') scales, respectively, compared with 14.9%, 33.2% and 21.5% of the variance associated with the derived metrics. Ecoregion and season accounted for 10.9% and 20.5% of the variance of the taxonomic structure and functional composition, respectively.
   4. Partial CCA (pCCA) and RDA (pRDA) showed that the unique variance explained was slightly higher for taxa than for metrics. By contrast, the joint variance explained for metrics was much higher at all spatial scales and largest at the reach scale. Environmental variables explained 46.8% of metric variance and 32.4% of taxonomic structure.
   5. Canonical Correspondence Analysis and RDA identified clear environmental gradients along the two main ordination axes, namely, land use and hydromorphological degradation. The impact of catchment land use on benthic macroinvertebrates was mainly revealed by the proportion of urban areas. At the reach scale, riparian and floodplain attributes (bank fixation, riparian wooded vegetation, shading) and the proportion of large woody debris were strong predictors of the taxonomic structure and functional composition of benthic macroinvertebrates. At the site scale, artificial substrata indicated human impact, particularly the proportion of macro- and mesolithal used for bank enforcement (rip-rap).
   6. Our study revealed the importance of benthic macroinvertebrate functional measures (functional guilds, composition and abundance measures, sensitivity and tolerance measures, diversity measures) for detecting the impact of hydromorphological stress at different spatial scales.

AB 1. Resprouting is a key plant attribute facilitating persistence in disturbance-prone environments. Resprouting ability in seedlings may depend on both developmental ontogeny and seed size. However, the relationships between these factors are not well explored, especially for woody species with comparatively small seeds and epigeal germination.
   2. We investigated resprouting capacity in seedlings from four subtropical, riparian, Myrtaceous tree species, Melaleuca leucadendra, Asteromyrtus symphyocarpa, Eucalyptus camaldulensis var. obtusa and Tristaniopsis laurina, displaying these characteristics. We recorded resprouting in response to simulated disturbance as a function of seed mass and developmental age (5-150 days post-emergence) and examined the acquisition of resprouting ability in relation to growth and biomass allocation patterns.
   3. Patterns of resprouting were distinct among species, but the acquisition of resprouting ability was not determined by seed mass. The 'small' seeded M. leucadendra and the 'intermediate' seeded E. camaldulensis showed unexpectedly high shoot resprouting vigour from cotyledon stage (70% resprouting at 5 days post-emergence), as well as greatest ongoing allocation to root mass and lateral root development. In contrast, in A. symphyocarpa (another species with 'intermediate' seed mass) and T. laurina (a 'large' seeded species) resprouting rates during early development were much lower (< 10%), although there was a trend towards increasing resprouting ability with age in A. symphyocarpa (> 150 days). Resprouting capacity was also independent of seedling size and relative growth rate.
   4. Our results indicate that the size-dependency of resprouting capacity varies considerably among these species. This suggests physiological and morphological species traits other than those directly related to reserve size or relative growth rate may convey survivorship in river environments.
   5. Our findings show that resprouting capacity was not related to seed size and seedling growth patterns in these four species. This is different to evidence from comparative studies undertaken in fire-prone and other temperate environments. A broader survey of seedling resprouting ability including more species is required to determine the generality of our findings in riparian species.

AB The morphology of pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus populations from five Catalonian waterbodies (north-eastern Spain) that vary in hydromorphometry was examined and compared to a native North American reference site that contained two morphological variants of this species. Populations exhibited significant differences in fin location, body depth and caudal peduncle length, which are known to have functional significance in the hydrodynamics of swimming and hence the foraging mode. Differences were also noted in internal morphological traits functionally related to prey selection. Pumpkinseed populations that fed extensively on zooplankton showed narrow gill raker spacing, and mollusc-feeding populations had longer and wider pharyngeal bones. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) provided significant separation of all populations on the basis of both external and internal morphology, with the main axis of separation being geographical rather than environmental. The secondary DFA axis, however, did separate populations that fed primarily on zooplankton from those that were primarily benthic invertebrate feeders. In this regard, a population that occupied an Iberian steep-sided reservoir with an unstable littoral zone showed similar morphological adaptations to the limnetic morphological variant native in North America, supporting previous studies showing that fish morphology is strongly affected by prey type and feeding mode. The results suggest that pumpkinseeds are able to adapt, morphologically, to the types of habitats and prey present in Catalonian waterbodies, and this may partially explain why they are so successful in areas where they have been introduced.

AB The relation between functional traits and abundance of species has the potential to provide evidence on the mechanisms that structure local ecological communities. The niche-limitation/limiting-similarity hypothesis, derived from MacArthur and Levins' original concept, predicts that species that are similar to others in terms of functional traits will suffer greater competition and hence be less abundant. On the other hand, the environment-filtering/ habitat-optimum hypothesis predicts that groups of species with functional traits that are close to the optimum for that environment, and are therefore similar to other species, will be more abundant. We propose a new niche-assembly model for predicting the relative abundance of species in communities from their functional traits, which can detect the patterns that would be expected from either of these hypotheses. The model was fitted to eight plant communities sampled in the Lake Ohau district of New Zealand. For seven of the sites, the patterns could not be distinguished from that expected under a null model. However, in one site there was highly significant departure from the null model in the direction expected from the niche-limitation hypothesis. The site was probably the most productive of those examined. It is possible that competition for light rather than belowground resources, or faster recovery from disturbance, allowed greater predictability. Surprisingly, the predictability was seen when just the presences of a species' neighbours in trait space were taken into account, but not when the potential effects of those neighbours were weighted by their abundance. For three of the four model types, the effects of species on each other were consistently negative: a significant trend. These results contradict the various neutral models of ecological communities.

ID MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; CONSUMPTION; MODEL; FISH
AB Food availability can strongly affect predator-prey dynamics. When change in habitat condition reduces the availability of one prey type, predators often search for other prey, perhaps in a different habitat. Interactions between behavioural and morphological traits of different prey may influence foraging success of visual predators through trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs), such as prey activity and body coloration. We tested the hypothesis that foraging success of stream-dwelling cutthroat trout (Onchorhyncus clarki) on cryptically coloured, less-active benthic prey (larval mayfly; Paraleptophebia sp.) can be enhanced by the presence of distinctly coloured, active prey (larval stonefly shredder; Despaxia augusta). Cutthroat trout preyed on benthic insects when drifting invertebrates were unavailable. When stonefly larvae were present, the trout ate most of the stoneflies and also consumed a higher proportion of mayflies than under mayfly only treatment. The putative mechanism is that active stonefly larvae supplied visual cues to the predator that alerted trout to the mayfly larvae. Foraging success of visual predators on cryptic prey can be enhanced by distinctly coloured, active benthic taxa through unidirectional facilitation to the predators, which is a functional change of interspecific interaction caused by a third species. This study suggests that prey-predator facilitation through TMIIs can modify species interactions, affecting community dynamics.

AB Based on morphological analyses, hippos have traditionally been classified as Suiformes, along with pigs and peccaries. However, molecular data indicate hippos and cetaceans are sister taxa (see review in Uhen, 2007, this issue). This study analyzes soft tissue characters of the pygmy hippo forelimb to elucidate the functional anatomy and evolutionary relationships of hippos within Artiodactyla. Two specimens from the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C. were dissected, revealing several adaptations to an aquatic lifestyle. However, these adaptations differ functionally from most aquatic mammals as hippos walk along river or lake bottoms, rather than swim. Several findings highlight a robust mechanism for propelling the trunk forward through the water. For example, mm. pectoralis superficialis and profundus demonstrate broad sites of origin, while the long flexor tendons serve each of the digits, reflecting the fact that all toes are weight-bearing. Pygmy hippos also have eight mm. interossei and a well-developed m. lumbricalis IV. Retention of intrinsic adductors functions to prevent splaying of the toes, an advantageous arrangement in an animal walking on muddy substrates. Published descriptions indicate common hippos share all of these features. Hippo and ruminant forelimbs share several traits; however, hippos are unique among artiodactyls in retaining several primitive muscles (e.g., mm. palmaris longus and flexor digitorum brevis). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that hippos diverged from other Artiodactyla early in the history of this group. Additional analyses of hindlimb and axial muscles may help determine whether this trajectory was closely allied to that of Cetacea.

AB 1. While studies of phytoplankton and terrestrial plant communities have increasingly emphasised the use of functional traits in ecological research, few have yet to apply this approach to zooplankton communities.
   2. This study reviews laboratory and observational studies on zooplankton feeding and life history and provides a series of functional trait tables for the North American freshwater zooplankton. Qualitative and quantitative trait tables highlight areas where data were more scarce and point to which types of studies could fill in gaps in our knowledge of zooplankton niches.
   3. Data were most complete for the Cladocera across most traits, while feeding information for cyclopoids was most sparse. Qualitative data that distinguished congeneric species were lacking for most groups.
   4. A regional community dendrogram for common north-eastern North American zooplankton species was generated and shows that taxonomic differences between species do not capture fully functional differences based on the traits of body length, habitat, trophic group and feeding type.
   5. The data collected here, combined with readily measurable species attributes, can be used to generate a multivariate measure of the functional niche of each species found in a community. Armed with this information, functional relationships that are useful for ecological studies of lake ecosystems can be more easily conducted.

AB 1. Focusing on the current environmental characteristics, the 'habitat template' theory proposes that life-history strategies summarise how evolution has shaped species to cope with the temporal and spatial variability of their present environment. The hierarchical 'landscape filters' concept predicts that the distribution of species reflects their specific traits that allow them to pass through multiple habitat filters. Together, these theories showed the importance of identifying the functional relationships of species to selective habitat forces in order to predict the organisation and response of communities to the environment.
   2. We test the relationships between life-history traits of European freshwater fish species' and their habitat preferences, to detect the strategies adopted by fish to cope with their current habitat. For this purpose, we use published data on species traits and habitat preferences (microhabitat hydraulics, temperature and oxygen level). We use multivariate analyses to classify fish species' strategies and test the relationships between strategies and habitat preferences.
   3. We identified a continuum of life-history patterns between two extremes, with opportunistic and periodic species. Our study supports the idea that microhabitat hydraulics plays a more important role as a template for these species ecological strategies than temperature and oxygen level. Indeed, riffle habitats may select opportunistic species whereas weak relationships are found between species strategies and both their temperature and oxygen level preferences. In addition, the ratio between mortality and growth rate (dimensionless trait), reflecting a trade-off between growth and survival, varied among species according to the use of their hydraulic habitat, with species using deep habitats exhibiting the highest values.
   4. These general relationships between hydraulics and traits may be of importance in community ecology to develop predictive models to understand how fish communities change with the hydraulic environment.

AB We assessed species-specific coverage (km(2)) of a submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) community in the fresh and upper oligohaline Potomac Estuary from 1985 to 2001 using a method combining field observations of species-proportional coverage data with congruent remotely sensed coverage and density (percent canopy cover) data. Biomass (estimated by density-weighted coverage) of individual species was calculated. Under improving water quality conditions, exotic SAV species did not displace native SAV; rather, the percent of natives increased over time. While coverage-based diversity did fluctuate and increased, richness-based community turnover rates were not significantly different from zero. SAV diversity was negatively related to nitrogen concentration. Differences in functional traits, such as reproductive potential, between the dominant native and exotic species may explain some interannual patterns in SAV. Biomass of native, as well as exotic, SAV species varied with factors affecting water column light attenuation. We also show a positive response by a higher trophic level, waterfowl, to SAV communities dominated by exotic SAV from 1959 to 2001.

AB We examined the community-environment relationships of lotic macroinvertebrates in near-pristine headwater streams, and the correlation between patterns in taxonomic and functional structure at two regional extents. The across-ecoregion scale comprised five ecoregions spanning all of Finland, while the within-ecoregion scale comprised of north boreal and middle boreal ecoregions. We expected that taxonomic structure should exhibit stronger relationships than functional structure to spatial gradients, while the reverse should be true for local environmental factors. We found some support for this notion, because spatial variables were marginally more important for taxonomic than functional structure. Furthermore, within the two ecoregions, local environmental variables were slightly more important for functional than taxonomic structure. Geographical location (i.e. spatial variables) was more influential at the across-ecoregions extent than within the two ecoregions. Largely the same local environmental variables accounted for variation in both taxonomic and functional structure, including water pH, nutrients, colour, and stream size. Similar responses to local environmental features likely contributed to the significant correlation between patterns in taxonomic and functional structure. It has been suggested that functional traits may be rather insensitive to natural variation, yet our functional categorization showed distinct variation along local environmental, catchment, and spatial gradients across near-pristine streams. Thus, natural ecological filters should be accounted for prior to the examination of the effects of anthropogenic filters on stream macroinvertebrate community composition.

AB Mandarin orchards under conventional and integrated production (IP) practices were surveyed in the area around the delta of the Ebro River (Spain). The floristic and functional structures were evaluated to compare weed communities and to determine the relationship between community structure, mandarin orchard characteristics and type of management. The alpha diversity observed was 12.3 (S.D. 5.84) and 18.0 (S.D. 5.50) for conventional and IP orchards, respectively, and gamma diversity was 77 for conventional and 96 for IP agricultural practices. Differences were found in overall inter-row vegetation cover (11.3% conventional, 90.4% IP). Analyses of variance and mean comparison tests revealed no differences in any of the functional traits considered between the two types of management. All the multivariate methods of analysis employed revealed that the weed community composition was related to the inter-row management system. Mowing orchard inter-rows led to a successional trajectory from typically agrestal weed communities to ruderal vegetation, giving rise to high richness and also high cover. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper summarises the outcomes of the 14th Workshop of the International Association of Phytoplankton Taxonomy and Ecology (IAP). The authors mostly addressed their contributions on the following topics: morphological and morpho-functional descriptors of phytoplankton, size and shape structure of phytoplankton related to different kinds of environmental variables and the role of morphological and physiological plasticity of phytoplankton in maintaining the (apparently) same populations under different environmental conditions. Case studies from different kinds of aquatic environments (deep and shallow lakes, reservoirs with different age, purpose and trophic state, floodplain wetlands mostly in the temperate region but also from subtropical and tropical ones) have shown that similar environmental forcing calls for similar morpho-functional properties even though the corresponding associations can be markedly different on species level.

AB The fundamental idea behind the study of biodiversity patterns is the presumed connection between the shape of species assemblages and the functional ways in which they are organized, this functional organization referring to how species are related to one another, as competitors or members of a web of interactions and to how species are facing similar environmental constraints. Amongst the different facets of biodiversity, functional diversity is certainly a key for ecosystem processes in coastal areas. However, surprisingly, patterns of functional diversity have received little attention until now. After presenting a common framework linking functional diversity patterns to species coexistence theories, the aim of our study was twofold: (1) to seek assembly rules in brackish lagoon fish communities drove by functional traits. To this aim we used null models to examine the influence of two opposing forces acting on community structure: interspecific competition that might prevent the coexistence of the most similar species, and environmental filters that might result in the most similar species to coexist. (2) To seek relationships between fish functional diversity and environmental gradients, if any. Fish sampling was carried out in two coastal lagoons where stations differ considerably in terms of physicochemical parameters. Using morphological functional traits, functional diversity of fish communities was estimated using two recently published indices as well as a new proposed index. Firstly our study was not able to demonstrate a limitation of similarity in coexisting lagoon fishes due to interspecific competition. Conversely our results support the niche filtering hypothesis preventing species too dissimilar from one another to co-occur at the same station. Secondly, salinity was positively related to the functional diversity of fishes in both lagoons suggesting that within species assemblages near the channel species are less redundant than at stations far from the channel where species tend to be functionally similar (benthic and eating zooplankton).

AB The River Continuum Concept (RCC) explains the structural and functional characteristics of stream communities focusing on the gradually changing physical components from headwaters to downstream habitats of streams and rivers. The global value of the RCC is still uncertain, possibly because physical factors (e.g., altitude and then temperature, stream order, channel width) can vary differently in longitudinal river axes across the world. Moreover, RCC predictions in relation to different physical factors have not been tested adequately in different biomes, especially biomes outside of temperate North America. Here, we report on the functional structure of macroinvertebrate communities in neotropical streams from Bolivia along a broad altitudinal gradient (from 1120 to 4300 m a.s.l.), aiming to understand how altitude can affect the longitudinal changes in functional feeding groups (FFG) and richness predicted by the RCC. The RCC predictions for functional structure were not completely matched when analyzing FFGs in relation to an index of longitudinal stream gradient. However, after removing the effect of altitude by using residuals from regressions between FFGs and altitude, FFG patterns matched RCC predictions more closely. We detected significant relationships between altitude and the relative abundance of collector-gatherers, shredders and scrapers which may be related to changes in temperature, UV radiation and canopy cover along the altitudinal gradient. Our results indicate that altitude combined with position along the longitudinal gradient is an important factor governing the FFG structure of macro invertebrate communities in neotropical streams.

AB Previously tested in temperate ecoregions, the River Habitat Templet concept provides a framework for relating the characteristics of species (i.e. traits indicating species ecological functions) to habitat attributes. As species traits are comparable among most faunal groups, they can be used to examine community patterns in ecological functions at a large spatial scale, even across areas that differ in the taxonomic composition of their communities. If local physical attributes produce similar trait patterns on a global scale, the River Habitat Templet can serve as a general predictive too] of community characteristics regardless of geographical zones. We studied eight biological traits in 82 neotropical taxa: i) food, ii) feeding habits, iii) respiration, iv) maximum body size, v) body flexibility, vi) body form, vii) specific adaptation to flow constraints and viii) mobility and attachment to substratum. A multivariate approach was used to examine taxonomic and functional (trait) differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages among study sites. Proportions of trait modalities were examined in relation to Froude number, substratum roughness and benthic organic matter availability at mesohabitat scale. Even if communities differed taxonomically, they were functionally similar. Thirty of 46 trait modalities of neotropical aquatic taxa were significantly related to at least one selected environmental attribute. The results clearly support the habitat templet as a major driver of macro invertebrate community structure in neotropical running waters. But the observed 'trait/ habitat' relationships did not sufficiently match those from temperate areas for us to confirm the existence of general rules organizing functional trait structure among benthic invertebrate communities that would be applicable in different climatic regions.

AB We examined long-term variability of the biological traits of benthic macroinvertebrate communities using data collected annually (20-, 7-, and 8-years in duration, respectively) from three study regions in northern California's mediterranean-climate region. We related temporal variability to several climatic and physical variables representing precipitation and hydrologic conditions, and assessed the stability of biological-trait composition using time-lag regression analysis. We also examined the temporal variability of trait diversity metrics and their relationship to taxa richness. Trait modalities exhibited high temporal variability (similar to 20 % of all trait modalities had a CV > 50 %) and biological-trait composition varied along a gradient from dry (extreme drought) to wet (above average) years. Traits conferring resistance or resilience to drying (e.g. desiccation resistance, aerial respiration) were more common in drought years, whereas traits conferring resistance or resilience to floods (e.g. flattened body shape, drift dispersal) were more common in wet years. Furthermore, prolonged drought and the patterns of increasing or decreasing precipitation over time in the study regions resulted in patterns of directional change in biological-trait composition. Although biological traits had high temporal variation within each region, between-region variation was higher than temporal variation in a single region. As found in other studies, trait diversity and richness metrics were relatively invariable over time despite high taxonomic turnover. However, there was considerable regional variation in trait diversity metrics along a gradient of increasing taxonomic diversity. The four functional metrics studied showed high redundancy. Taxa richness was positively correlated with three functional metrics (trait richness and two trait diversity measures), and trait richness and diversity became saturated taxa richness increased (similar to 50 taxa). In communities largely controlled by abiotic factors, such as stream invertebrates in mediterranean-climate, high redundancy may be the result of strong filtering of traits at larger spatial scales.

AB The biology and ecology of plant pathogenic bacteria have been studied almost exclusively in agricultural contexts. In contrast, for numerous human pathogens their biological activity in niches outside of medical contexts is well-known. Whereas there is increasing evidence that traits fostering survival in 'environmental' niches can be the basis for virulence factors of human pathogens, niches for plant pathogenic bacteria outside of plants or of agricultural settings have not been elucidated. Most phytopathogenic bacteria are not obligate parasites, some of them can be transported to altitudes of several kilometres, they are scrubbed from the atmosphere by rainfall, and thus they are presumably transported to and might survive in a wide range of habitats. We isolated Pseudomonas syringae from river epilithon (rock-attached biofilms composed of algae, diatoms, rotifers, bacteria and nematodes) at densities up to 6000 cells g(-1) in France and the USA, some in pristine settings where waters flowed directly from snow melt and had not passed through agricultural zones. These strains induced hypersensitivity in indicator plants (tobacco) suggesting the presence of functional pathogenicity systems, and many induced disease in 1-7 of the plant species tested and produced a syringomycin-like toxin. Strains also were resistant to some antibiotics used to control plant diseases but not to copper sulphate. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA of epilithon strains and of reference strains of R syringae revealed that a genetic lineage containing the strains with the broadest host range was distributed across several continents. Is it likely that wide spread dissemination of P. syringae occurs via aerosols and precipitation. This work highlights our limited understanding of non-agricultural niches in the ecology and evolution of plant pathogenic bacteria, of their role in the development of agricultural epidemics both as sources of inoculum and as sources of novel traits that may enhance bacterial pathogenicity and fitness.

AB The lugworm Arenicola marina was excluded from sandy sediment areas in the mid and low intertidal zone of the Wadden Sea. Exclusion, control and ambient plots were 400 m(2) each, replicated six times and sampled in August of three consecutive years. Responses were analysed with respect to functional trait groups in the associated polychaete assemblage using uni- and multivariate statistical techniques. Tube-building worms and predacious worms were most abundant in exclusion plots, while subsurface deposit feeders tended to dominate in the presence of lugworms. Lugworm effects were stronger in low intertidal fine sand than in mid intertidal medium sand. In the third year, lugworm densities strongly decreased at the study site. Nevertheless the polychaete functional group composition in lugworm exclusion plots still significantly differed from that in control and ambient plots. We assume that the permanent exclusion of lugworms may have entailed a cumulative change in sediment properties in the exclusion plots. Overall, lugworm effects were highly dependent on space and time as well as on differential recruitment success in this intertidal polychaete assemblage. Sediment-mediated effects of an ecosystem engineer on associated species appear to be subtle and contingent in variable environments. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Trawling disturbs benthic communities, eliminating the most vulnerable organisms and modifying habitat structure. While the cumulative effects of disturbance resulting from commercial trawling activities are poorly understood, several studies suggest that chronically disturbed communities are dominated by opportunistic organisms. This study focuses on changes in functional components of the benthic community occurring in muddy sediments in a NW Mediterranean trawling ground, including an area that has not been fished for 20 yr. In both disturbed and undisturbed areas, the overall benthic community from the fishing ground was dominated by burrowing epifaunal deposit feeders and predators, and deep burrowing infaunal deposit feeders. The fished area had a higher abundance of burrowing epifaunal scavengers and motile burrowing infauna, while the undisturbed area was characterised by higher abundance of surface infauna, epifaunal suspension feeders and predatory fish. This study clearly demonstrates that changes in the functional components of a benthic community can result from fishing in areas dominated by organisms not considered especially vulnerable to trawling activities. Thus, fisheries managers aiming to reduce ecosystem disturbance must consider the implications of trawling on the structure and functioning of all types of benthic communities.

AB Fauna have been found to regulate important biogeochemical properties and ecosystem functions in benthic environments. In this study, we focused on how functional biodiversity and species-specific traits of benthic macrofauna affect key ecosystem functions related to organic matter mineralization and cycling of nutrients in surface sediments. Dominant benthic invertebrates from the Baltic Sea and the Skagerrak were classified into functional groups in accordance with their behaviour, feeding and sediment reworking activities. Macrofauna species were added in different combinations to defaunated Baltic sediments in 2 parallel microcosm systems fuelled with brackish and marine water. In total, there were 12 treatments that differed in terms of functional diversity of benthic fauna. The experiments demonstrated that faunal activities directly affected benthic oxygen and nutrient fluxes, sediment reactivity and pore-water distribution under both Baltic and Skagerrak conditions. Benthic fluxes, sediment reactivity and pore-water distribution were similar in Baltic and Skagerrak treatments, in which the same functional biodiversity and species-specific traits of benthic macrofauna were observed. Although no significant effects of functional biodiversity could be detected under Baltic or Skagerrak conditions, treatments with bioturbating fauna from the Skagerrak enhanced oxygen consumption and nutrient fluxes compared to treatments with Baltic fauna and Skagerrak fauna with functional groups similar (parallel) to the Baltic fauna. Moreover, speciesspecific traits related to the Skagerrak fauna (e.g. the thalassinid shrimp Calocarls macandreae) exceeded the effects of all other faunal treatments. This suggests that species-specific traits of macrofauna may override species richness and functional biodiversity of macrofauna when regulating important ecosystem properties and functions in benthic environments.

AB In the past two decades, much direct evidence has been gathered on active crawling by stalked crinoids, a group generally thought to be sessile. Detailed descriptions of crawling mechanics of isocrinids in aquaria revealed only exceedingly slow movements (similar to 0.1 mm sec(-1)). Crawling at such speeds severely restricted the range of roles that this behavior could play in stalked crinoid biology and, consequently, in its potential impact on their ecology and evolutionary history. Here, we provide evidence collected in situ by submersible near Grand Bahama Island at a depth of 420 m for a different mode of crawling in stalked crinoids. Its most striking feature is a speed two orders of magnitude greater (similar to 10-30 mm sec(-1)) than previously observed. The biomechanical cause for the differences in speeds between the two crawling modes is related to the difference in the number of articulations, and thus length of the arm, involved in the power stroke. We suggest that the high speed mode may represent an escape strategy from benthic enemies such as cidaroid echinoids, which occur with stalked crinoids and have been shown to ingest them. A first-order tally of crinoid genera possessing morphological traits required for crawling is provided. Crawling may have characterized some Paleozoic taxa, such as some of the advanced cladids (a group very closely related to post-Paleozoic crinoids), but the Permo-Triassic extinction represents a major threshold between the largely sessile crinoid faunas of the Paleozoic and the increasingly dominant motile crinoids of the post-Paleozoic.

AB The use of species traits to characterize the functional composition of benthic invertebrate communities has become well established in the ecological literature. This approach holds much potential for predicting changes of both species and species assemblages along environmental gradients in terms of traits that are sensitive to local environmental conditions. Further, in the burgeoning field of biomonitoring, a functional approach provides a predictive basis for understanding community-level responses along gradients of environmental alteration caused by humans. Despite much progress in recent years, the full potential of the functional traits-based approach is currently limited by several factors, both conceptual and methodological. Most notably, we lack adequate understanding of how individual traits are intercorrelated and how this lack of independence among traits reflects phylogenetic (evolutionary) constraint. A better understanding is needed if we are to make the transition from a largely univariate approach that considers single-trait responses along single environmental gradients to a multivariate one that more realistically accounts for the responses of many traits across multiple environmental gradients characteristic of most human-dominated landscapes. Our primary objective in this paper is to explore the issue of inter-trait correlations for lotic insects and to identify opportunities and challenges for advancing the theory and application of traits-based approaches in stream community ecology. We created a new database on species-trait composition of North American lotic insects. Using published accounts and expert opinion, we collected information on 20 species traits (in 59 trait states) that fell into 4 broad categories: life-history morphological, mobility, and ecological. First, we demonstrate the importance of considering how the linkage of specific trait states within a taxon is critical to developing a more-robust traits-based community ecology. Second, we examine the statistical correlations among traits and trait states for the 311 taxa to identify trait syndromes and specify which traits provide unique (uncorrelated) information that can be used to guide trait selection in ecological studies. Third, we examine the evolutionary associations among traits by mapping trait states onto a phylogentic tree derived from morphological and molecular analyses and classifications from the literature. We examine the evolutionary lability of individual traits by assessing the extent to which they are unconstrained by phylogenic relationships across the taxa. By focusing on the lability of traits within lotic genera of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, taxa often used as water-quality indicators, we show how a traits-based approach can allow a priori expectations of the differential response of these taxa to specific environmental gradients. We conclude with some ideas about how specific trait linkages, statistical correlations among traits, and evolutionary lability of traits can be used in combination with a mechanistic understanding of trait response along environmental gradients to select robust traits useful for a more predictive community ecology. We indicate how these new insights can direct the research in statistical modeling that is necessary to achieve the full potential of models that can predict how multiple traits will respond along multiple environmental gradients.

AB This study examines the molecular-genetic divergence and evolution of Australian aquatic micro-Crustacea Daphnia and Daphniopsis. The results indicate that species of Daphniopsis are accommodated within the genus Daphnia. Although their phyletic integrity is no longer supported, all Daphniopsis species (save one from North America) form a monophyletic group and may warrant subgeneric recognition pending further systematic investigations. A total of five lineages are shown to occupy Australian inland waters, including an endemic subgenus (Australodaphnia) and representatives of the subgenus Ctenodaphnia. The subgenera (Daphnia and Hyalodaphnia) that dominate the North American fauna are absent in Australia. The large extent of sequence divergence among major groups suggests that continental isolation has helped shape the early evolution of daphniids. More recent speciation is also evident, particularly by the Daphnia carinata species complex, whose numbers have grown to 13 members by the addition of a species previously assigned to the nominal subgenus and species yet to be formally described. The molecular data provide more evidence that the colonization of distinct habitats and ecological settings is a key factor in spurring diversification in the genus, while also modulating the pace of molecular evolution. This study attributes habitat-specific molecular clocks to the intense ultraviolet (UV) exposure in both saline and transparent oligohaline waters. Adaptations to these harsh environments by at least four independent lineages include the convergent acquisition of a melanic carapace. Yet some lineages, clearly under mutational duress, lack this commonly acquired protective trait. There are numerous adaptive lines of defense against UV damage, including the complex regulatory mechanisms required to initiate a cellular response to guard and repair DNA. Functional molecular studies may soon challenge a notion built on morphology that convergence is the general directive to Daphnia's ecological and evolutionary success.

AB The response of ecological communities to anthropogenic disturbance is of both scientific and practical interest. Communities where all species respond to disturbance in a similar fashion ( synchrony) will exhibit large fluctuations in total biomass and dramatic changes in ecosystem function. Communities where some species increase in abundance while others decrease after disturbance ( compensation) can maintain total biomass and ecosystem function in the face of anthropogenic change. We examined dynamics of the Little Rock Lake ( Wisconsin, USA) zooplankton community in the context of an experimental pH manipulation conducted in one basin of the lake. A novel application of wavelets was used to partition patterns of synchrony and compensation by time scale. We find interestingly that some time series show both patterns of synchrony and compensation depending on the scale of analysis. Within the unmanipulated basin, we found subtle patterns of synchrony and compensation within the community, largely at a one-year time scale corresponding to seasonal variation. Within the acidified lake basin, dynamics shifted to longer time scales corresponding to the pattern of pH manipulation. Comparisons between pairs of species in different functional groups showed both strong compensatory and synchronous responses to disturbance. The strongest compensatory signal was observed for two species of Daphnia whose life history traits lead to synchrony at annual time scales, but whose differential sensitivity to acidification led to compensation at multiannual time scales. The separation of time scales inherent in the wavelet method greatly facilitated interpretation as patterns resulting from seasonal drivers could be separated from patterns driven by pH manipulation.

AB Sexually selected traits have been intensively studied in the recent past, but there is comparatively little information about the signalling value of the extended phenotype, despite its unique potential in mate choice and intersexual competition. Individuals manipulating their environment to create a nonbodily ornament may reveal their immediate quality more reliably than by using conventional signals. Nonbodily ornaments may also integrate a bearer's behaviour over a recent interval, which would save the potential receiver repeated or prolonged sampling of the signaller's behaviour. We investigated factors involved in the production of a nonbodily ornament and assessed its potential as a signal in the reproductive context. The crater-building behaviour of the Lake Tanganyika cichlid Cyathopharynx furcifer was observed and manipulated in the field and laboratory. Craters were maintained for prolonged Periods, and crater size correlated with male body size, building behaviour and crater location in the lek. Larger craters had a higher 'neatness index', and this index correlated negatively with a male condition factor. Behaviour of cichlids after a storm and our manipulations of crater size showed that crater size is a repeatable, individual character; destroyed craters were rebuilt to their original sizes roughly within I day and both, experimentally enlarged and diminished craters were immediately reconstructed to their original sizes. We conclude that mating craters are an individually characteristic, extended phenotype of the building males and potentially a suitable signal for conspecifics, providing information about the owner's size, capability and condition.

AB Terrestrial ecosystems originate when particular plant species attain dominance at specific locations under specific environmental regimes. Ecosystems terminate, gradually or abruptly, when the dominant species or functional types are replaced by others, usually owing to environmental change or severe and irreversible disturbance. Assessing whether current ecosystems are sustainable in the face of future environmental change can be aided by examining the range of environmental variation those ecosystems have experienced in the past, and by determining the environmental conditions under which those ecosystems arose. The range of environmental variation depends on the time scale at which it is assessed. A narrow time span (e.g. 200-300 years) may underestimate the range of variation within which an ecosystem is sustainable, and it may also underestimate the risk of major transformation or disruption of that ecosystem by environmental change. Longer time spans (e.g. 1000-2000 years) increase the range of variation, by encompassing a larger sample of natural variability as well as non-stationary variability in the earth system. Most modem ecosystems disappear when the time span is expanded to 10000-15 000 years owing to secular changes in earth's climate system. Paleo-ecological records can pinpoint the time of origination of specific ecosystems, and paleo-environ mental records can reveal the specific environmental changes that led to development of those ecosystems and the range of environmental variation under which those ecosystems have maintained themselves in the past. This information can help identify critical environmental thresholds beyond which specific modem ecosystems can no longer be sustained.

AB Aspects of connectivity and continuity operating in the River Meuse were analysed for their contribution to the biodiversity of the floodplain. From this analysis of the diversity and composition of the meadow communities, we aimed to derive effective biodiversity conservation strategies.
   The River Meuse is one of the larger rivers in the European Western Plains ecoregion. The alluvial plains of the river have a long history of cultivation, and for these plains the floodplain meadow vegetation is a highly appreciated and valuable nature conservation asset.
   We sampled floodplain meadows from 400 km of the six geomorphic reaches of the middle to lower course of the River Meuse. For each, 50 vascular plant releves were recorded, representing the spectrum of floodplain meadow communities of that reach. Beta diversity was calculated to quantify similarity in species pools between the reaches. A dissimilarity formula was used to determine the turnover between the reaches, and these dissimilarities were compared with a Mantel test to detect whether species composition of the floodplain meadows exhibited connectivity and continuity between the reaches. Species richness for the floodplain vegetation data of the reaches was compared with data for riparian invertebrate communities. The vegetation data sets were ordinated using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) to reveal patterns in the floodplain meadow species composition, and the DCA axes were related to plant functional groups and population strategies. The axis scores of the species and plots were linked to river and plant species traits.
   We did not observe an overall continuity trend in similarity, nor one in diversity in a downstream direction. Lateral connectivity was highlighted by the dissimilarity between the reaches and in the influxes of species from adjacent ecoregions. The DCA ordination showed statistically significant separations between reaches and between the plant functional groups. The second DCA axis related to the longitudinal gradient of the river, whereas the first axis showed stronger correlations with river and plant species traits. We termed this axis the 'disorder axis'. Plant invaders and avoiders are located at the left side of the disorder axis, whereas the true river-adapted categories of resisters and endurers are at the right extremity. Contributions to the disorder were identified in terms of connectivity with adjacent ecoregions and the physical disturbance regime of natural and anthropogenic perturbations, resulting in community changes between the reaches.
   We concluded that a single overall strategy for biodiversity conservation of the river or its floodplains is not feasible. Strategies can, however, be derived for separate river reaches based on functional groups in the communities, the disorder characteristics of the reach, and the influence of surrounding ecoregions.

AB While evolutionary trends have long received much attention and have been widely disputed, new methods are now allowing the testing of directional hypotheses with increased rigor. Here, we test a general hypothesis about the way many kinds of discrete characters are thought to evolve, termed oligomerization. This is the tendency for serial structures (such as arthropod body and appendage segments) or armature (such as spines) to evolve primarily through loss and fusion. Focusing on the Crustacea, we use maximum likelihood methods to test for directional evolution in a large sample (> 500) of discrete traits, analyzed against molecular-based phylogenies. We find evidence for a significant trend toward trait loss, in accordance with the reduction principle. However, this trend is far from ubiquitous, with many characters exhibiting a reconstructed bias toward gains. These results suggest that caution must be used before drawing conclusions about which taxa are "primitive" or about the directionality of morphological shifts in the absence of phylogenetic analysis. Nevertheless, oligomerization-as a trend rather than a law-may be an important process that influences evolutionary trajectories from both morphological and functional perspectives.

AB The Chaudanne stream received urban inputs discharged through combined sewer overflows (CSOs). The water quality was not severely impaired, with pollution mainly of organic origin. Oligochaete assemblages were studied in the coarse surface sediments and the hyporheic zone and sampled at four sites on seven occasions during 2000 and 2001. The seasonal distribution of oligochaete assemblages was analyzed by a PCA, the oligochaete species being assigned to functional traits (FTrs). Site 1, located upstream of the CSOs, was characterized by FTrs 1 and 2 (species indicating permeability and those intolerant to water pollution). Below the CSOs, high densities of oligochaetes occurred in the benthic layer of sites 3 and 4, with a predominance of FTr3 (species with tolerance to water pollution). At site 4, FTr4 species (indicative of sludge conditions) constantly predominated in the hyporheic system, but predominated in the benthos only during low stream discharges associated with peaks in CSOs. FTr3 was related to amounts of the oxidized forms of nitrogen, high stream discharges and probably to groundwater upwellings and the sludge tolerant species group (FTr4) was associated with high NH4+ contents. We are now testing the relevance and generalization of this new approach.

AB Questions: Do plant characteristics predict microsite colonization in severe habitats dominated by abiotic factors? Specifically, does colonization of microsites differ among shrubs, forbs and grasses or between wind- and water-dispersed plants, non-native and native plants, or N-fixing and non-N-fixing plants?
   Location: Kowhai River floodplain, Kaikoura, South Island, New Zealand.
   Methods: Five microsite characteristics were measured for > 1000 individuals representing 27 colonizing plant species on a two-year old surface of a primary succession on a New Zealand floodplain. The microsite characteristics included surface contour (convex, concave, or flat), the position of the plant (e.g., upstream, downstream) relative to the closest rock with > 20 cm maximum dimension, the distance to that same rock, the depth of the base of the stem below the surface of a plane resting on the adjacent microrelief, and soil particle size (gravel, pebbles or sand).
   Results: All plants preferred concave microsites near large rocks relative to systematically placed null points. We found no clear preferences for microhabitats by dispersal mode, native vs. non-native status, or plants with or without nitrogen-fixing symbionts, but grasses preferentially colonized fine soil particles. Highly variable responses among species contributed to these results. Better predictability of microsite preference was obtained for individual species than for plants grouped by characteristics.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that in severe habitats with strong abiotic filters and low microsite availability, such as found in early primary succession, coarse categories of species characteristics are poor predictors of colonization success.

AB 1. Glacier-fed streams are characterised by low spatial but high temporal heterogeneity, manifested in seasonal and diurnal discharge and suspended sediment peaks induced by glacial runoff. These streams shelter macroinvertebrate communities adapted to such harsh environmental conditions. Studies relating macroinvertebrate traits to environmental conditions in glacial streams could provide important insights into the structure and function of glacial stream communities.
   2. From data collected in three glacial streams from the central Swiss and southern French Alps, we analysed the relationships among six biological traits to define five groups of macroinvertebrate taxa with similar suites of traits.
   3. The longitudinal distribution of the five groups and of individual traits was analysed, as well as their variation according to a glaciality index combining water temperature, conductivity, suspended solids and substrate stability.
   4. The trait diversity along the three streams showed a strong upstream-downstream gradient. The upper reaches were dominated by a single group of taxa characterised by small, crawling, deposit feeders. The other trait-based groups appeared progressively downstream.
   5. Changes in the relative frequency of trait-based groups along the glaciality gradient highlighted the dominance of all-rounder resistant/resilient traits in the three streams and confirmed that environmental conditions in the glacial streams are too harsh or uniform to allow macroinvertebrate communities to develop alternative suites of traits. The findings are discussed in relation to the question of trait coding in the available literature.

AB Inshore waters of European coasts have accumulated a high share of non-indigenous species, where a changeable palaeoenvironment has caused low diversity in indigenous biota. Also strongly transformed modern coastal ecosystems seem to assimilate whatever species have been introduced and tolerate the physical regime. Adding non-native species does not have any directional predetermined effects on recipient coastal ecosystems. The status of being a non-native rather refers to a position in evolutionary history than qualify as an ecological category with distinct and consistent properties. Effects of invaders vary between habitats and with the phase of invasion and also with shifting ambient conditions. Although aliens accelerate change in European coastal biota, we found no evidence that they generally impair biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. More often, invaders expand ecosystem functioning by adding new ecological traits, intensifying existing ones and increasing functional redundancy.

AB The effects of variability in environmental conditions on species composition in benthic ecosystems are well established, but relatively little is known about how environmental variability relates to ecosystem functioning. Benthic invertebrate assemblages are heavily involved in the maintenance of ecological processes and investigation of the biological characteristics (traits) expressed in these assemblages can provide information about some aspects of functioning. The aim of this study was to establish and explore relationships between environmental variability and biological traits expressed in megafauna assemblages in two UK regions. Patterns of trait composition were matched to environmental conditions and subsets of variables best describing these patterns determined. The nature of the relationships were subsequently examined at two separate scales, both between and within the regions studied. Over the whole area, some traits related to size, longevity reproduction, mobility flexibility, feeding method, sociability and living habit were negatively correlated with salinity, sea surface temperature, annual temperature range and the level of fishing effort, and positively associated with fish taxon richness and shell content of the substratum. Between the two regions, reductions in temperature range and shell content were associated with infrequent relative occurrences of short-lived, moderately mobile, flexible, solitary, opportunistic, permanent-burrow dwelling fauna and those exhibiting reproductive strategies based on benthic development. Relationships between some traits and environmental conditions diverged within the two regions, with increases in fishing effort and shell content of the substratum being associated with low frequencies of occurrence of moderately mobile and moderately to highly flexible fauna within one region, but high frequencies in the other. These changes in trait composition have implications for ecosystem processes, with, for example, reductions in permanent-burrow dwellers within one of the regions potentially compromising the ability of the assemblages to process and store chemicals and waste products. However, the connections between environmental conditions and trait composition are complex and incorporate many factors. Experimental investigations will be necessary to determine the extent and consequences of these important relationships. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Studies documenting phenotypic variation among populations show that ecological performance in one activity is sometimes traded off against another. Identifying environment-specific costs and benefits associated with performance trade-offs is fundamental to knowing how conflicting selection pressures shape phenotype-environment matching in populations. We Studied phenotypic variation in shell armature (spininess) of the New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray), and explored how this variability relates to performance trade-offs between flow resistance and predator deterrence. Smooth- and spiny-shell morphotypes exist in populations in New Zealand streams and lakes, but the patterns and correlates of spatial variation of these phenotypes, and the possible hydrodynamical constraints and antipredatory benefits associated with spiny shell armature, are unknown. Samples from I I rivers and nine lakes on the South Island showed that, on average, nearly 70% of snails in streams were smooth-shelled, whereas > 80% of snails in lakes were spiny, suggesting dissimilar selective pressures between habitats. A laboratory flume experiment revealed that spines collected seston (i.e., suspended algae) at current speeds < 40 cm/s, making spiny morphs more prone to flow-induced dislodgment than smooth morphs. However, a fish feeding experiment showed that one benefit of spines on shells was a decrease in predation risk from the common bully (Gobiomorphus cotidianus), a widespread predator of mudsnails in both streams and lakes. All snails egested by bullies were dead, further Suggesting that these fishes may exert strong lethal effects on mudsnail populations in nature. Spine expression in lakes also appeared to be temperature related. We conclude that functional trade-offs between risk of flow-induced dislodgment and risk of fish predation affect shell armature frequencies of Potamopyrgus in freshwater habitats.

AB We conducted a microcosm experiment with monocultures and all possible combinations of four aquatic hyphomycete species, Articulospora tetracladia, Flagellospora curta, Geniculospora grandis and Heliscus submersus, to examine the potential effects of species richness on three functional aspects: leaf litter decomposition (leaf mass loss), fungal production (ergosterol buildup) and reproductive effort (released spores). Both species richness and identity significantly affected fungal biomass and conidial production (number and biomass of released spores), whereas only species identity had a significant effect on leaf mass loss. In mixed cultures, all measures of fungal functions were greater than expected from the weighted performances of participating species in monoculture. Mixed cultures outperformed the most active monoculture for biomass accumulation but not for leaf mass loss and conidial production. The three examined aspects of aquatic hyphomycete activity tended to increase with species richness, and a complementary effect was unequivocally demonstrated for fungal biomass. Our results also suggest that specific traits of certain species may have a greater influence on ecosystem functioning than species number.

AB Aim To examine the geographical patterns of the interception of photosynthetically active radiation by vegetation and to describe its spatial heterogeneity through the definition of ecosystem functional types (EFTs) based on the annual dynamics of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a spectral index related to carbon gains.
   Location The Iberian Peninsula.
   Methods EFTs were derived from three attributes of the NDVI obtained from NOAA/AVHRR sensors: the annual integral (NDVI-I), as a surrogate of primary production, an integrative indicator of ecosystem functioning; and the intra-annual relative range (RREL) and month of maximum NDVI (MMAX), which represent key features of seasonality.
   Results NDVI-I decreased south-eastwards. The highest values were observed in the Eurosiberian Region and in the highest Mediterranean ranges. Low values occurred in inner plains, river basins and in the southeast. The Eurosiberian Region and Mediterranean mountains presented the lowest RREL, while Eurosiberian peaks, river basins, inner-agricultural plains, wetlands and the southeastern part of Iberia presented the highest. Eurosiberian ecosystems showed a summer maximum of NDVI, as did high mountains, wetlands and irrigated areas in the Mediterranean Region. Mediterranean mountains had autumn-early-winter maxima, while semi-arid zones, river basins and continental plains had spring maxima. Based on the behaviour in the functional traits, 49 EFTs were defined.
   Main conclusions The classification, based on only the NDVI dynamics, represents the spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem functioning by means of the interception of radiation by vegetation in the Iberian Peninsula. The patterns of the NDVI attributes may be used as a reference in evaluating the impacts of environmental changes. Iberia had a high spatial variability: except for biophysically impossible combinations (high NDVI-I and high seasonality), almost any pattern of seasonal dynamics of radiation interception was represented in the Peninsula. The approach used to define EFTs opens the possibility of monitoring and comparing ecosystem functioning through time.

AB Effective catchment management in the face of landuse alteration depends on our ability to quantify ecologically significant changes and to discriminate among varying levels of impact. We compared the efficiency of traditional structural indices of change (species composition) with functional measures based on species traits (including life-history, trophic, and morphological features) in an analysis of grassland streams along a gradient of agricultural development (ungrazed native tussock, grazed tussock, extensively grazed pasture, and intensive dairy and deer farming). Streams were categorized in relation to overall agricultural intensity, and separately in terms of increasing nutrient concentrations and fine sediments on the streambed. Only 5 of 60 individual species demonstrated a significant separation across the landuse gradient, whereas 14 of 53 trait categories did so. Traits associated with population resilience (short generation time, asexual reproduction) became more prevalent with more intense agricultural pressure, reflecting predicted increases in intensity and frequency of stream disturbance. We observed a shift away from a tendency to lay unattached eggs at the water surface of the stream, reflecting the increasing likelihood of smothering by sediment, as well as increases in highly flexible and streamlined body shapes. Principal components and correspondence analyses involving species or trait composition all were able to discriminate landuse practises, but more of the overall between-landuse variance was accounted for by trait composition than species composition. All biological measures (species or trait composition) were correlated with both nutrient concentrations and sedimentation. Nutrient concentrations were better related to species and trait-category densities, whereas sedimentation was related to trait-category relative abundances. Overall, species traits successfully complemented traditional structural measures by helping to differentiate the consequences of landuse intensification in grassland stream communities. Rather than simply recording a loss or reduction of species, our functional approach was able to identify sensitive life-history characteristics linked to the functioning of ecosystems, thereby facilitating the development of targeted management actions.

AB Leaf litter is a major component in the organic matter budgets of streams worldwide. Shredding invertebrates are widely considered to be of central importance for the breakdown of allochthonous organic material in temperate-zone streams. However, various authors report an absence of this group in tropical streams. Various phenomena, including hydraulic disturbance, chemical leaf quality, and biotic control through macroconsumers, may cause variable shredder performance in streams. Our paper discusses the hypothesis that biogeographic distribution and the life-cycle strategies of the shredders are additional factors affecting the contribution of invertebrates to lotic decomposition processes. As a case study, we analyzed the type of organic matter inputs, the community of benthic invertebrate shredders, and the decomposition of temperate zone leaves (alder, Alnus glutinosa) in the Breitenbach (BRB), a temperate stream in Hesse, Germany, and in the Corrego Tenente Amaral (CTA), a neotropical Cerrado stream in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Quantities of natural leaf-litter inputs were comparable in the 2 systems (CTA: 820 g m(-2) y(-1), BRB: 700 g m(-2) y(-1)), but the diversity of trees varied from 60 species/ha in CTA to 5 in BRB. Several shredding species were found in CTA, but in very low abundances. Larvae of the shredding calamoceratid caddisfly Phylloicus sp. were found only in lateral pools and not in the stream channel at CTA. Earlier decomposition experiments with naturally fallen native leaves did not indicate any importance of shredders at CTA, but green leaves of A. glutinosa were rapidly consumed by mining chironomids (Stenochironomus sp.). Decomposition rates were faster in CTA (-k = 0.035 +/- 0.006) than in BRB during wintertime (0.0095 +/- 0.0021). We conclude that detritivorous neotropical insects may have 2 different species traits. Either they have mass occurrences during short periods when their food source is available and they must be adapted to a secondary, permanently available resource on which they can survive for the rest of the time (facultative specialists), or they are restricted to the few sites that provide a permanent food source (localized specialists). Apart from these special cases, however, the community in the neotropical stream was largely composed of omnivores.

AB Understanding the mechanisms by which normative species successfully invade new regions and the consequences for native fauna is a pressing ecological issue, and one for which niche theory can play an important role. In this paper, we quantify a comprehensive suite of morphological, behavioral, physiological, trophic, and life-history traits for the entire fish species pool in the Colorado River Basin to explore a number of hypotheses regarding linkages between human-induced environmental change, the creation and modification of ecological niche opportunities, and subsequent invasion and extirpation of species over the past 150 years. Specifically, we use the fish life-history model of. K. O. Winemiller and K. A. Rose to quantitatively evaluate how the rates of normative species spread and native species range contraction reflect the interplay between overlapping life-history strategies and an anthropogenically altered adaptive landscape. Our results reveal a number of intriguing findings. First, normative species are located throughout the adaptive surface defined by the life-history attributes, and they surround the ecological niche volume represented by the native fish species pool. Second, native species that show the greatest distributional declines are separated into those exhibiting strong life-history overlap with normative species (evidence for biotic interactions) and those having a periodic strategy that is not well adapted to present-day modified environmental conditions. Third, rapidly spreading normative fishes generally occupy "vacant" niche positions in life-history space, which is associated either with "niche opportunities" provided by human-created environmental conditions (consistent with the environmental-resistance hypothesis of invasion) or with minimal overlap with. native life-history strategies (consistent with the biotic-resistance hypothesis). This study is the first to identify specific life-history strategies that are associated with extensive range reduction of native species and expansion of normative species, and it highlights the utility of using niche and life-history perspectives to evaluate different mechanisms that contribute to the patterns of fish invasions and extirpations in the American Southwest.

AB Feeding strategies are typical traits reflecting the adaptation of species to environmental conditions. This concept is currently developed in some water quality systems (e.g. Index of Trophic completeness) and the structure of functional feeding groups (FFGs) could form part of a unified measure across communities differing in taxonomic composition. However, in South America, information about the FFG classification of invertebrates in streams is almost absent and existing studies using FFG structure follows classification from North America. But even taxonomically related species may have different diets in tropical and temperate areas and therefore, studies about FFG structure in neotropics could be biased. For this reason, we determined diet composition, trophic level and FFGs, using gut contents analysis and mouthpart observations of 49 macroinvertebrate taxa (mostly at genus level) from neotropical streams. We observed that practically all macroinvertebrates fed upon fine detritus which indicates the importance of this food resource in neotropical streams. As the assignment to a single FFG does not accurately reflect the functional profile of taxa, we transcribed the affinity of taxa to each FFG using fuzzy codes. Finally, we published the coding of diet composition and FFG of the taxa examined, which could be used in future community analyses of lotic ecosystems in the Neotropical zone.

AB Genetic diversity is recognized as an important population attribute for both conservation and evolutionary purposes; however, the functional relationships between the environment, genetic diversity, and fitness-related traits are poorly understood. We examined relationships between selected lake parameters and population genetic diversity measures in 46 walleye (Sander vitreus) populations across the province of Ontario, Canada, and then tested for relationships between six life history traits (in three categories: growth, reproductive investment, and mortality) that are closely related to fitness, and genetic diversity measures (heterozygosity, d(2), and Wright's inbreeding coefficient). Positive relationships were observed between lake surface area, growing degree days, number of species, and hatchery supplementation versus genetic diversity. Walleye early growth rate was the only life history trait significantly correlated with population heterozygosity in both males and females. The relationship between F-IS and male early growth rate was negative and significant (P < 0.01) and marginally nonsignificant for females (P = 0.06), consistent with inbreeding depression effects. Only one significant relationship was observed for d(2): female early growth rate (P < 0.05). Stepwise regression models showed that surface area and heterozygosity had a significant effect on female early growth rate, while hatchery supplementation, surface area and heterozygosity had a significant effect on male early growth rate. The strong relationship between lake parameters, such as surface area, and hatchery supplementation, versus genetic diversity suggests inbreeding and outbreeding in some of the populations; however, the weak relationships between genetic diversity and life history traits indicate that inbreeding and outbreeding depression are not yet seriously impacting Ontario walleye populations.

AB Currently, interest is growing in evaluating stream functional integrity while river assessment schemes are still exclusively based on structural indicators determined from various aquatic communities. Although some approaches relying on macroinvertebrate functional groups and combinations of traits have been advocated as means to assess ecosystem function, there has been no attempt to test the reliability of these methods with any direct functional indicator even though litter breakdown has been recently proposed as a functional indicator of stream impairment. The purpose of this study was to compare nine benthic macroinvertebrate-based structural metrics with functional metrics based on leaf litter breakdown in coarse and fine mesh bags in nine streams distributed along a eutrophication gradient. In coarse mesh bags, a 10-fold drop in breakdown rate of alder litter indicated a high sensitivity of this functional indicator to the deleterious effects of ammonium and its associated products, ammonia and nitrite. In contrast, microbial breakdown measured in fine mesh bags did not vary substantially along the gradient. Taxonomic and functional structures of macroinvertebrate assemblages were altered in the most eutrophic streams, as shown by drops in IBGN (French biotic index), BMWP (Britain biotic index) and EPTC (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Coleoptera) richness. Shredder richness and an ecological diversity index calculated from functional groups defined from multiple trait combinations exhibited the highest correlation with litter breakdown rate. Our results indicate that indirect assessment of stream functional integrity by structural indicators is realistic but requires specific metrics not necessarily based on traits or functional groups. Leaf litter breakdown is confirmed as a reliable indicator for direct assessment of streams impacted by eutrophication.

AB One of the best known plant disease outbreaks of all time was the Irish potato famine of 1845 to 1847 when the late blight pathogen. Phytophthora infestens, devastated the potato crop and caused more than one million deaths in Ireland. Potatoes are still plagued by disease but luckily most countries do not depend on potato as much as they did in Ireland in the 1800s. Producing disease-free potatoes, however, has come at a huge cost. To combat major diseases, such as late blight and common scab, 64 x 10(6) kg of pesticides are sprayed on potato fields each year. The costs associated with these measures are not only financial; environmental costs, although less easy to quantify, are significant and include negative impacts on natural ecosystems and the contamination of groundwater, lakes, and rivers. Our search for the "perfect" potato, i.e., one that has good processing qualities and disease resistance, has gained new momentum with the emergence of genomic technologies. Through functional genomics we will gain a better understanding of the genes responsible for tuber quality traits and those responsible for disease resistance. With a collection of desirable genes in mind, we can again use genomics as a diagnostic tool to search for these genes in the wide variety of potatoes around the world and to follow their transfer by classical breeding. This paper describes a research program currently underway in Canada that uses functional genomics to improve the potato.

AB The field of ecoinformatics is concerned with gaining a greater understanding of complex ecological systems. Many ecoinformatic tools, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), can shed important insights into the complexities of ecological data through pattern recognition and prediction; however, we argue that ecological knowledge has been used in a very limited fashion to shape the manner in which these approaches are applied. The present study provides a simple example of using ecological theory to better direct the use of neural networks to address a fundamental question in aquatic ecology-how are local stream macroinvertebrate communities structured by a hierarchy of environmental factors operating at multiple spatial scales? Using data for 195 sites in the western United States, we developed single-scale, multi-scale and hierarchical multi-scale neural networks relating EPT (Orders: Ephermeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) richness to environmental variables quantified at 3 spatial scales: entire watershed, valley bottom (100s-1000s m), and local stream reach (10s-100s m). Results showed that models based on multiple spatial scales greatly outperformed single-scale analyses (R=0.74 vs. R=0.51) and that a hierarchical ANN, which accounts for the fact that valley- and watershed-scale drivers influence local characteristics of the stream reach, provided greater insight into how environmental factors interact across nested spatial scales than did the non-hierarchical multi-scale model. Our analysis suggests that watershed drivers play a greater role in structuring local macroinvertebrate assemblages via their direct effects on local-scale habitats, whereas they play a much smaller indirect role through their influence on valley-scale characteristics. For the hierarchical model, the strongest predictors of EPT richness included descriptors of climate, land-use and hydrology at the watershed scale, land-use at the valley scale, and substrate characteristics and riparian cover at the reach scale. In summary, our results highlight the importance of incorporating environmental hierarchies to better understand and predict local patterns of macroinvertebrate assemblage structure in stream ecosystems. More generally, our case study serves to emphasize how incorporating prior ecological knowledge into ANN model structure can strengthen the relevance of ecoinformatic techniques for the broader scientific community.

AB There is now increasing acceptance that divergence of phenotypic traits, and the genetic structuring that underlie such divergence, can occur in sympatry. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of a sympatric polymorphism in the upper Forth catchment, Scotland, in a species for which high levels of phenotypic variation have been reported previously, the Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus. Attempting to determine the proximate mechanisms through which this pattern of phenotypic variation is maintained, we examine the use of the available feeding resource and the genotypic and phenotypic structure of charr in this system. We show clear differences in head morphology between charr from three very closely connected lakes with no barrier to movement (Lochs Doine, Voil and Lubnaig) and also differences in muscle stable isotope signatures and in stomach contents. There were significant differences at 6 microsatelite loci (between Lubnaig and the other two lochs) and very low estimates of effective migration between populations. We conclude that, despite living in effective sympatry, strong genetic and phenotypic sub-structuring is likely maintained by very high levels of site fidelity, especially during spawning, resulting in functional allopatric divergence of phenotype.

AB Feeding plasticity of the Andean plecopteran Klapopteryx kuscheli and Notoperla archiplatae larvae was assessed through a field experiment using enclosures. K. kuscheli has previously been described as a shredder and N. archiplatae as a scraper. Further information on gut contents from different populations supported those results. In the experiment, larvae of both species were exposed to contrasting food items: leaf litter and periphyton. Consumption, growth and the efficiency of food conversion were measured. K. kuscheli was able to feed on periphyton, though it did not grow. N. archiplatae failed to feed on leaf litter. While K. kuscheli might be considered a facultative shredder, N. archiplatae functions as a specialist scraper. The natural distribution and seasonal abundance in two small streams showed contrasting habitat use of both species. N. archiplatae inhabited high velocity runs and riffles underneath large substrates while K. kuscheli presented a higher habitat plasticity. Implications of those results for ecosystem function are discussed.

AB We synthesise the results of the papers in this Special Issue, place them within the context of current trends in floodplain research, and outline promising new avenues that emerge from the contributions. The indication system presented complements existing approaches by focussing on a quantitative indication of environmental parameters. A promising research line that emerges is an extension of the systematic comparison of taxonomic groups with contrasting traits in terms of their performance as quantitative indicators for different environmental parameters. The studies show similarities and dissimilarities in the traits explaining the functional response of plants, molluscs, carabids, and syrphids to site conditions but trait databases and studies on additional taxa are required before broad generalisations can be made. The rigorous study design developed for the RIVA project, of which all contributions in this Special Issue are a part, not only was essential for an improvement of the understanding of species environment relationships and the role biological traits play for it, it also provides a baseline for assessing future change as part of long-term ecological monitoring of floodplains.

AB The aim of this study was to identify shape patterns of the shoulder girdle in relation to different functional and environmental behaviours in turtles. The Procrustes method was used to compare the shoulder girdles (scapula and coracoid) of 88 adult extant turtles. The results indicate that four shape patterns can be distinguished. The shoulder girdles of (1) terrestrial (Testudinidae), (2) highly aquatic freshwater (Trionychidae, Carettochelyidae) and (3) marine turtles (Cheloniidae, Dermochelyidae) correspond to three specialized morphological patterns, whereas the shoulder girdle of (4) semi-aquatic freshwater turtles (Bataguridae, Chelidae, Chelydridae, Emydidae, Kinosternidae, Pelomedusidae, Platysternidae, Podocnemididae) is more generalized. In terrestrial turtles, the long scapular prong and the short coracoid are associated with a domed shell and a mode of locomotion in which walking is predominant. By contrast, highly aquatic freshwater turtles share traits with marine turtles. In both, the short scapular prong and the long coracoid are associated with a flat shell, and swimming locomotion. The enlarged attachment sites of the biceps, coracobrachialis magnus, and supracoracoideus also give these strong swimmers a mechanical advantage during adduction and retraction of the arm. Increasing size leads to allometrical shape changes that emphasize mechanical efficiency both in terrestrial and in aquatic turtles.

AB Three field-identified whitefish Coregonus lavaretus forms in Lake Muddusjarvi, Finland, were compared in morphology, diet and prey size. First, these forms were studied with univariate and multivariate analysis to assess morphological divergence at a higher resolution level than in the field. Second, stomach contents were analysed to estimate diet-overlap among forms. Finally, the relationship between prey size and morphology was examined. The whitefish were assigned to the initial field-classification with 99.2% and 98.8% accuracy for morphologic and meristic traits, respectively. The small sparsely-rakered form (SSR) had the shortest rakers and largest gillraker space, followed by the large sparsely-rakered form (LSR) with intermediate gillraker length and gillraker space, while densely-rakered whitefish (DR) had the longest rakers and smallest gillraker space. The two sparsely-rakered whitefish forms (LSR and SSR), consumed mainly benthic macroinvertebrates, while densely-rakered whitefish (DR), utilized pelagic food items. Average diet-overlaps between whitefish forms were low in June-September (Schoener's alpha = 0.02 - 0.23). Gillraker number and length were negatively correlated to prey length in the diet (r = -0.73, and r = -0.60), while gillraker space was positively correlated with prey length (r = 0.81). The fact that these whitefish forms were morphologically and ecologically segregated, and that gillraker traits probably have a functional value in food selection, further suggests that natural selection has been important in structuring life-history trajectories into divergent niche use.

AB Bottom trawling causes widespread physical disturbance of sediments in seas and oceans and affects benthic communities by removing target and non-target species and altering habitats. One aspiration of the ecosystem approach to management is to conserve function as well as biodiversity, but trawling impacts on benthic community function need to be understood before they can be managed. Here we present the large scale and long term impact of chronic trawling on the functional composition of benthic invertebrate communities using a comprehensive set of functional traits. The effects of chronic trawling disturbance on the functional composition of faunal benthic invertebrate communities, as sampled with a small beam trawl, were investigated at 6 to 13 sites in each of 4 contrasting regions of the North Sea. Each site was subject to known levels of trawling disturbance. Information on the life history and ecological function traits of the taxa sampled was translated into fuzzy coding and used to analyse the relationship between life history and functional roles within the ecosystem. Multivariate analyses were used to examine changes in the distribution of traits over gradients of trawling intensity. Changes in the functional structure of the community due to the effects of long-term trawling were identified in 3 of the 4 areas sampled. Filter-feeding, attached and larger animals were relatively more abundant in lightly trawled areas, while areas with higher levels of trawling were characterised by a higher relative biomass of mobile animals and infaunal and scavenging invertebrates. Univariate analysis of selected traits confirmed the patterns observed in multivariate analysis. These results demonstrate that chronic bottom trawling can lead to large scale shifts in the functional composition of benthic communities, with likely effects on the functioning of coastal ecosystems.

AB We investigated functional responses of benthic invertebrates to deposited sediment in four Missouri USA streams. In each stream, invertebrates were sampled along continuums of deposited sediment (particles < 2 mm in size) from 0 to 100% surface cover in reaches of fairly homogeneous substrate composition, current velocity, and water depths. Correlations, graphical representations, and the cumulative response curves of feeding and habit groups provided strong empirical support for distinct community functional changes due to deposited sediment. Feeding groups were more sensitive to deposited sediment than habit groups. Densities of all the feeding groups decreased significantly with increasing deposited sediment, while relative densities of gatherers increased significantly. Taxa richness also decreased significantly for all the feeding groups except for the shredders. Increases in deposited sediment were related to significant density decreases for only the clingers and sprawlers in the habit group, resulting in significant increases in the relative densities of both burrowers and climbers. Clingers, sprawlers, and swimmers also showed significant decreases in taxa richness.

AB 1. Multiple biological invertebrate traits (e.g. body size, body form, dispersal potential) each described through multiple categories (e.g. small, intermediate or large body size) could serve as indicators of particular types of human impacts on large rivers. The trait composition of natural invertebrate communities is scarcely constrained by taxonomic differences among them, i.e. individual trait categories could be used to discriminate various types of human impacts across large geographic areas, which would require the definition of trait patterns for conditions of relatively low human impact.
   2. Using large databases to link 14 biological traits (described through 66 categories) of invertebrate genera to their occurrence in running water reaches with known environmental conditions, we examined the accuracy of various approaches to predict expected trait variation across least impacted river reaches (LIRRs) of Europe in a stepwise analytical procedure. This procedure included Monte Carlo simulations and ultimately the assignment of test-LIRRs (reaches not used in previous analyses) to the previously defined LIRR conditions.
   3. Distance from the source was an integrative variable capturing some (but not all) landscape features (e.g. altitude) or habitat variables (e.g. reach shear stress). Correspondingly, the relative abundance of many trait categories changed along 13 European running waters, although particularly the intensity of these changes differed among these 13 running waters.
   4. 'Downstream models' (using only distance from the source as predictor) provided the least accurate predictions of expected invertebrate trait patterns when compared with 'landscape models' (using distance from the source in combination with altitude and/or latitude) or 'habitat models' (using reach shear stress, mean annual air temperature and/or pH of the water). Landscape models provided more accurate predictions than habitat models, but the improvement of predictions of expected invertebrate traits patterns obtained using landscape models was negligible in comparison with a simpler 'mean-model' approach, suggesting that defining LIRR conditions through simple descriptions of frequency distributions would be sufficient for the future biomonitoring of large European rivers.
   5. To define these LIRR conditions, we used the average of the relative abundance of each trait category from 68 LIRRs (>= 40 m wide) as expected LIRR values, and computed LIRR frequency distributions that described the deviations of the 68 individual LIRRs from these expected values. Computing such deviations from the expected LIRR values for 57 test-LIRRs (also >= 40 m wide), 57 trait categories correctly assigned > 90% of the test-LIRRs to LIRR conditions if the latter were defined through the entire range of the LIRR frequency distributions. To the 90%-range enveloped by the LIRR frequency distributions, 42 trait categories correctly assigned > 80% and 12 categories > 90% of the test-LIRRs.
   6. Using a framework that required no regionalisation of a large geographic area, no modelling of expected values using environmental information and no standardised invertebrate sampling, the performance of our trait approach to assign test-LIRRs to LIRR conditions encourages future assessments of deviations from these defined LIRR conditions in large European river reaches with different types of human impacts.

AB Wetland restoration designs do not frequently consider functional linkages among habitats in the estuarine landscape, nor do they focus sufficient attention on the role of marsh morphology in promoting the efficient exchange of materials and organisms between the intertidal and subtidal water column. These features should be considered, because many marine organisms may benefit from trophic subsidies from adjacent habitats without ever entering them. Stable isotopes were used to examine trophic linkages between primary producers and marine finfishes to highlight the importance of individual life history traits and to punctuate the argument for promoting habitat connectivity (exchange of materials and organisms) in restoration planning. We demonstrate that the trophic spectrum of an estuarine resident, the Moreno americana (white perch), and two marine transients, Anchoa mitchilli (bay anchovy) and Cynoscion regalis (weakfish), are largely functions of locally available organic matter distributed along a gradient of estuarine resources. In both salt marshes and open waters, there was a transition in whole-body isotopic composition in all three species associated with the estuary-wide gradient in nutrient availability ranging from macrophytes and benthic microalgae in marshes, to phytoplankton (as suspended particulate matter) in the open estuary. As anticipated, phytoplankton contributed more to bay anchovy and weakfish biomass, especially in open waters, than to white perch. Our results also suggest that marine transients benefit from the presence of salt marshes without necessarily occupying them. Thus the estuarine "commissary" serves up different recipes in different regions, and the many estuarine-dependent species apparently take full advantage of these varied sources of primary production at the base of the food web when seeking energy for rapid growth and survival.

AB The factors that control biodiversity have been the focus of numerous recent investigations; these include species interactions, speciation, environmental gradients and heterogeneity, all of these operating differently at each observation scale. We used a null model to examine the influence of two forces shaping the community structure of Dactylogyrus species parasitic on roach (Rutilus rutilus) gills: interspecific competition that might prevent the coexistence of the most similar species and environmental filters that might result in the most similar species coexisting together. The study was carried out on two sets of fish from two different localities in the Morava river basin (Czech Republic) to evaluate the consistency of the results across host populations, and at three different scales of observation to test for the scale dependence of assembly rules. In decreasing order, from largest to smallest, the three spatial scales investigated were: the individual fish, the individual gill arch and individual sections of each gill arch. The similarity between pairs of parasite species was measured using three different criteria: (1) phylogeny, (2) quantitative functional traits consisting of parasite size and morphometric measurements of the attachment organ's sclerotized parts and (3) qualitative attributes of reproductive organs. First, our study reveals a strong conservatism of ecological characters for the nine Dactylogyrus parasite species, in particular regarding the attributes of their copulatory organs. Second, our study did not find any limitation of similarity among coexisting Dactylogyrus species due to interspecific competition, irrespective of the scale and the similarity measures considered. Conversely, our results support the niche filtering hypothesis, preventing the co-occurrence of species too dissimilar from one another. This process is particularly apparent at the scale of the individual fish and for functional traits associated with the hard parts of the parasites' attachment organs. In both localities, the Dactylogyrus species that occur on the same fish individuals tend to have similar values for the haptor dimensions. Our study supports previous studies on monogenean parasite communities indicating a weak influence of competition as a structuring force, but it goes a step further by identifying environmental filtering as a key process shaping these communities.

AB Variation in behavior, morphology and life history traits of larval anurans across predator gradients, and consequences of that variation, have been abundantly studied. Yet the functional link between morphology and burst-swimming speed is largely unknown. We conducted experiments with two divergent species of anurans, Scaphiopus holbrookii and Rana sphenocephala, to examine how behavior and morphology influence predator vulnerability, and whether tadpole shape is related to burst-swimming performance. Scaphiopus holbrookii, a species that typically uses ephemeral pools, was more active, exhibited slower burst speeds, and was more susceptible to predation than R. sphenocephala, a species associated with more permanent aquatic sites. Our analysis of morphology and burst speed defined a shared axis of shape variation associated with burst-swimming speed regardless of species. Tadpoles with a deeper tail fin and muscle and a smaller body produced faster speeds. The nature and breadth of the morphology-speed relationship suggests it may represent a generalized ecomorphological paradigm for larval anurans.

AB Dams are expected to decrease fish diversity because they deeply alter downstream environment. However, such decline has not been consistently observed although profound modifications in the structure and/or composition of fish communities were generally recorded, and were linked to modifications of the downstream environment. In this work we analyze data from observations made before and almost 10 years after the completion of a hydroelectric dam in the neotropics. We monitored fish diversity below that dam and compared the taxonomic and functional structures of the samples between the pre- and post-dam periods. A significant decrease in species richness was evidenced. Taxonomic and trophic structures were significantly different between the two periods. Conversely, the functional structure of samples based on reproductive traits did not change significantly after the damming. Concerning feeding habits, a large increase in relative abundance of detritivores and a parallel decrease of fish species feeding on terrestrial food sources were observed in samples taken 6-9 years after closure of the dam as compared with samples taken before the dam.

AB Freshwater biodiversity is threatened by several mechanisms, of which the introduction of non-indigenous species and habitat alteration are the two most important. Exotic species act at various levels of organisation of macroinvertebrate communities, and are involved in different processes mediating their impacts on biodiversity, such as habitat modification or negative interactions with autochthonous fauna. The present work gives a list of the 43 French freshwater non-indigenous species, which represent 1.2% of the French freshwater macroinvertebrates. We provide their geographic origins, their distributions among zoological units by comparison with the native fauna and their functional characteristics according to a recent typology based on bio/ecological traits. An exponential trend of the cumulated number of non-indigenous species was evidenced, with a clumping of invaders within crustaceans and molluscs. Donor areas of non-indigenous species are in majority European, and the Ponto-Caspian basin is identified as the principal one. This pattern could be explained by a spread along waterways but its origin lies in a process of recolonisation of defaunated areas following several episodes of glaciation/deglaciation in Western Europe during the last 80,000 years. Finally, from a functional point of view, non-indigenous species exhibit a limited diversity, with two functional groups representing 80% of them.

As a consequence, communities developed under same environmental conditions should present the same combination of species bio-ecological characteristics. The objective was to verify, using data from the same biogeographical zone, (1) if there was a unique suite of bio-ecological profiles for reference macrobenthic communities of 'comparable' rivers or (2) if the distribution of bio-ecological traits within reference communities was significantly influenced by geology. The variability of 22 bio-ecological traits in 12 different sites was tested to evaluate the potential influence of geological substrate on biological and ecological features of reference stream communities. Observed patterns suggested that communities displayed highly stable bio-ecological profiles among sites (within a given biogeographical zone) whatever the substrate was, even if communities on clayey substrate exhibited slightly different bio/ecological characteristics than on others geologies. Nevertheless, the functional structure of macrobenthic communities in reference sites was quite stable in this biogeographical area. This study was restricted to the selected stream types and its results may not directly be transferred to other biogeographical areas and stream types. However, the perspective of a unique functional reference for streams of the same order in a given biogeographical area, improve functional comparison between observed vs. reference communities. This could simplify and objectively define the ecological status of a given site.

AB African cichlid fishes have repeatedly evolved highly specialized modes of feeding through adaptations of their oral jaws. Here, we explore the molecular genetic basis of the opening and closing lever mechanisms of the cichlid lower jaw, which have traditionally been used to describe the mechanics of feeding behavior in bony fishes. Quantitative genetic analyses demonstrate that the opening and closing mechanisms are genetically modular and therefore free to evolve independently. Bmp4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4) is one of two loci that segregate with the mechanical advantage of closing and that together account for > 30% of the phenotypic variance in this trait. Species-specific differences in jaw shape are obvious early in cichlid larval development and are correlated with patterns of bmp4 expression in the mandibular primordium. When bmp4 is overexpressed in the obligate suction feeder Danio rerio, mandibular morphology exhibits specific transformations of opening and closing lever ratios. We conclude that patterns of morphological integration of the cichlid jaw reflect a balance among conflicting functional demands. Further, we demonstrate that bmp4 has the potential to alter mandibular morphology in a way that mimics adaptive variation among fish species.

AB With the increasing alteration of flow regimes worldwide, it has become a key challenge to estimate the general linkages between species and flow patterns. In fish, the young-of-the-year (YOY) cohort size is of fundamental importance to population dynamics, and can provide valuable insights into part of the ecological functioning of river systems. Here, using 65 French sites, each with at least 4 annual samples, I investigated the influence of the seasonal inter-annual flow variability on the YOY fish assemblage within sites. Assemblage structure was described by relative abundances of species, diversity measurements (richness and Shannon's index) and species traits. Flow statistics were derived so as to reflect average conditions, low and high flow conditions, floods and overall variability, and were computed for each biological season (reproduction, growth and overwinter periods). Relationships were explored and tested by within-site co-inertia analysis, and quantified by ANCOVA models. The flow levels during the reproduction and growth periods consistently explained differences among years in 4 species guilds, although average relationships were weak (i.e. max. similar to 9%). Assemblage diversity slightly declined with increasing water level during the growth period. Species responses depended on their biological and functional abilities to ensure their reproductive success under adverse hydrological conditions (e. g. time of spawning, fecundity, protection of offspring), and clearly reflected two contrasting reproductive strategies. These results are in general agreement with 'habitat template'-based theories. They suggest that flow may be locally managed to sustain or restore taxonomic or functional assemblage features, keeping in mind that the strength of the expected effect is site-specific.

AB During metamorphosis, most amphibians undergo rapid shifts in their morphology that allow them to move from an aquatic to a more terrestrial existence. Two important challenges associated with this shift in habitat are the necessity to switch from an aquatic to terrestrial mode of locomotion and changes in the thermal environment. In this study, I investigated the consequences of metamorphosis to the burst swimming and running performance of the European newt Triturus cristatus to determine the nature and magnitude of any locomotor trade-offs that occur across life-history stages. In addition, I investigated whether there were any shifts in the thermal dependence of performance between life-history stages of T. cristatus to compensate for changes in their thermal environment during metamorphosis. A trade-off between swimming and running performance was detected across life-history stages, with metamorphosis resulting in a simultaneous decrease in swimming and increase in running performance. Although the terrestrial habitat of postmetamorphic stages of the newt T. cristatus experienced greater daily fluctuations in temperature than the aquatic habitat of the larval stage, no differences in thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance were detected between the larval aquatic and postmetamorphic stages. The absence of variation across life-history stages of T. cristatus may indicate that thermal sensitivity may be a conservative trait across ontogenetic stages in amphibians, but further studies are required to investigate this assertion.

The only functional ovary (left) was foliaceous in shape having the ventral surface without an ovarian capsule. The absence of the ovarian capsule ventral portion, absence of oviduct and funnel-shaped coelomic cavity are features that imply that oocytes are freed in the coelomic cavity before being shed to the aquatic environment through a genital papilla. The only functional testis (left) was cord-like with a maximum diameter of 1-1.5 cm and was connected to the genital papilla through a spermatic duct. Size at sexual maturity was 145-154 cm and 115-124 cm, total length class, for females and males, respectively.

AB The San Pedro River in the southwestern United States retains a natural flood regime and has several reaches with perennial stream flow and shallow ground water. However, much of the river flows intermittently. Urbanization-linked declines in regional ground-water levels have raised concerns over the future status of the riverine ecosystem in some parts of the river, while restoration-linked decreases in agricultural ground-water pumping are expected to increase stream flows in other parts. This study describes the response of the streamside herbaceous vegetation to changes in stream flow permanence. During the early summer dry season, streamside, herbaceous cover and species richness declined continuously across spatial gradients of flow permanence, and composition shifted from hydric to mesic species at sites with more intermittent flow. Hydrologic threshold values were evident for one plant functional group: Schoenoplectus acutus, Juncus torreyi, and other hydric riparian plants declined sharply in cover with loss of perennial stream flow. In contrast, cover of mesic riparian perennials (including Cynodon dactylon, an introduced species) increased at sites with intermittent flow. Patterns of hydric and mesic riparian annuals varied by season: in the early summer dry season their cover declined continuously as flow became more intermittent, while in the late summer wet season their cover increased as the flow became more intermittent. Periodic drought at the intermittent sites may increase opportunities for establishment of these annuals during the monsoonal flood season. During the late summer flood season. stream flow was present at most sites, and fewer vegetation traits were correlated with flow permanence; cover and richness were correlated with other environmental factors including site elevation and substrate nitrate level and particle size. Although perennial-flow and intermittent-flow sites support different streamside plant communities, all of the plant functional groups are abundant at perennial-flow sites when viewing the ecosystem at broader spatial and temporal scales: mesic riparian perennials are common in the floodplain zone adjacent to the river channel and late-summer hydric and mesic annuals are periodically abundant after large floods.

AB 1. Biodiversity-environment relationships are increasingly well-understood in the context of species richness and species composition, whereas other aspects of biodiversity, including variability in functional diversity (FD), have received rather little rigorous attention. For streams, most studies to date have examined either taxonomic assemblage patterns or have experimentally addressed the importance of species richness for ecosystem functioning.
   2. I examined the relationships of the functional biodiversity of stream macroinvertebrates to major environmental and spatial gradients across 111 boreal headwater streams in Finland. Functional biodiversity encompassed functional richness (FR - the number of functional groups derived from a combination of functional feeding groups and habit trait groups), FD - the number of functional groups and division of individuals among these groups, and functional evenness (FE - the division of individuals among functional groups). Furthermore, functional structure (FS) comprised the composition and abundance of functional groups at each site.
   3. FR increased with increasing pH, with additional variation related to moss cover, total nitrogen, water colour and substratum particle size. FD similarly increased with increasing pH and decreased with increasing canopy cover. FE decreased with increasing canopy cover and water colour. Significant variation in FS was attributable to pH, stream width, moss cover, substratum particle size, nitrogen, water colour with the dominant pattern in FS being related to the increase of shredder-sprawlers and the decrease of scraper-swimmers in acidic conditions.
   4. In regression analysis and redundancy analysis, variation in functional biodiversity was not only related to local environmental factors, but a considerable proportion of variability was also attributable to spatial patterning of environmental variables and pure spatial gradients. For FR, 23.4% was related to pure environmental effects, 15.0% to shared environmental and spatial effects and 8.0% to spatial trends. For FD, 13.8% was attributable to environmental effects, 15.2% to shared environmental and spatial effects and 5% to spatial trends. For FE, 9.0% was related to environmental variables, 12.7% to shared effects of environmental and spatial variables and 4.5% to spatial variables. For FS, 13.5% was related to environmental effects, 16.9% to shared environmental and spatial effects and 15.4% to spatial trends.
   5. Given that functional biodiversity should portray variability in ecosystem functioning, one might expect to find functionally rather differing ecosystems at the opposite ends of major environmental gradients (e.g. acidity, stream size). However, the degree to which variation in the functional biodiversity of stream macroinvertebrates truly portrays variability in ecosystem functioning is difficult to judge because species traits, such as feeding roles and habit traits, are themselves strongly affected by the habitat template.
   6. If functional characteristics show strong responses to natural environmental gradients, they also are likely to do so to anthropogenic environmental changes, including changes in habitat structure, organic inputs and acidifying elements. However, given the considerable degree of spatial structure in functional biodiversity, one should not expect that only the local environment and anthropogenic changes therein are responsible for this variability. Rather, the spatial context, as well as natural variability along environmental gradients, should also be explicitly considered in applied research.

AB We predicted that substratum freezing and instability are major determinants of the variability of stream community structure in Arctic Alaska. Their effects were conceptualized as a two-dimensional habitat template that was assessed using a natural experiment based on five stream types (mountain-spring, tundra-spring, tundra, mountain, glacier). Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) indicated distinct macroinvertebrate assemblages for each stream type. The contribution of functional feeding groups to assemblage biomass varied systematically among stream types, indicating that structure and function are linked. Assemblage position within a DCA biplot was used to assess factors controlling its structure. Springs separated from other stream types along a gradient of nutrient concentration and freezing probability. Glacier and mountain streams separated from springs and tundra streams along a gradient of substratum instability and freezing probability. Owing to differences in sources of discharge to streams, the effects of nutrients and substratum stability could not be separated from freezing. Although many factors likely contribute to the variability of Arctic stream communities, the major determinants may be conceptualized as a template structured by gradients in (i) nutrient supply and substratum freezing and (ii) substratum instability and substratum freezing. This template provides a basis for predicting the response of Arctic stream communities to climate change.

AB The freshwater crab Sesarma fossarum (Decapoda, Brachyura, Sesarmidae) was only recently described as a new species. As in most other endemic Jamaican crabs that have radiated in limnic and terrestrial environments, its early life history has been largely unknown. In an experimental laboratory study this species was reared through embryonic, larval, and early juvenile development, and ontogenetic changes in biomass (contents of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen) were measured. The duration of egg development varied greatly within a single brood, such that larval hatching occurred through an extended period (12 d). Larval development invariably consisted of two non-feeding (fully lecithotrophic) zoeal stages and a facultatively lecithotrophic megalopa, followed by metamorphosis to the first juvenile crab stage (always feeding). The zoeal phase lasted on average 4-5 d, while the megalopa required 8-10 d. This abbreviated and largely food-independent mode of development is interpreted as a life-history adaptation to conditions of food limitation in the breeding habitat of this species (presumably maternal burrows dug in river banks). This strategy is based on an enhanced maternal energy investment in the production of large, yolk-rich eggs; (ca. 1.4 mm size, 0.6-0.7 mg dry mass). The megalopa shows a highly flexible nutritional strategy where the appearance of a functional feeding system allows for exploitation of external energy sources, while its development remains, in principle, independent of scarcely available food. However, when megalopae were reared without any food, the first juvenile crab stage showed an enhanced mortality and a reduced body size. Decreasing C, H, and C:N values indicate that the fully endotrophic (embryonic and zoeal) phase is principally based on. a utilization of lipid reserves; the same applies to the development of megalopae reared in a continued absence of food. In fed megalopae, increasing N and decreasing C:N values indicate that dietary energy was primarily invested in protein synthesis, required for the construction of new tissues and organs. Similarity in the reproductive, developmental, and bioenergetic traits of S fossarum and other limnic or terrestrial crabs from Jamaica suggest that food limitation during the early larval phase has been one of the principal selection factors driving the evolution of the endemic non-marine clade of sesarmids towards increasing egg size and larval lecithotrophy.

AB The spread of non-indigenous species and the decline of autochthonous ones are leading to a homogenization of freshwater fauna in terms of systematic units, but the functional consequences are poorly documented. We studied the peculiar case of the lower, French section of the Moselle River where 20 invertebrate species have been introduced since 1854, with a rate increasing exponentially with time. Dredge sampling performed in 1994, 1996, 2000 and 2001 at four sampling stations allowed for an evaluation of faunal changes in terms of composition, structure and function. During this period, no structural changes were recorded in spite of multiple, new and successful introductions. The evaluation of functional modifications was based on a typology of taxa exhibiting homogeneous biological/ecological traits. Functional diversity, measured as the diversity of taxa distribution among functional groupings, revealed a significant increase between 1994/1996 and 2000/2001 because those species that were over-represented during the former period reached more equilibrated densities during the latter. The major, indirect implications of these functional. changes are discussed.

AB The last decade has seen an explosion in the number of studies exploring predator-induced plasticity. Recently, there has been a call for more comprehensive approaches that can identify functional relationships between traits, constraints on phenotypic responses, and the cost and benefits of alternative phenotypes. In this study, we exposed Helisoma trivolvis, a freshwater snail, to a factorial combination of three resource levels and five predator environments (no predator, one or two water bugs, and one or two crayfish) and examined ten traits including behavior, morphology, and life history. Each predator induced a unique suite of behavioral and morphological responses. Snails increased near-surface habitat use with crayfish but not with water bugs. Further, crayfish induced narrow and high shells whereas water bugs induced wide shells and wide apertures. In terms of life history, both predators induced delayed reproduction and greater mass at reproduction. However, crayfish induced a greater delay in reproduction that resulted in reduced fecundity whereas water bugs did not induce differences in fecundity. Resource levels impacted the morphology of H. trivolvis; snails reared with greater resource levels produced higher shells, narrower shells, and wider apertures. Resource levels also impacted snail life history; lower resources caused longer times to reproduction and reduced fecundity. Based on an analysis of phenotypic correlations, the morphological responses to each predator most likely represent phenotypic trade-offs. Snails could either produce invasion-resistant shells for defense against water bugs or crush-resistant shells for defense against crayfish, but not both. Our use of a comprehensive approach to examine the responses of H. trivolvis has provided important information regarding the complexity of phenotypic responses to different environments, the patterns of phenotypic integration across environments, and the potential costs and benefits associated with plastic traits.

AB Many aquatic systems depend on allochthonous organic matter. Quality of litter differs between plant species. Therefore, the composition of the surrounding vegetation may influence litter decomposition and other processes in aquatic food webs. We recorded the abundance of insect larvae, as well as the diversity of cultivable fungi and bacteria, the metabolic diversity of the microflora, and leaf litter decomposition rates in aquatic outdoor microcosms, using litter from four broad-leaved tree species and a mixture of the four litter types. Diversity of fungi, abundance of bacteria and functional diversity of the microflora and decomposition differed between microcosms with litter from each of the four tree species. For microcosms with the mixture of litter, observed values of all measured variables did not differ from the expectations derived from microcosms with litter from only one tree species. We conclude that specific traits of the component litter species (e. g. C/N ratio) outweigh possible non-additive effects in mixtures. Our results contrast with findings in terrestrial systems where decomposition rates of mixtures are not always predictable from the rates measured for the component species.

AB Many species with complex life histories can respond to risk by adaptively altering the timing of key life history switch points, including hatching. It is generally thought that such hatching plasticity involves a trade-off between embryonic and hatchling predation risk, e.g., hatching early to escape egg predation comes at the cost of increased vulnerability to hatchling predators. However, most empirical work has focused on simply detecting predator- induced hatching responses or on the short-term consequences of hatching plasticity. Short-term studies may not allow sufficient time for hatchlings to exhibit compensatory responses, which may extend to subsequent life stages and could alter the nature of the trade-offs associated with hatching plasticity. In this study, we examine the consequences of predator-induced hatching plasticity through the larval stage to metamorphosis in the East African reed frog, Hyperolius spinigularis. To do this we conducted an experiment in which we manipulated initial larval size and density (mimicking the effects of egg predators) and the presence of aquatic predators. We expected that predator-induced hatchlings (because they are less developed and smaller) would experience higher per capita predation rates and a longer larval period and thus would exhibit lower survival to metamorphosis in the presence of aquatic predators than larger, more developed, later hatched larvae. Surprisingly, we found that predator- induced hatchlings survived better, not worse, than hatchlings from undisturbed clutches. These results motivated us to develop a model parameterized from additional experiments to explore whether a combination of mechanisms, compensatory growth, and density- and size-specific predation, could give rise to this pattern. Predicted survival probabilities from the model with compensatory growth were consistent with those from the field experiment: early hatched larvae grew more rapidly through vulnerable size classes than later hatched larvae, resulting in higher survival at metamorphosis. Thus, in this system, there does not appear to be a trade-off in vulnerability between egg and larval predators. Instead, our results suggest that the cost that balances the survival benefit of hatching early to evade egg predators arises later in the life history, as a result of smaller size at metamorphosis.

AB Many examples of the appearance of similar traits in different lineages are known during the evolution of organisms. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms have been elucidated in very few cases. Here, we provide a clear example of evolutionary parallelism, involving changes in the same genetic pathway, providing functional adaptation of RH1 pigments to deep-water habitats during the adaptive radiation of East African cichlid fishes. We determined the RH1 sequences from 233 individual cichlids. The reconstruction of cichlid RH1 pigments with 11-cis-retinal from 28 sequences showed that the absorption spectra of the pigments of nine species were shifted toward blue, tuned by two particular amino acid replacements. These blue-shifted RH1 pigments might have evolved as adaptations to the deep-water photic environment. Phylogenetic evidence indicates that one of the replacements, A292S, has evolved several times independently, inducing similar functional change. The parallel evolution of the same mutation at the same amino acid position suggests that the number of genetic changes underlying the appearance of similar traits in cichlid diversification may be fewer than previously expected.

AB We used phylogenetically based comparative analyses to test for associations between extinction risk in European freshwater fishes and a variety of life history, ecological, and biogeographical traits. Based on the World Conservation Union classification scheme, a total of 47% of Europe's 287 native species are classified as threatened with extinction. Threatened species are significantly smaller than less-threatened species in the same genera when analyses are restricted to fully freshwater species. This trend is reversed when anadromous genera are included. These comprise many large-bodied species in which fishing has often played a greater role in declines than in other taxa. Threatened species did not differ significantly in their habitats, although they tended to occupy a narrower variety of habitats biased toward streams and rivers. Threatened species occupy much narrower latitudinal ranges than close relatives that are less threatened, and they also have more southerly distributions where pressures on habitats are intense. This study suggests that links between life histories and threat status of freshwater fishes are not as clearcut as for marine species. For fish restricted entirely to freshwater, small-bodied species are most at risk owing to their naturally small ranges, which may put them in a more precarious position when their habitats are impacted by humans.

AB Recent work suggests that the effect of extinction on ecosystem function depends on whether or not species have identical extinction risks. Here, we use a simple model of community dynamics to predict how the functional consequences of random and non-random extinction may differ. The model suggests that when resource partitioning or facilitation structures communities, the functional consequences of non-random extinction depend on the covariance between species traits and cumulative extinction risks, and the compensatory responses among survivors. Strong competition increases the difference between random and ordered extinctions, but mutualisms reduce the difference. When diversity affects function via a sampling effect, the difference between random and ordered extinction depends on the covariance between species traits and the change in the probability of being the competitive dominant caused by ordered extinction. These findings show how random assembly experiments can be combined with information about species traits to make qualitative predictions about the functional consequences of various extinction scenarios.

AB Human activities have increased N availability dramatically in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Extensive research demonstrates that local plant species diversity generally declines in response to nutrient enrichment, yet the mechanisms for this decline remain unclear. Based on an analysis of >900 species responses from 34 N-fertilization experiments across nine terrestrial ecosystems in North America, we show that both trait-neutral and trait-based mechanisms operate simultaneously to influence diversity loss as production increases. Rare species were often lost because of soil fertilization, randomly with respect to traits. The risk of species loss due to fertilization ranged from >60% for the rarest species to 10% for the most abundant species. Perennials, species with N-fixing symbionts, and those of native origin also experienced increased risk of local extinction after fertilization, regardless of their initial abundance. Whereas abundance was consistently important across all systems, functional mechanisms were often system-dependent. As IN availability continues to increase globally, management that focuses on locally susceptible functional groups and generally susceptible rare species will be essential to maintain biodiversity.

AB 1. Changes in species distributions along rivers have rarely been observed independently of changes in environmental conditions and meaningful comparison between different catchments is made difficult by the limited geographical distribution of species. This study presents a new approach to quantify the effect of the spatial structure of lowland river networks on aquatic plant distribution and to explore the potential underlying processes using species life-history characteristics.
   2. Twenty-five species of aquatic vascular plants recorded in 62 sites across five calcareous river basins were used to investigate (i) the temporal turnover of plant species, (ii) the habitat utilisation of species, (iii) the trade-offs between different plant life-history characteristics and (iv) the relationship between species life-history characteristics and habitat utilisation.
   3. The annual plant turnover within a 3-year period was, although significant, extremely low. It suggests that results from spatial surveys conducted over 3 years should not be undermined by temporal changes.
   4. Spatial connectivity along and between rivers was more important than in-channel physical characteristics in shaping species assemblages. Neither chemical factors (ammonium, phosphate) nor extrinsic biotic competitors (filamentous green algae) significantly influenced plant distribution.
   5. The most common combinations of life-history characteristics were neither related to environmental conditions nor to spatial isolation. Instead, they could reflect natural selection processes associated with larger scales than those considered in this study.
   6. Plant distribution was most strongly related to the dispersal and regeneration abilities of the plants, supporting the hypotheses relating to longitudinal connectivity. The hypothesis that different growth forms would be associated with different in-channel physical features was not verified. As expected, there were no substantial differences in plant life-history characteristics between river basins.

AB The main objective of this study was to measure the impact of benthic invertebrate diversity on processes occurring at the water-sediment interface. We analyzed the effects of interactions between three shallow water species (Cerastoderma edule, Corophium volutator, and Nereis diversicolor). The impacts of different species richness treatments were measured on sediment reworking, bacterial characteristics, and biogeochemical processes (bromide fluxes, O-2 uptake, nutrient fluxes, and porewater chemistry) in sediment cores. The results showed that the three species exhibited different bioturbation activities in the experimental system: C. edule acted as a biodiffusor, mixing particles in the top 2 cm of the sediments; C. volutator produced and irrigated U-shaped tubes in the top 2 cm of the sediments; and N. diversicolor produced and irrigated burrow galleries in the whole sediment cores. C. edule had minor effects on biogeochemical processes, whereas the other species, through their irrigation of the burrows, increased the Solute exchange between the water column and the sediment two-fold. These impacts on sediment structure and solute transport increased the O-2 consumption and the release of nutrients from sediments. As N. diversicolor burrowed deeper in the sediment than C. volutator, it irrigated a greater volume of sediments, with great impact on the sediment cores.
   Most treatments with a mixture of species indicated that observed values were often lower than predicted values from the addition of the individual effects of each species, demonstrating a negative interaction among species. This type of negative interaction measured between species on ecosystem processes certainly resulted from an overlap of bioturbation activities among the three species which, lived and foraged in the same habitat (water-sediment interface). All treatments with N. diversicolor (in isolation and in mixture) produced similar effect on sediment reworking, water fluxes, nutrient releases, porewater chemistry, and bacterial characteristics. Whichever species associated with N. diversicolor, the bioturbation activities of the worm hid the effect of the other species. The results suggest that, in the presence of several species that use and modify the same sediment space, impact of invertebrates on ecosystem processes was essentially due to the most efficient bioturbator of the community (N. diversicolor). In consequence, the functional traits (mode of bioturbation, depth of burrowing, feeding behaviour) of an individual species in a community could be more important than species richness for some ecosystem processes.

AB 1. High-gradient mountain streams are ideal for studying longitudinal biological patterns, although the degree of similarity in the biological gradient among physically similar streams in a region is poorly known. Our first objective was to evaluate variability in benthic communities along four streams in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado. We analysed the relative influence of longitudinal position versus reach-scale physical variables on community structure and measured community similarity at comparable longitudinal positions on the four streams.
   2. Our second objective was to evaluate the relative utility of taxonomically versus functionally defined communities to characterise assemblage structure: are taxonomic patterns more predictable along the gradient than are patterns of ecologically important species traits?
   3. Redundancy analyses (RDA), including measures of both reach-scale environmental variables (substratum properties, periphytic cover, local channel slope) and longitudinal position (altitude, stream size), confirmed that the longitudinal position of a site was most important in determining taxonomic composition. Functional community structure was also influenced by longitudinal position, but reach-scale variables (especially periphyton and median particle size) were of greater importance.
   4. Redundancy analyses explained 29.3 % of total taxonomic variance and 26.0 % of functional variance, indicating that defining assemblages functionally provides no greater understanding of community patterns given several known environmental variables. Strict longitudinal limits of taxa, the presumably identical regional species pool across our sites, and/or trade-offs among different types of species traits probably explain this result.
   5. Redundancy analyses did suggest, however, that traits related to longer life (semivoltinism, long-lived adults, and slow larval development) were more common downstream, while long-distance dispersal ability and high fecundity were associated with higher altitude and its associated harsher conditions.
   6. When sampling sites were grouped into three ecological zones defined by altitude, mean community similarity (measured both taxonomically and functionally) was lowest across streams at the highest altitude. This pattern could be driven by increased insularity of alpine-zone streams, resulting from a combination of harsh terrestrial environment, lack of hydrological connectivity, and limited species ranges along the longitudinal continuum.

AB Sessile organisms often exhibit morphological changes in response to permanent exposure to mechanical stimulation (wind or water movements). The adaptive value of these morphological changes (hydrodynamic performance and consequences on fitness) has not been studied extensively, particularly for higher plants submitted to flow stress. The aim was to determine the adaptive value of morphological patterns observed within two higher aquatic plant species, Berula erecta and Mentha aquatica, growing along a natural flow stress gradient. The hydrodynamic ability of each ramet was investigated through quantitative variables (drag coefficient and E-value). Fitness-related traits based on vegetative growth and clonal multiplication were assessed for each individual. For both species, the drag coefficient and the E-value were explained only to a limited extent by the morphological traits used. B. erecta exhibited a reduction in size and low overall plant drag at higher flow velocities, despite high drag values relative to leaf area, due to a low flexibility. The plants maintained their fitness, at least in part, through biomass reallocation: one tall ramet at low velocity, but shorter individuals with many interconnected stolons when flow velocity increased. For M. aquatica, morphological differences along the velocity gradient did not lead to greater hydrodynamic performance. Plant size increased with increasing velocities, suggesting the indirect effects of current favouring growth in high velocities. The fitness-related traits did not demonstrate lower plant fitness for high velocities. Different developmental constraints linked to plant morphology and trade-offs between major plant functions probably lead to different plant responses to flow stress.

AB Spatial patterns in the combinations of biological traits of fish communities were studied in the Garonne River system (57 000 km(2), south-west France). Fish species assemblages were recorded at 554 sampling sites, and the biological traits of species were described using a fuzzy-coding method. A co-inertia analysis of species distributions and biological traits identified some spatial patterns of species trait combinations. Fish species richness progressively increased from up- to downstream sections, and the longitudinal patterns of fish assemblages partitioned the river into clear bio-geographic areas, such as the brown trout Salmo trutta (headwater streams), the grayling Thymallus thymallus, the barbel Barbus bat-bus and the bream Abramis brama zones (most downstream sections), which fitted with Huet's well-known zonation for western European rivers. Only a few biological traits, chiefly related to life-history attributes, significantly influenced the observed fish distributions. Fecundity, potential size, maximum age and reproductive factor increased from headwater to plain reaches. As a theoretical framework for assessing and predicting the functional organization of stream fish communities, spatial variations in species traits can be related to habitat conditions, thus providing explicit spatial schemes that may be useful to the design of both scientific studies and river management.

AB Parasitism has long been emphasised as an important process structuring animal communities. However, empirical evidence documenting the impact of parasites in other than simple laboratory settings is lacking. Here we examine the trait-mediated indirect effects of echinostome trematodes on a New Zealand soft bottom intertidal community of macroinvertebrates. Curtuteria australis and a second related but undescribed trematode both utilise the cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi as second intermediate host in which the parasites infect the foot tissue. Heavily infected cockles are therefore more sessile than lightly infected individuals, and, unable to bury, often rest on the sediment surface. We utilised these behavioural changes in two long term field experiments, respectively manipulating the parasite load of buried cockle (i.e. bioturbation), and the density of surfaced cockles (i.e. surface structures and seabed hydrodynamics). Both high parasite loads in buried cockles and the presence of surfaced cockles increased species richness and generally also the density of certain species and of major systematic and functional groups of benthic macroinvertebrates. Species diversity (alpha) peaked under intermediate densities of surfaced cockles. Our results demonstrate that parasites, solely through their impact on the behaviour of a single community member, can be significant determinants of animal community structure and function.

AB 1. Studies on biodiversity and ecosystem function require considering metrics for accurately describing the functional diversity of communities. The number of taxa (richness) is commonly used to characterise biological diversity. The disadvantage of richness as a measure of biological diversity is that all taxa are taken into account on an equal basis regardless of their abundance, their biological characteristics or their function in the ecosystem.
   2. To circumvent this problem, we applied a recently described measure of biological diversity that incorporates dissimilarities among taxa. Dissimilarities were defined from biological traits (e.g. life history, morphology, physiology and behaviour) of stream invertebrate taxa and the resulting biological diversity index was considered as a surrogate for functional diversity.
   3. As sampling effort is known to affect the number of taxa collected within a reach, we investigated how change in functional diversity is affected by sampling effort. We used stream invertebrate community data from three large European rivers to model accumulation curves and to assess the number of samples required to estimate (i.e. closeness to the maximal value) functional diversity and genera richness. We further evaluated the precision of estimates (i.e. similarity of temporal or spatial replicates) of the total functional diversity.
   4. As expected, richness estimates were strongly dependent on sampling effort, and 10 replicate samples were found to underestimate actual richness. Moreover, richness estimates showed much variation with season and location. In contrast, functional diversity had greater accuracy with less sampling effort and the precision of the estimates was higher than richness both across sampling occasions and sampling reaches. These results are further arguments towards conducting research on the design of a biomonitoring tool based on biological traits.

AB Altogether 64 predominantly biological traits were coded for more than 600 macroinvertebrate species from European rivers. The main question was: Are biological traits able to reflect "biological functionality" in large rivers and if so, is it possible to deduce an assessment system based on functionality? Analysis of the raw trait structure of all species indicates that these traits are not completely independent from their higher systematic units. To avoid misinterpretations when judging from mixtures of habitats (beta-biocoenosis) we used for our investigations only sample series from alpha-biocoenosis, pre-tested by a mathematical criterion of homogeneity. Within cc-biocoenosis, traits are shown to be able to compensate for drastic changes with respect to species number and species composition along a river continuum, demonstrating their functional quality. Long-term changes in the trait and species structures of German waterways were studied using multivariate methods, based on an analysis of 142 sampling series. A shift from traits typical for K-strategists to traits typical for r-strategists was detected to be the main background variable. The rK-strategy is regarded as a true functional character of species. We calculated the relative positions of all trait-coded species on this rK-scale, and plotted the functional diversity of our samples against the structural diversity of the species from several river systems. Rivers extremely dominated by r-strategists show a deficit in functional diversity. Rivers dominated by K-strategists also show deficits, possibly in concordance with modern ecological theories such as the intermediate disturbance theory. The quantitative proportions of extreme r- to K-Strategists in alpha-biocoenosis can be used as a general disturbance measure.

AB Rapid changes in biodiversity are occurring globally, yet the ecological impacts of diversity loss are poorly understood. Here we use data from marine invertebrate communities to parameterize models that predict how extinctions will. affect sediment bioturbation, a process vital to the persistence of aquatic communities. We show that species extinction is generally expected to reduce bioturbation, but the magnitude of reduction depends on how the functional traits of individual species covary with their risk of extinction. As a result, the particular cause of extinction and the order in which species are lost ultimately govern the ecosystem-level consequences of biodiversity loss.

AB Adaptive radiation resulting from differential selection acting on functional features is believed to be an important source of biodiversity. In this study, morphometric measures and mitochondrial DNA are used to test for adaptive radiation within four fish genera (Glossogobius, Oryzias, Dermogenys and Telmatherina) endemic to an ancient island lake (Lake Matano, Sulawesi, Indonesia), using the framework proposed by Schluter (The Ecology of Adaptive Radiation, Oxford University Press, 2000). We demonstrate common ancestry and rapid divergence in one genus (Telmatherina) based on 560 bp of 16S sequence data. We found higher levels of variation in feeding-related traits (N = 8) for Telmatherina relative to the other genera, while no differences were found for sexual display traits (N = 8) or neutral morphological traits (N = 8). Telmatherina also had the highest number of distinct colouration patterns among the four genera. These data, combined with the very low productivity of the lake, are indicative of selection driving adaptive radiation. The morphometric divergence in the Telmatherina likely results from selection acting on feeding traits in this low productivity lake, leading to trophic specialization among closely related morphotypes. These results provide indirect but compelling data supporting the adaptive radiation of Telmatherina in this system.

AB Physiological, anatomical, and developmental features of the crocodilian heart support the paleontological evidence that the ancestors of living crocodilians were active and endothermic, but the lineage reverted to ectothermy when it invaded the aquatic, ambush predator niche. In endotherms, there is a functional nexus between high metabolic rates, high blood flow rates, and complete separation of high systemic blood pressure from low pulmonary blood pressure in a four-chambered heart. Ectotherms generally lack all of these characteristics, but crocodilians retain a four-chambered heart. However, crocodilians have a neurally controlled, pulmonary bypass shunt that is functional in diving. Shunting occurs outside of the heart and involves the left aortic arch that originates from the right ventricle, the foramen of Panizza between the left and right aortic arches, and the cog-tooth valve at the base of the pulmonary artery. Developmental studies show that all of these uniquely crocodilian features are secondarily derived, indicating a shift from the complete separation of blood flow of endotherms to the controlled shunting of ectotherms. We present other evidence for endothermy in stem archosaurs and suggest that some dinosaurs may have inherited the trait.

AB Questions: 1. To what extent does light availability differ among fen plant communities? 2. To what extent does light coincide with productivity and moisture gradients? 3. Does light act as an important environmental filter in natural and transformed riparian landscapes?
   Location: Current data from the Biebrza Valley, NE Poland; literature data from the Trebon area, Czech Republic and four sites in the western and southern Netherlands.
   Methods: Relative light intensity (RLI) was measured in vertical profiles, next to vegetation releves accompanied by measurements of above-ground biomass, summer groundwater level, N and P content in vegetation, pH and soil redox potential. Data derived from literature included profiles of RLI, biomass and vegetation records. Relationships between RLI and biomass and between species distribution, RLI and other variables were examined by regression analysis and CCA. Four traits were analysed: ability to spread clonally, seed weight, maximum height of adults and time of commencement of flowering.
   Results: RLI at ground level varied from <1% in reed beds and tall herb meadows to >60% in sedge-moss communities and litter meadows. RLI was largely determined by the standing crop and explained a large part of variation in species occurrence. The combinations of analysed functional traits were constrained by the communities' light profiles.
   Conclusion: Light availability is related more closely to site fertility than to hydrological regime. This confirms that hydrological regime and productivity should be analysed separately with regard to their effect on species distribution in wetlands. Limited light availability seems the major environmental control of the distribution of low growing and late flowering species.

AB 1. Comparative studies of distinct, but not ecologically isolated, systems such as lakes and streams may improve our understanding of the importance of ecological linkages in aquatic ecosystems.
   2. In this study we compared the macroinvertebrate benthos of stony habitats in Swedish lakes and streams. Community composition was used to evaluate zoogeographic patterns and functional feeding guilds were used to identify mechanisms potentially affecting such patterns.
   3. Stream communities were generally more diverse and species-rich and had a higher proportion of grazers, shredders and passive-filter feeders than lakes. Lake communities had a higher proportion of predators and collector-gatherers. Of the 10 most common taxa, only Leptophlebia mayflies, clams (Sphaeriidae) and the isopod Asellus aquaticus were recorded in both lakes and streams.
   4. Among-site variance in macroinvertebrate communities accounted for by regional-scale variables was low (6.4% for lakes and 10.1% for streams), compared with that by local-scale variables (21% for lakes and 37.6% for streams). For lakes, the among-site variance in macroinvertebrate communities was best explained by habitat-scale characteristics followed by ecosystem, riparian, catchment, geographic position and ecoregion. For streams, the variance in macroinvertebrate communities was best explained by ecosystem characteristics followed by habitat, catchment, riparian, ecoregion and geographic position.
   5. Conspicuous differences in spatial pattern were revealed between lakes and streams. For lakes, the most unequivocal differences in community composition and function occurred at the transition zone between the mixed forests in the south and the boreal coniferous forests in the north. Surprisingly, streams did not respond as strongly to profound landscape-level differences in climate and vegetation cover.
   6. The spatial differences noted between macroinvertebrate communities of lakes and streams may be because of differences in retention of detrital matter. Our findings imply that detrital inputs are qualitatively similar, but that the retention and processing of coarse particulate organic matter was presumably higher in lake littoral regions than in stream riffle habitats.
   7. Although our findings support the conjecture that species distribution is determined fundamentally by conditions prevailing at the local-scale, regional factors such as land use/type and the role of history were important and seemingly act as strong determinants of large-scale patterns in biodiversity.

AB 1. Many natural ecosystems are heterogeneous at scales ranging from microhabitats to landscapes. Running waters are no exception in this regard, and their environmental heterogeneity is reflected in the distribution and abundance of stream organisms across multiple spatial scales.
   2. We studied patchiness in benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and functional feeding group (FFG) composition at three spatial scales in a boreal river system. Our sampling design incorporated a set of fully nested scales, with three tributaries, two stream sections (orders) within each tributary, three riffles within each section and ten benthic samples in each riffle.
   3. According to nested ANOVAS, most of the variation in total macroinvertebrate abundance, abundances of FFGs, and number of taxa was accounted for by the among-riffle and among-sample scales. Such small-scale variability reflected similar patterns of variation in in-stream variables (moss cover, particle size, current velocity and depth). Scraper abundance, however, varied most at the scale of stream sections, probably mirroring variation in canopy cover.
   4. Tributaries and stream sections within tributaries differed significantly in the structure and FFG composition of the macroinvertebrate assemblages. Furthermore, riffles in headwater (second order) sections were more variable than those in higher order (third order) sections.
   5. Stream biomonitoring programs should consider this kind of scale-dependent variability in assemblage characteristics because: (i) small-scale variability in abundance suggests that a few replicate samples are not enough to capture macroinvertebrate assemblage variability present at a site, and (ii) riffles from the same stream may support widely differing benthic assemblages.

AB Two years of fish assemblage data from 28 sites in the Wabash River Indiana, were examined for relationships with environmental variables using a multivariate approach, correspondence analysis. Upstream sites had lower mean daily discharge and lower coefficient of variation of daily discharge when compared to downstream sites. Although the fish assemblage changed along this 230-km river distance gradient, patterns were in contrast to the patterns in streams with unaltered flow regimes. We compared functional variables of fish species (species traits that describe habitat, trophic, morphological, and tolerance characteristics) by examining the proportion of their occurrences along the hydrological variability gradient (upstream downstream). The general pattern showed assemblages from hydrologically stable (upstream) sites had higher proportions of generalist species that tend to occur in small to medium streams, prefer fast current velocities, generally occur over rocky, gravel, and sand substrates, and have low silt tolerance. In addition, there was a pattern relating the hydrological/longitudinal regime and the overall morphology of species: species with higher caudal peduncle/caudal fin ratios and more fusiform body shapes occurred in higher proportion in upstream sites.

AB Stream invertebrate communities are the product of multiple-scale habitat filters, and a major goal in community ecology is to determine which scales most influence the relationships between habitat and community structure. We analyzed the relationships between habitat and the functional structure of invertebrate communities at 3 spatial scales (microhabitat, stream reach, basin), using 264 samples collected from 38 stream reaches in 2 basins in France. The habitat was described in terms of hydraulic conditions (Froude number), substrate size, and benthic particulate organic matter. The functional structure of the invertebrate communities was described using 60 categories of 12 biological traits. Relationships between habitat and traits were significant for 96 of 180 tests (r(2) less than or equal to 26%) at the microhabitat scale (within reaches). Relationships between habitat and traits were significant for 46 of 180 tests (r(2) less than or equal to 34%) at the reach scale (within basins), and the effects of habitat variables on traits did not differ between the 2 basins. Invertebrate traits differed between basins in 34 of 60 trait categories (r(2) less than or equal to 62%). Relationships between habitat and traits were consistent between the microhabitat and reach scales for all traits except body flexibility, number of reproductive cycles/y, and respiration patterns. At both scales, maximum size, body form, mode of attachment to the substrate, feeding habits, reproduction, lifespan, and strategies of dissemination were significantly correlated with habitat variables, especially hydraulics. These results illustrate adaptation to habitat characteristics in terms of resistance to drag and foraging strategies. However, overall differences between basins were inconsistent with patterns observed at smaller scales. In summary, the functional variability of invertebrate communities in stream reaches depended largely on microhabitat filters but also on other filters prevailing at the reach or larger scales.

AB Studies of phenotypic plasticity have emphasized the effect of the environment on the phenotype, but plasticity can also be used as a tool to study the functional significance of key traits. By inducing variation in phenotypes and testing quantitative models that predict performance based on biological mechanisms, we can develop functionally general models of performance. Pumpkinseed sunfish from lakes with high snail availability have large levator posterior muscles (which are used to crush snail shells), whereas fish from lakes with few snails have relatively small muscles. Here we: (1) quantify differences in the feeding ability of an ontogenetic series of pumpkinseed from two populations; and (2) evaluate whether a biomechanical model can resolve the observed ontogenetic and between-population variation in feeding ecology. Mass, but not length, of the levator posterior muscle in fish from Three Lakes (a lake rich in snails) was greater than for comparably sized fish from Wintergreen Lake (a lake with few snails). Handling times were shorter, crushing strengths were 71% greater, and foraging rate (snail tissue mass consumed per time) and the fraction of thick-shelled snails in the diet were approximately 100% greater for fish from Three Lakes compared to comparably sized fish from Wintergreen. These between-lake differences were not significant after adjusting for variation in pharyngeal morphology, suggesting that the biomechanical model of snail crushing resolved observed ontogenetic and population-level variation in the feeding ecology of pumpkinseed.

AB Empirical studies investigating the role of species diversity in sustaining ecosystem processes have focused primarily on terrestrial plant and soil communities. Eighteen representative studies drawn from post-1999 literature specifically examined how changes in biodiversity affect benthic ecosystem processes. Results from these small-scale, low-diversity manipulative studies indicate that the effects of changes in biodiversity (mostly synonymous with local species richness) are highly variable over space and time and frequently depend on specific biological traits or functional roles of individual species. Future studies of freshwater and marine ecosystems will require the development of new experimental designs at larger spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, to successfully integrate field and laboratory studies, the derivation of realistic models and appropriate experiments will require approaches different from those already used in terrestrial systems.

AB Background: Unravelling the path from genotype to phenotype, as it is influenced by an organism's environment, is one of the central goals in biology. Gene expression profiling by means of microarrays has become very prominent in this endeavour, although resources exist only for relatively few model systems. As genomics has matured into a comparative research program, expression profiling now also provides a powerful tool for non-traditional model systems to elucidate the molecular basis of complex traits.
   Results: Here we present a microarray constructed with similar to4500 features, derived from a brain-specific cDNA library for the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni ( Perciformes). Heterologous hybridization, targeting RNA to an array constructed for a different species, is used for eight different fish species. We quantified the concordance in gene expression profiles across these species ( number of genes and fold-changes). Although most robust when target RNA is derived from closely related species (< 10 MA divergence time), our results showed consistent profiles for other closely related taxa (similar to 65 MA divergence time) and, to a lesser extent, even very distantly related species (> 200 MA divergence time).
   Conclusion: This strategy overcomes some of the restrictions imposed on model systems that are of importance for evolutionary and ecological studies, but for which only limited sequence information is available. Our work validates the use of expression profiling for functional genomics within a comparative framework and provides a foundation for the molecular and cellular analysis of complex traits in a wide range of organisms.

AB Ranunculus peltatus Schrank is an aquatic macrophyte spreading in northeastern France. As with other Ranunculus species, its growth demonstrates considerable plasticity. A preliminary understanding of its development and precise adaptive strategy is possible through functional ecology. The present study took morphological traits into account in order to analyse R. peltatus' development and morphological plasticity in relation to environmental parameters. During the five-month growing season, field measurements of ten different morphological traits were performed monthly at twelve sampling sites presenting various physical and chemical characteristics. Three overall growth stages occurred between April and August 2000: a stage of elongation of the main stem, a stage of branching and flowering and a stage of decline associated with vegetative dispersion. The sampling sites were defined according to environmental parameters and divided into three groups corresponding to three morphologically different R. peltatus populations. Plants in upstream, nutrient-poor, undisturbed sites were small and achieved little sexual reproduction. Plants in nutrient-rich, undisturbed sites had long shoots and were branched. Plants in weakly shaded, disturbed sites were small but produced many flowers. Correlations between morphological traits and environmental parameters showed significant relationships between chemical parameters and some characteristic vegetative growth traits. Physical environmental parameters were found to be less well correlated with morphological traits than the chemical parameters. The phenology and morphological plasticity of R. peltatus confer competitive advantages that could explain its ability to spread in some circumstances. Finally, the previous classification of R. peltatus as a Grime CSR species is discussed in relation to its plasticity. According to its morphological characteristics, R. peltatus tended indeed to adopt a C-strategy in nutrient-rich undisturbed sites, a S-strategy in nutrient-poor undisturbed sites and a R-strategy in disturbed sites.

AB Ecological genetics is increasingly recognized as critical to understanding interactions among organisms and ecosystem processes. Using a common garden with pure and hybrid cottonwood trees of known genotype, two years of field surveys, and a cafeteria feeding experiment, we link introgression of Fremont genetic markers, condensed tannins (a genetically based plant trait), and foraging by beavers. These data support two major arguments. First, hybridization is an important mechanism for the transmission of ecologically functional traits. Second, links between a genetically based plant trait in a dominant riparian-forest,tree species and the foraging behavior of beavers, an ecosystem engineer, emphasize that genetically based plant traits can directly and indirectly link population, community, and ecosystem processes.

AB 1. The application of functional ecology models to aquatic plants often relies on morphological and life-history traits which may reflect, in part, the phenotypic plasticity displayed by aquatic plants. The present study was designed to evaluate the use of physiological traits, such as nutrition patterns, to describe aquatic plant strategies along a gradient of increasing resource availablity.
   2. Taking phosphorus (P) as an example, nutrition-use efficiencies were evaluated in five species, through the P-content in plant tissues, the variations in P-content according to nutrient availability and the perenniality of P-storage. Plasticity in P-storage was also investigated in Ranunculus peltatus, a morphologically highly plastic species.
   3. In 2001, P-content was analysed in Callitriche hamulata, C. obtusangula, C. platycarpa, Elodea nuttallii and R. peltatus tissue samples. These five species were sampled at nine different sites in streams along an increasing resource gradient in the Northern Vosges Biosphere Reserve (NE France). Variations of P-content in the roots, stems and dissected and floating leaves of R. peltatus were also studied.
   4. Only C. platycarpa and R. peltatus were found to occur in low nutrient availability conditions. Callitriche hamulata, C. obtusangula and E. nuttallii were restricted to mesotrophic and eutrophic sites. The highest nutrient-use efficiency was found for E. nuttallii which was able to adapt its P-storage to varying resource availabilities. Ranunculus peltatus was able to store high concentrations of P, but its P-integration within the vegetative structure was less efficient under eutrophic conditions. Callitriche spp. appeared to have relatively low nutrient-use efficiencies, although C. obtusangula displayed a high P-content. While P was stored preferentially in roots in R. peltatus populations occurring in nutrient-rich sites, there was no particular P-storage organ for populations from nutrient-poor sites.
   5. On the basis of P-usage, R. peltatus and E. nuttallii presented competitor traits, C. hamulata and C. platycarpa displayed stress-tolerant nutrient signatures and for C. obtusangula, ruderal or competitor characteristics dominated. The use of physiological traits, such as nutrition patterns, may provide valuable, complementary information about aquatic plant strategies, independent from the influence of morphological trait plasticity often displayed by these plants.

AB Plant palatability plays an important part in the fitness of species and is therefore regarded as a key functional trait. The aim of this study was to relate the palatability of aquatic macrophytes to their distribution in riverine wetlands differing in their exposure to spate flood disturbances. Thirty-three former channels of the Rhone River Basin (eastern France) were characterized in terms of flood-disturbance level. Nutrient richness was also measured to eliminate its potential confounding effect. The coverage of 40 macrophyte species was recorded in these wetlands, and their palatability was assessed through laboratory feeding trials using a generalist consumer, the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. The consumption rate of L. stagnalis ranged from 3.9 mg (.) g(-1) (.) d(-1) (for Hottonia palustris) to 137.9 mg (.) g(-1) (.) d(-1) (for Sagittaria sagittifolia) and was used as a palatability index. Plant palatability was unrelated to the nutrient richness of sites but was positively correlated with their flood-disturbance level. However, the strength of this correlation decreased as nutrient richness increased. These results suggest that spate floods promote functional diversity in riverine wetlands, allowing the persistence of the most palatable plant species otherwise eliminated by herbivores, especially in nutrient-poor habitats.

AB Flooding affects the abundance and distribution of plant species worldwide. Many plants are damaged or even killed by flooding events, due to the associated oxygen deprivation in cells. Stimulated shoot elongation is an important adaptive mode that can restore contact of leaves with the atmosphere above the water surface. This strongly improves inward diffusion of oxygen and the rate of photosynthesis. Fast elongation of submerged petioles of the model plant Rumex palustris involves the integrated action of the plant hormones ethylene, auxin, gibberellin, and abscisic acid. The closely related Rumex acetosa is unable to switch on petiole elongation when submerged. In a comparative study of these two Rumex species, we found that the response to the gaseous phytohormone ethylene, which accumulates in plant tissues during submergence, explains their contrasting elongation behavior. In order to study the importance of this shoot elongation response in the distributional patterns of plants in natural floodplains, we quantified the ethylene-induced elongation response of 22 plant species occurring in the Rhine River floodplain. These results were compared with the results of a multivariate analysis based on 84 vegetation surveys performed in the same area. The species compositions of the surveys were grouped along two environmental gradients: flooding duration and soil dehydration after the floodwater subsided. If we superimpose the ethylene-induced elongation capacity on these vegetation data, it becomes clear that the capacity to elongate upon exposure to ethylene positively correlates with flooding duration and negatively with soil dehydration. Based on this analysis, we conclude that the capacity to elongate is an important selective trait in field distribution patterns of plants in flood-prone environments. Fast shoot elongation under water seems to be a favorable trait only in environments with shallow and prolonged flooding events, while costs associated with this response prevent its expression in sites with deep floods, sites with floods short in duration, or in sites in which flood water recedes rapidly. The approach outlined in this paper may be more widely applicable in ecological studies that aim to understand the functional relationship between plant traits and species distributions along environmental gradients.

AB Predators can have a large influence on their prey through induced changes in prey phenotype. Such "nonlethal" predator effects have been abundantly demonstrated empirically in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. But the extent to which changes in species traits alter short-term responses such as growth rate or probability of survival is not clear. Here we develop models to examine the nonlethal effects of predators on prey growth. Our analyses illustrate how the nonlethal effects of predators on individual prey growth depend on environmental context; e.g., factors such as focal species density, competitor density, resource dynamics, and the timescale over which the interactions occur. This context dependence arises because of complex interactions of three mechanisms; (1) the direct negative effect of induced reduction in foraging rates, which is opposed by (2) the potential positive effects of reductions in intra- and interspecific competition, and (3) resource responses to reduced foraging. We present new empirical work, and review previous work, on larval-anuran growth that is in general support of model predictions. The framework presented here can serve to facilitate the design and interpretation of experimental results and predict how the nonlethal predator effect on prey growth in natural systems will vary over time and space.

AB Nine leaf traits (area, fresh weight, dry weight, volume, density, thickness, specific leaf area (SLA), dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen content (LNC)) from ten plant species at eight sites in southern mediterranean France were investigated in order to assess their variability along a climatic gradient and their ranking congruency power. After examination of trait correlation patterns, we reduced the nine initial leaf traits to four traits, representative of three correlation groups: allometric traits (dry weight), functional traits (SLA and dry matter percentage) and Leaf Thickness. We analysed the variability of these four leaf traits at species and site level. We observed that between species variation (between 64.5 for SLA and 91% for LDMC) is higher than within species variation. Allowing a good congruency of species ranking assessed by spearman rank correlation () and a good reallocation of individuals to species by discriminant analysis. A site level variability (between 0.7% for Dry weight and 6.9% for SLA) was identified and environmental parameters (altitude, temperature, precipitation, nitrogen, pH) were considered as probable control factors. We found significant correlation between SLA, LDMC and the average minimum temperature (respectively r=0.87 and r=-0,9) and no correlation for the other traits or environmental parameters. Furthermore, we conclude that two leaf traits appear to be central in describing species: specific leaf area (SLA), percentage of dry matter (LDMC. While, SLA and LDMC are strongly correlated, LDMC appears to be less variable than SLA. According to our results the Dry Matter Content (or its reversal Leaf Water Content) appears the best leaf trait to be quantified for plant functional screening. Leaf thickness appeared to be rather uncorrelated with other leaf traits and show no environmental contingency; its variability could not have been explained in this study. Further studies should focus on this trait.

AB The Cryptasterina group of asterinid sea stars in Australasia comprises cryptic species with derived life histories. C. pentagona and C. hystera have planktonic and intragonadal larvae, respectively. C. pentagona has the gonochoric, free-spawning mode of reproduction with a planktonic lecithotrophic brachiolaria larva. C. hystera is hermaphroditic with an intragonadal lecithotrophic brachiolaria, and the juveniles emerge through the gonopore. Both species have large lipid-rich buoyant eggs and well-developed brachiolariae. Early juveniles are sustained by maternal nutrients for several weeks while the digestive tract develops. C. hystera was reared in vitro through metamorphosis. Its brachiolariae exhibited the benthic exploration and settlement behavior typical of planktonic larvae, and they attached to the substratum with their brachiolar complex. These behaviors are unlikely to be used in the intragonadal environment. The presence of a buoyant egg and functional brachiolaria larva would not be expected in an intragonadal brooder and indicate the potential for life-history reversal to a planktonic existence. Life-history traits of species in the Cryptasterina group are compared with those of other asterinids in the genus Patiriella with viviparous development. Modifications of life-history traits and pathways associated with evolution of viviparity in the Asterinidae are assessed, and the presence of convergent adaptations and clade-specific features associated with this unusual mode of parental care are examined.

AB The shoreline vegetation of Lake Nubia in Sudan was studied by means of morphological characteristics and functional traits of plants established-phase as published in literature reviews. The 57 species recorded in 83 sampling sites were classified according to 15 morphological traits into six Plant Functional Types (PFTs), using Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the homogeneity of these groups in terms of their traits. The resulting PFTs were related to the physicogeographical variables measured (soil texture, soil moisture, soil thickness and elevation) using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The ratios in occurrences of the functional types were calculated per each moisture segment, and can be used as an indicator of the shoreline dynamics.

AB 1. The application of environmental policy and legislation across large-scale administrative units creates a growing need for standard tools to assess and monitor the 'ecological health' of rivers, a requirement that can be achieved through the description of ecological functions of lotic invertebrate species in river communities.
   2. To assess alternative metrics, we tested how the functional structure (described by 14 biological traits) of invertebrate communities in 190 large river reaches differed with respect to differences in taxonomic resolution (species, genus, family), taxa weighting of traits (raw abundance, ln-transformed abundance, presence-absence data) and consideration of alien species (inclusion or exclusion), and how these differences influenced the potential of functional descriptions to discriminate river reaches across a gradient of multiple human impacts.
   3. Functional descriptions derived at the level of species, genera and families were very similar, whereas functional descriptions derived from raw abundances differed significantly from those derived from both ln-transformed abundances and presence-absence data. Functional descriptions after the exclusion of alien species differed considerably from those including alien species.
   4. Generally, the functional descriptions significantly discriminated river reaches according to the level of human impact. Taxonomic resolution scarcely influenced the discrimination of impact levels, whereas the use of raw abundances decreased impact discrimination in comparison with ln-transformed abundances and presence-absence data. Exclusion of alien species also decreased discrimination of impact levels.
   5. When considered separately, individual biological traits describing maximal size, number of descendants per reproductive cycle, number of reproductive cycles per individual, life duration of adults, reproductive method, parental care, body form and feeding habits had the highest potential to discriminate the level of human impact.
   6. Our findings indicate that genus or perhaps family identifications are sufficient for large-river biomonitoring using invertebrate traits. Although raw abundances could provide a better discrimination of low levels of human impact, presence-absence data should be sufficient to discriminate functional community changes caused by elevated levels of human impact across Europe.

AB Functional and structural leaf traits of Quercus ilex seedlings originated from parent plant acorns from three different localities in Italy were studied. Acorns from three different localities along a gradient from the north to the south of Italy: Nago (site A) in the Garda Lake region at the northernmost limit of holm oak distribution area in Italy, Castelporziano near Rome (site B), at the centre of the distribution area, and Frassanito near Otranto (site C), in a drier area in the south of Italy. Morphological and anatomical leaf traits differed between the provenances with a higher leaf mass area, total leaf thickness and the ratio of palisade to mesophyll thickness in the driest provenance (C seedlings). These traits gave C seedlings a higher water use efficiency, relative water content at predawn and photosynthetic rates than the other provenances in high air temperature conditions. The smaller leaf area of A seedlings seemed to have a higher photosynthetic capacity in low air temperature conditions than B and C seedlings. Growth analysis underlined a higher shoot relative growth rate in B seedlings explaining the highest shoot length and leaf number per shoot. The plasticity index [sensu Valladares et al. (2000) Ecology 81:1925-1936] for physiological traits of the seedlings was higher than morphological and anatomical traits, but the largest differences in plasticity among ecotypes were found for morphological and anatomical traits. The ecotypes of Q. ilex studied here seemed to integrate, at leaf level, functions of growth activity, morphology and physiology related to the climate of the original provenance.

AB Theoretical and empirical studies in community ecology often simplify their study system by lumping together species on the basis of trait similarities ( e. g., their taxonomy, resource or microhabitat usage) and then assume species sharing similar traits are functionally similar. To date, no study has directly tested whether species more similar with respect to any of these traits are more similar in their functional effects on population or ecosystem processes. In this study, we examined the association between traits and functional effects of six different aquatic predatory vertebrates. We demonstrated that functional similarity across multiple response variables was not correlated with trait similarity, but differences in trait values were associated with significantly different effects on individual response variables. The exact relationship between species traits and functional effect of predators, however, was different for each response variable. Using traits to predict functional similarity among species may be useful when considering individual response variables, but only if it is known which traits have the greatest influence on the response variable of interest. It is doubtful that any one scheme will predict the functional similarity of species across a diverse array of response variables because each response will likely be strongly influenced by different traits.

AB Both Changium smyrnioides Wolff and Chuanminshen violaceum Shen et Shan are monotypic species of the family Umbellaceae. They have narrow distribution areas and can only be found in the Yangtze River basin in China. Changium is distributed from the east to middle subtropical zone of China, and Chuanminshen from the middle to the west; they almost meet in the middle of the Yangtze basin. Because the climate varies from humid to semi-humid, an experiment was carried out to find out the two species' demand for soil water and analyze their niche separation by determining changes in their physio-ecological and structural traits in response to different soil water statuses. Results showed that the two species have similar structural characters and functional intensity. Diurnal variations, daily mean values, and relationships of irradiation and temperature to P-N, E and WUE among the three treatments indicate that Chuanminshen has more tolerance to drought than Changium. Changes in morphological traits also suggest that Changium adapts to medium to wet soil conditions while Chuanminshen adapts to drought soil conditions. The differences in the adaptation of physiological and morphological traits to the water environment should be part of the reason these two species have become geographically vicarious species. The results indicate that, at least, the mechanism and the approach to conservation for the two species are similar.

AB Assessment of geographical patterns in fluctuating asymmetry (small, random differences between sides of bilateral characters) among populations shows promise as a tool to resolve the relative biomechanical importance of traits, in addition to being a possible indicator of habitat quality. We used 115 endemic freshwater populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands), British Columbia, Canada, to explore the degree of concordance between geographical variation of asymmetry in a predator defense structure (bony lateral plates) and geographical variation in several indirect measures of predation regime as well as several abiotic habitat variables. We found a geographical cline in the population frequency of lateral plate asymmetries, with reduced asymmetry in the southern clear-water regions of the archipelago characterized by long reaction distances and greater chance of capture by predators, and elevated asymmetry in the northern stained-water regions with poor visibility and low chances of capture. Lateral plate asymmetry was strongly correlated with expression of several defensive armor traits, including total plate numbers among populations, mean cross-sectional diameter of stickleback with the dorsal and pelvic spines erect, and mean degree of overlap between the plates and spine supports. There were no significant correlations between frequency of asymmetric fish and any of our abiotic habitat variables. Stickleback with structural plate asymmetries had fewer trout-induced scars than symmetric fish in the significant majority of populations, and there was a decrease in structural plate asymmetry with age in stained-water habitats, suggesting that trout predators may be selectively removing asymmetric fish in some lakes. This study provides evidence that geographical variation in developmental stability of threespine stickleback, as seen in the frequencies of asymmetry, reflects differences among populations in the importance of structural defenses to fitness rather than differences in habitat quality, and that asymmetry may be a target of selection by predators in wild populations.

   2. Functional traits driving the performance of phytoplankton species reflect important processes such as growth, sedimentation, grazing losses and nutrient acquisition.
   3. This paper presents an objective, mathematical way of assigning PFTs and measuring FD. Ecologists can use this new approach to investigate general hypotheses [e.g. the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), the insurance hypothesis and synchronicity phenomena] as, for example, in its original formulation the IDH makes its predictions based on FD rather than species diversity.

AB Phytoplankton seasonal and long-term succession can be described and functionally classified by associations similar as in terrestrial vegetation studies. Such a concept has to include 'climax' into pelagic succession which in turn leads to the question to what extent steady state assemblages occur and if during periods of dynamic equilibrium can be identified. Here we explore the situation with respect to the above question for deep, nutrient poor, alpine lakes in Austria. We first track the long-term development of phytoplankton biomass, their taxonomic structure and their relation to total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a as predictors of trophic state over the past 35 years. We then analyse this data set for coherent algal associations which can be ascribed to trait separated functional groups according to Reynolds et al. (2002). A three year period of stable environmental conditions has then be extracted from the progression of trophic state indices, having similar dominating species each year. These years were finally analysed for steady state conditions according to definitions given in Sommer et al. (1993). During thermal stratification, achievement of an equilibrium could be ruled out although coexistence of several dominating species lasted for several weeks. Habitat templates were constructed from environmental variables prior to biomass peaks for two species important in summer assemblages, the dinoflagellate Ceratium hirundinella and the diatom Fragilaria crotonensis. In summary, functional groups proved to be a valid and useful concept to describe species succession of phytoplankton in deep alpine lakes while pelagic climax is much less clear and steady state conditions were never met.

AB East African cichlids exhibit an extraordinary level of morphological diversity. Key to their success has been a dramatic radiation in trophic biology, which has occurred rapidly and repeatedly in different lakes. In this report we take the first step in understanding the genetic basis of differences in cichlid oral jaw design. We estimate the effective number of genetic factors that control differences in the cichlid head through a comprehensive morphological assessment of two Lake Malawi cichlid species and their F-1 and F-2 hybrid progeny. We estimate that between one and 11 factors underlie shape difference of individual bony elements. We show that many of the skeletal differences in the head and oral jaw apparatus are inherited together, suggesting a degree of pleiotropy in the genetic architecture of this character complex. Moreover, we find that cosegregation of shape differences in different elements corresponds to developmental, rather than functional, units.

AB The early ecophysiological trajectories of angiosperm evolution remain uncertain. This hinders resolution of the possible ecological and physiological catalysts that set the stage for the emergence of our modern flora. One approach for generating hypotheses on the early ecology of angiosperms is to consider the distribution of functional traits among lineages that diverge near the root of the extant angiosperm phylogenetic tree. Using recent phylogenetic results to choose lineages for comparative work, we review and expand on previous studies that examine the ecology and physiology of basal angiosperm lineages. Phylogenetic mapping of functional traits reveals that the basal lineages, Amborella, Austrobaileyales, and some Chloranthaceae, share ecological and physiological traits linked to shady, disturbed, and possibly wet habitats. Traits include low and easily light-saturated photosynthetic rates, absence of leaf palisade cells, guttation resulting from root pressure, as well as small seed sizes. Some Chloranthaceae, such as Ascarina and Hedyosmum, however, recruit seedlings in forest light gaps and other sunny, disturbed habitats. In contrast, the early-diverging water lily clade (Nymphaeales) possesses ecophysiological features linked to aquatic, often sunny habitats, such as absence of a vascular cambium and floating leaves with high photosynthetic rates and palisade mesophyll. On the basis of the phylogenetic distribution of functional traits, we hypothesize that the earliest angiosperms were woody and grew in dimly lit, disturbed forest understory habitats and/or shady stream-side settings. The significance of the hypothesis that angiosperms evolved in shady, disturbed habitats for the origin of their distinctive features, e. g., xylem vessels and carpels, and for patterns of their early diversification is discussed. Finally, we examine how the emerging ecological picture of early angiosperms drawn from living basal lineages can be tested with the fossil record.

AB Large woody debris (wood) plays a number of important roles in forested stream ecosystems. Wood in streams provides habitat and flow, refugia for fish and invertebrates, and is a site of biofilm production that serves as food for grazing organisms. Logs added to streams are rapidly colonized by invertebrates, and this habitat alteration is accompanied by changes in community composition and functional processes. A multiple habitat, qualitative sampling approach was employed to evaluate macroinvertebrate communities associated with wood habitats in 71 stream reaches in central Michigan and southeastern Minnesota, two agricultural regions in the midwestern United States. Macroinvertebrate taxa were classified with respect to behaviour (e.g. sprawler, clinger, swimmer), as well as trophic/feeding characteristics. These traits were used to examine community structure as a function of wood abundance and distribution. Although wood is not abundant in these streams and logs are generally small in size, wood is a very important habitat in both Michigan and Minnesota: 86% and 95% of the total taxa encountered at Michigan and Minnesota study sites,respectively, were found in wood habitats. Differences in regional patterns in the distribution of taxa across habitats were observed between Michigan and Minnesota. These are believed to result from differences in the number of habitat types available, and the dominant substrate composition. Local invertebrate diversity increased in Michigan, but not Minnesota, with the presence of wood habitats in streams. The presence of wood at a site increased the average taxa richness by 15 and 10 taxa in Michigan and Minnesota, respectively. Macroinvertebrate behavioural attributes and functional traits associated with wood habitats suggest that community traits may vary due to both local difference in flow and the location of wood in the channel.

AB East African cichlid fishes represent one of the most striking examples of rapid and convergent evolutionary radiation among vertebrates. Models of ecological speciation would suggest that functional divergence in feeding morphology has contributed to the origin and maintenance of cichlid species diversity. However, definitive evidence for the action of natural selection has been missing. Here we use quantitative genetics to identify regions of the cichlid genome responsible for functionally important shape differences in the oral jaw apparatus. The consistent direction of effects for individual quantitative trait loci suggest that cichlid jaws and teeth evolved in response to strong, divergent selection. Moreover, several chromosomal regions contain a disproportionate number of quantitative trait loci, indicating a prominent role for pleiotropy or genetic linkage in the divergence of this character complex. Of particular interest are genomic intervals with concerted effects on both the length and height of the lower jaw. Coordinated changes in this area of the oral jaw apparatus are predicted to have direct consequences for the speed and strength of jaw movement. Taken together, our results imply that the rapid and replicative nature of cichlid trophic evolution is the result of directional selection on chromosomal packages that encode functionally linked aspects of the craniofacial skeleton.

AB The soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an example of a species in which self-fertilizing hermaphrodites predominate, but functional males continue to persist - allowing outcrossing to persevere at low levels. Hermaphrodites can produce male progeny as a consequence of sex chromosome non-disjunction or via outcrossing with males. Consequently, the genetics of sex determination coupled with the efficiency by which males find, inseminate and obtain fertilizations with hermaphrodites will influence the frequency at which males and outcrossing occurs in such populations. Behavioural and physiological traits with a heritable basis, as well as ecological characters, may influence male reproductive success and therefore sex ratio. Because sex ratio is tied to male reproductive success, sex ratio greatly affects outcrossing rates, patterns of genetic variation, and the ability of natural selection to act within populations. In this paper we explore the determinants of male frequency in C. elegans with a mathematical model and experimental data. We address the role of the genetic machinery of sex determination via sex chromosome non-disjunction on sex ratio and the influence of physiological components of C. elegans' life history that contribute to variation in sex ratio by way of male reproductive success. Finally, we discuss the short-term and long-term factors that are likely to affect sex ratio and breeding system evolution in species like C. elegans.

AB Natural communities can be complex. Such complexity makes it difficult to discern the mechanisms generating community structure. In this paper we review concepts and issues related to linking functional and community studies while also including greater complexity into the experimental realm. These principles are primarily illustrated with case studies involving predation ecology in a freshwater snail-fish-crayfish model system. The system illustrates how predator impacts on prey are mediated by multiple prey traits, correlations between traits, functional trade-offs in predator defence, interactions between predators, and interactions with other community members. We argue for a pluralistic approach to investigating mechanisms of community structure; that is, an approach that integrates many subdisciplines of ecology and evolution. We discuss four main areas that when used together yield important insights on community structure. First, selection gradient analyses formally link functional and community ecology. This formalisation is shown to help identify targets of selection, estimate environment-specific mortality rates, and identify agents of selection in complex communities. Second, we encourage increased focus on emergent community properties (results not predicted based on pairwise species interactions). Third, we emphasise that a community, rather than a web of species interactions, may more profitably be viewed as a network of trait interactions. This trait-centred view makes clear how indirect community effects arise between species that do not interact physically. This perspective also leads to our fourth topic, the integration of phenotypes. Just as populations evolve co-adapted suites of traits, so too should individuals embody integrated trait correlations, termed 'trait integration', rather than randomly assembled collections of phenotypes. All the perspectives mentioned above suggest that investigations should focus on multiple traits and multiple environments simultaneously, rather than singular, atomised components of complex systems.

AB Environmental-induced phenotypic variation in plants is often considered to be a functional response that maximizes fitness in heterogeneous environments. Lycopersicon chilense, a tomato species endemic to Atacama Desert, shows altitudinal phenotypics variations in their natural environments, which could be due to different soil water availabilities. It is hypothesized that (a) seeds coming from populations of different environments, cultivated in the same environment, will have similar phenotypes, if populations are not genetically differentiated, and that (b) the different populations subjected to two drought levels should vary their phenotypic constitution with respect to the control groups. The responses of twenty phenotypic traits to different irrigation levels were studied in nine wild populations of Lycopersicon chilense. Seeds were collected from populations along an altitudinal gradient (from 20 m to 3,075 m), transferred to a common environment and grown under three soil water conditions: low (80 % FC), moderate (40 % FC) and severe (20 % FC). In spite of the climatic differences in their natural habitat the phenotypic responses of plants growing in the same environment was similar in the nine populations. Significant differences among populations were only observed in three out of twenty traits (fruit fresh weight, fruit volume and number of seeds per fruit). Soil water deficit induced a phenotypic response in twelve characters; among these: root dry weight, cover, number of seeting fruits and number of seeds per fruit showed the highest significance. An interaction between population and drought treatment was found only for fresh weight of fruits, fruit volume and number of seeds per fruit. Our data indicate that the phenotypic response does not differ among populations growing under similar environmental conditions. Probably the phenotypic response of L. chilense in their natural habitats is related to physiological and metabolic adjustment rather than genetic variation.

AB The effect of flow and biodiversity on ecosystem functioning was investigated in an estuarine system using in situ benthic chambers. Macrofaunal communities were artificially assembled to manipulate both species richness and functional trait richness. In addition, naturally occurring communities were sampled in order to determine the effect of macrofaunal and sediment disruption. Ecosystem functioning was assessed by measurement of nutrient release (NH4-N) from the sediment, a process essential for primary production. Natural and assembled communities were found to differ significantly, demonstrating the effect of experimental manipulation on the system. Flow was found to have a highly significant effect on ecosystem functioning in both natural and assembled communities in treatments containing macrofauna. No significant difference between static and flow treatments was found in macrofaunal-free controls, indicating that flow generates an effect through promoting changes in bioturbatory activity of the infauna causing greater disruption to the sediment. In assembled communities, functional richness significantly increased ecosystem functioning. Species richness had no influence in assembled communities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper examines modifications of benthic structure and species/traits organization of macroinvertebrate communities affected by various hydro-technical structures in the regulated mountain Trzemesnia stream (southern Poland). The samples of aquatic invertebrates were collected seasonally (6 times) at: (1) one control site with natural substrate and at (2) five sites altered by sills, weirs, and canals during 1999. The stream canals, covered by Cladophora glomerata, were clearly distinguished from the other sites by: highest fauna density (mean of 8.5 10(3) ind. m(-2)), lowest taxa richness (mean number of 4.7 taxa), and lowest diversity (H' = 1.1). The benthic communities consisted mainly of collector-gatherers with the highest contribution in the stream canals (range 87-96%). These results suggest that most types of stream regulations (i.e. stream bed formed by concrete bricks) negatively affect the functional organization of benthic invertebrates (collector-gatherers, predators, and scrapers).

AB Competition between corals and algae is an important process on coral reefs, especially during reef degradation, when abundant corals are often overgrown by benthic macroalgae. Despite the widespread assumption that macroalgae are able to out-compete corals for space, there have been very few experimental studies testing the nature of this interaction. This study compared the effects of a filamentous red alga, Anotrichium tenue, with those of mixed-species, filamentous algal turfs on massive Porites spp. corals on inshore reefs of the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We compared mortality of coral tissue in plots with A. tenue naturally present on live coral tissue, plots in which A. tenue was naturally present but experimentally removed, and plots where mixed algal turfs were naturally present but A. tenue was not. The results indicate that A. tenue killed coral tissue by active overgrowth. Removing the alga removed the effect. In contrast, general, mixed-species algal turfs did not cause any mortality of coral tissue. We suggest that 2 particular traits of A. tenue may facilitate its effects on the corals. First, unlike most filamentous turf species present, it was able to overgrow live coral tissue, perhaps due to allelochemical effects. Second, individual algal filaments trap relatively large amounts of mucus from the corals and of sediment, apparently increasing the damage to underlying coral tissue. Surveys indicated that A. tenue primarily affected massive Porites spp., that overgrowth effects were not site-specific, but that occurrence of infected corals was not widespread. In particular, distribution patterns were not consistent with an effect of terrestrial runoff. This study provides evidence of an exceptionally lethal effect on corals by a single species of filamentous alga, and emphasizes the species-specific nature of coral-algal competitive outcomes, even within a functional group.

AB Two methods traditionally employed to investigate functional diversity in marine benthic ecosystems are relative taxon composition analysis, which interprets changes in the distribution of taxa in terms of the characteristics they exhibit, and trophic group analysis, which investigates differences in feeding mechanisms between assemblages. An alternative approach, biological traits analysis, considers a range of biological traits expressed by organisms to assess how functioning varies between assemblages. This study compares biological traits analysis to the relative taxon composition and trophic group approaches. Biological trait scores were assigned to a range of epibenthic invertebrate taxa from the southern North Sea and eastern English Channel and differences in the relative proportions of these traits were investigated using multivariate methods. The traits important in differentiating stations were attachment, flexibility, body form, mobility, feeding method and life habit. Such assemblages were spatially heterogeneous and there was no obvious distinction between different geographical sectors. This contrasted with the results of the relative taxon composition approach, which showed broad patterns in assemblage distribution in the eastern English Channel and southern North Sea. The biological traits approach provided information on a larger variety of ecological functions than the other techniques and revealed very different relationships between assemblages. It highlighted a greater diversity of assemblage types and was resistant to large-scale biogeographic variations Therefore, it is potentially more useful than the traditional approaches for assessing ecosystem functioning on both large and small scales in benthic environments.

AB Significant correlations were found between herbivorous insect densities and leaf constituent levels across 18 species of understorey shrub in an Australian forest. In general, insect densities were positively correlated with nitrogen and water and negatively correlated with fibre and its constituents (cellulose and lignin), but not all insect guilds were significantly correlated with all leaf constituents. When mature leaf traits were considered, total herbivore density among plant species was most strongly correlated with levels of nitrogen and water. However, when insects were divided into functional guilds, only densities of sucking insects were significantly correlated with mature leaf nitrogen and water, whereas chewing insect densities were significantly correlated with mature leaf fibre and lignin. Low leaf nitrogen levels were recorded for all plants surveyed (among the lowest reported for woody angiosperms), and many plant species also had high levels of leaf fibre. These features are characteristic of Australian forests and have been linked to the generally nutrient- poor soils of this continent. Levels of new leaf nitrogen (% fresh weight) were generally less than or equal to levels of mature leaf nitrogen (% fresh weight). Hence the new leaf preference of several herbivore guilds could not be explained by higher levels of leaf nitrogen. However, significant negative correlations were found between chewer densities and levels of leaf fibre, cellulose and lignin for new and mature leaves, suggesting that higher levels of fibre, cellulose and lignin in mature leaves may be contributing more strongly to the new leaf preference of chewers than leaf nitrogen levels. Despite the significant correlations between leaf constituent levels and the densities of individual guilds, multivariate analyses found no significant relationship between leaf constituent levels and the taxonomic or guild composition of herbivorous insect assemblages.

AB We demonstrate adaptive phenotypic plasticity (PP) in Neochromis greenwoodi, a rock-dwelling haplochromine cichlid from Lake Victoria. Adaptive phenotypic plasticity will enhance the chance of survival and reproduction in changing or novel environments. For rock-dwelling cichlids it may contribute to the success of settlement after migration between rocky outcrops or islands, since newly colonized patches of rock may offer different food regimes and different competitors. In our experiments, we simulated such situations by raising fry on different diets and with different competitors. We chose diet treatments in such a way that we could predict the direction of anatomical changes from functional demands. We expected an indirect effect of interspecific competition: selectively removing one prey-type by the competing species would leave N. greenwoodi with the other. We found the predicted phenotypic responses to food in trophic traits of N. greenwoodi. However, in the current experimental set-up we did not find a differentiating effect of species of competitor. We discuss the possible role of PP in allopatric and sympatric speciation. (C) 2002 The Linnean Society of London.

AB Rivers and river lakes, i.e., lakes that are part of river systems, provide distinctive geomorphic and hydrologic conditions for riparian plants. This variation between lotic and lentic water bodies results in various environments for establishment and growth of plants, but also presents a range of conditions under which plant propagules are transported and deposited along riverbanks and lakeshores. Propagules may be differentially deposited in specific types of fluvial settings depending on their buoyancy. Among riverbanks and lakeshores, we predicted that lakeshores would capture the highest proportion of long-floating seeds, because short floaters will sink before reaching the shoreline. We also predicted that turbulent reaches would receive the highest proportion of short-floating seeds, because these are the sections where buoyancy is least important. Tranquil reaches of rivers were predicted to be intermediate between turbulent reaches and lakes with respect to their efficiency in capturing of long- and short-floating seeds. We tested whether these differences were mirrored in the floras of the different reach types, using reaches of a range of current velocities in 67 sites along a free-flowing river system in northern Sweden. We also related floristic differences to environmental conditions in each of the three reach types (turbulent sections, tranquil sections, and river lakes).
   The proportions of species with long-floating propagules, herbs, and aquatic species were higher along river lakeshores and tranquil reaches than along turbulent reaches, and the opposite was, true for species with short-floating propagules, dwarf shrubs, graminoids, and terrestrial species. The patterns remained when the largest species groups (herbs and graminoids) were tested for floating ability, i.e., the highest proportions of long-floating herbs and graminoids were found in lakes, and the lowest in turbulent reaches; tranquil reaches were intermediate or similar to lakes. Exposure to waves and currents and peat cover explained most of the variation in proportions of species with different floating abilities. We suggest that reach type is a good indicator for predicting the composition of riparian vegetation, especially the proportionate representation of species with various dispersal traits. These results suggest that there is a functional relationship between dispersal traits, channel characteristics, and plant community composition.

AB Biological and procedural factors can influence DNA adduct detection in aquatic organisms. Among them, functional structure and metabolic traits represent major biological determinants for adducts formed by lipophilic pro-mutagenic contaminants. In detecting DNA adducts through the P-32-postlabelling assay, efficiency in DNA purification, digestion, labelling, as well as adduct enrichment and quantification may explain differences between independent studies. Reference DNA adducts have been used to verify some P-32-postlabelling aspects. Data obtained for mussels and fish treated with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and environmentally exposed to genotoxins confirm the above assertions. Although the P-32-postlabelling assay cannot be proposed for routine biomonitoring it appears a reliable and very sensitive index of exposure to genotoxic pollutants in both fish and mollusks.

AB 1. Most research on freshwater (and other) food webs has focused on apparently discrete communities, in well-defined habitats at small spatial and temporal scales, whereas in reality food webs are embedded in complex landscapes, such as river corridors. Food web linkages across such landscapes may be crucial for ecological pattern and process, however. Here, we consider the importance of large scale influences upon lotic food webs across the three spatial dimensions and through time.
   2. We assess the roles of biotic factors (e.g. predation, competition) and physical habitat features (e.g. geology, land-use, habitat fragmentation) in moulding food web structure at the landscape scale. As examples, external subsidies to lotic communities of nutrients, detritus and prey vary along the river corridor, and food web links are made and broken across the land-water interface with the rise and fall of the flood.
   3. We identify several avenues of potentially fruitful research, particularly the need to quantify energy flow and population dynamics. Stoichiometric analysis of changes in C : N : P nutrient ratios over large spatial gradients (e.g. from river source to mouth, in forested versus agricultural catchments), offers a novel method of uniting energy flow and population dynamics to provide a more holistic view of riverine food webs from a landscape perspective. Macroecological approaches can be used to examine large-scale patterns in riverine food webs (e.g. trophic rank and species-area relationships). New multivariate statistical techniques can be used to examine community responses to environmental gradients and to assign traits to individual species (e.g. body-size, functional feeding group), to unravel the organisation and trophic structure of riverine food webs.

AB A collaborative study among three nations (France, Belgium, Netherlands) along the Meuse River developed a consistent approach for collecting and interpreting macroinvertebrate data. Specific mesohabitats were sampled in 16 locations along an 800-km stretch of this lowland regulated river. The objective was to assess the 'river health' using macroinvertebrate communities as indicators of biological and ecological variation in space. The main changes in assemblages were investigated using multimetric and multivariate approaches. The authors examined relationships between faunal variations and both physico-chemical gradients and man-made disturbances. We related species traits to faunal changes and habitat characteristics. Both a gradual shift from a macroinvertebrate assemblage dominated by insects to a community dominated by crustaceans and molluscs and a drastic decrease in biotic index values were observed along the longitudinal gradient. Taxa were distributed according to oxygen, nitrate and ammonium concentrations, pH, conductivity and summer hydraulic conditions. But major faunal differences among sites could not be explained simply by physico-chemical variables. The trait analysis underlined the role of temporary habitats in structuring the summer macroinvertebrate community of sites of the uppermost French sector, which supported the most diverse community in terms of trait combination. Downstream the macroinvertebrate community exhibited a more simple and less stable functional organization. We concluded that the Meuse River exhibited both a high biodiversity and a 'reasonably good' water quality in the upper reaches. Two transition zones highlighted the influence of a high degree of human impact on stream integrity. Regulation for navigation, ship traffic and heavily polluted effluent discharges influenced instream conditions via multiple processes determining a decline of both habitat stability and diversity. However, the rare occurrence of habitat-sensitive species in the lower reaches indicated that a partial recovery of communities may be predicted if restoration and protection of disturbed (especially riparian) habitats are fulfilled.

AB Rhyacophila larvae are aquatic free living Trichoptera, which are commonly considered as carnivorous predators by stream ecologists. We carried out gut contents analyses of each of the five larval instars of four Rhyacophila species, and we found that all larvae started their development (from the first to the first three instars) with a strictly phytophagous diet (diatoms and filamentous algae). The larvae became strictly carnivorous since instar III, IV or V, depending on the considered species. Both young herbivorous and older carnivorous larvae occurred together in the stream, during 10 and 7 months in the two species R. meridionalis and R. occidentalis respectively. Therefore, the functional role of these 'predators' within macroinvertebrate communities should be interpreted more conservatively. Some implications for common ecological approaches are discussed.

AB In several bird species, offspring from larger eggs survive better than birds from smaller eggs, but mechanisms responsible for that pattern have not been clearly identified. Studies of waterfowl have found relationships between egg size, body composition of hatchlings, and duckling growth. Therefore, body composition and growth rate of newly hatched King Eider (Somateria spectabilis) ducklings were measured to assess if traits consistent with higher probability of survival early in duckling varied in relation to egg size. Forty-one King Eider eggs were collected in June and July 1998 from two lakes in the central Canadian Arctic, and artificially incubated, of which 34 hatched. Body composition of 15 hatchlings (<1 day old) was determined, and 19 ducklings were raised in captivity to measure growth rate. Larger eggs produced larger ducklings with absolutely more lipid and protein reserve; absolutely larger breast and leg muscles; higher functional maturity for whole body, leg, and breast muscles; and higher tarsal growth rates than ducklings from small eggs. Such patterns of hatchling composition and growth in relation to increasing egg size may improve likelihood of early survival by improving thermogenesis, reducing time spent as optimal prey size for avian predators, and as shown elsewhere, by enhancing motor performance of ducklings through improvements in foraging efficiency and predator evasion.

AB Dichogamy is one of the most widespread floral mechanisms in flowering plants and is thought to have evolved to reduce interference between pollen import and export within flowers, especially self-pollination. Self-pollination between flowers may also be reduced if dichogamy is synchronous among flowers on an inflorescence. The analysis of dichogamy at both levels requires that the sexual phases of individual flowers be defined functionally in terms of pollen deposition and removal. We conducted morphological and functional analyses to investigate the degree of dichogamy within flowers and the synchronicity of dichogamy between flowers within inflorescences in an emergent. aquatic monocot, flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus). Based on daily observations of the development of marked flowers, data on the schedule of anther dehiscence within flowers, and repeat surveys of floral sex ratios in three populations. individual flowers appear to be strictly protandrous. On average, each flower spends similar to1 d in each of male and female phases with an intervening 1-d neuter phase during which there is no available pollen in anthers and stigmas are not yet exposed to receive pollen. Morphological criteria used to delimit the beginning and end of each of these three sex phases were validated by quantifying the temporal schedule of pollen removal from anthers and pollen deposition on stigmas. Experimental pollinations showed that the morphological changes marking the end of female phase are hastened by pollen deposition. At the umbel level, synchronous development within sequential cohorts of flowers reduced overlap of male and female sexual phases between flowers. On average (+/- 1 SE), 72 +/- 3% of flowers completed their female phase while no other flowers on the same umbel were in male phase. Computer simulations of umbel development showed that this value is significantly higher than expected if the Liming of flower development within umbels was random (30 +/- 1%). Surveys of floral sex ratios in three populations revealed that 87% of umbels were either unisexual male or female at any given time. Pollinators usually visited more than one flower in sequence when foraging on umbels, suggesting that synchronous dichogamy may be an adaptation to avoid geitonogamy. The adaptiveness of both flower- and umbel-level dichogamy is also suggested because both traits are expressed to a lesser extent in obligately clonal, triploid populations, where flowers do not make seeds and hence floral adaptations are not maintained by natural selection.

AB The idea that female mate choice might be adaptive is relatively easy to understand in species with resource-based mating systems in which females gain access to a territory, food, or other forms of parental care from the males with whom they mate. In contrast, the evolution of female mate choice in species exhibiting resource-free mating systems remains controversial. One such species in which males contribute nothing but sperm during mating is the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Here, we examined whether female guppies can obtain information on male fertility (i.e., direct fertility benefits) via cues used during mate choice. Specifically, we examined whether male guppy colour patterns, body size, and mating behaviour signal their functional fertility, that is, their ability to supply a large number of sperm at copulation. We found significant correlations between male phenotype parameters and the number of sperm in male guppies originating from two wild Trinidadian populations. There were, however, significant interpopulation differences with respect to which traits were good predictors of sperm load. In the low-predation Paria River population, larger males and males with relatively more carotenoid colouration had significantly larger sperm loads, but mating behaviour (i.e., sigmoids) and melanin colouration were not good predictors of sperm load. In the high-predation Tacarigua River population, larger males, males that displayed more, and males with less yellow colouration had significantly more sperm, but other colour pattern components (area of orange and black colouration) were not good predictors of sperm load. Overall, our results suggest that there is the potential for direct fertility benefits through mate choice in the promiscuous, non-resource-based mating system of the guppy.

AB 1. The impact of sample preparation, rehydration procedure and time of collection on the determination of specific leaf area (SLA, the ratio of leaf area to leaf dry mass) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC, the ratio of leaf dry mass to fresh mass) of mature leaves was studied in three wild species growing in the field, chosen for their contrasting SLA and LDMC.
   2. Complete rehydration was achieved 6 h after samples were placed into water, but neither of the procedures tested-preparation of samples before rehydration or temperature applied during rehydration-had a significant effect on the final values of SLA or LDMC.
   3. As expected, water-saturated leaves had a lower LDMC than non-rehydrated leaves; more surprisingly, their SLA was also higher. The impact of rehydration on SLA was especially important when the SLA of the species was high.
   4. There was no significant effect of time of sampling on either trait in any species over the time period covered (09.00-16.30 h).
   5. These results suggest that SLA and LDMC obtained on water-saturated leaves (SLA(SAT) and LDMCSAT) can be used for species comparisons. We propose a standardized protocol for the measurement of these traits. This would allow for better consistency in data collection, a prerequisite for the constitution of large databases of functional traits.

AB Specific leaf area (leaf area to dry mass ratio), leaf dry matter content (leaf dry mass to saturated fresh mass ratio) and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) have been proposed as indicators of plant resource use in data bases of plant functional traits.
   We tested whether species ranking based on these traits was repeatable by studying spatio-temporal variations in specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content of water-saturated leaves (SLA(SAT) and LDMCSAT), as well as in LNC, for 57 herbaceous and woody species (or subsets thereof) growing under the Mediterranean climate of southern France.
   Interseason and intersite variations were more pronounced than interannual variations, but species ranking for a given trait remained mostly consistent in space and time. Classifications based on LDMCSAT were generally more repeatable across years and sites, whereas those based on SLASAT were more stable over seasons. LNC usually gave the least repeatable classifications.
   Species rankings were not completely similar for the three traits. Discussion of reproducibility, ease of trait measurement, as well as trait-function relationships led us to propose that measurements of the leaf traits, SLA(SAT) and/or LDMCSAT, were the most suitable in large screening programmes.

AB Nectar-feeding vertebrates respond to variation in nectar sugar content by modulating volumetric intake. In some nectar feeding animals, the intake response to sugar concentration can be accurately predicted from simple mathematical models that rely on knowledge of gut morphology, in vitro rates of sugar digestion, and daily energy expenditures. Because most of the floral nectars consumed by vertebrates are dilute, these animals ingest large amounts of water while feeding. The water turnover rates of hummingbirds feeding on dilute nectar are more similar to those of amphibious and aquatic organisms than to those of terrestrial vertebrates. Dilute nectars can pose osmoregulatory challenges for nectarivores. Nectarivorous birds exhibit renal traits that are well suited to dispose of large water loads and that appear inadequate to produce concentrated urine. Nectar-feeding birds prefer concentrated over dilute sugar solutions. However, the concentration difference that they can discriminate is smaller at low than at high concentration. We hypothesize that this pattern is a consequence of the functional form of intake responses that often results in decelerating sugar intakes with increasing sugar concentration. The diminishing returns in floral attractivity that may result from increased nectar concentration may be one of the reasons why the nectars of hummingbird pollinated flowers are dilute in spite of the preference of birds for higher concentrations. The intake responses of nectar-feeding birds capture the integration of a behavioral response with the physiological processes that shape it. Because the behavior of nectar-feeding birds can have consequences for the plants that they visit, the intake response may also have coevolutionary effects.

AB Young-of-the-Year (YOY) cyprinid recruitment success was investigated annually over a 16-year period (from 1983 to 1998) in relation with the annual hydrological regime in a large regulated river (the Rhone River, France). The annual discharge regime was divided among 3 seasons based on the biological cycle of fishes (wintering, reproduction, and growth periods), and characterised by descriptors of average, high and low flow conditions, and overall variability. Go-inertia analysis revealed two distinct effects of hydrology on YOY recruitment success. The first resulted in a sudden shift in the YOY community organization, and was the consequence of two unpredictable (of extremely high magnitude in regard with the longterm mean value in a given time interval) consecutive floods, in October 1993 (110-year return-flood) and January 1994 (50-year flood). The resulting scouring of the substratum seems to have had a favourable effect on recruitment. The second, weaker effect was only observed in the 5 years after the 1993 and 1994 floods. It revealed the role of seasonality in hydrological conditions, because it separated high and variable discharge during the spawning period (favourable for barbel and bleak) from low discharge during this season (favourable for roach, rudd and nase). The results were consistent with previous knowledge concerning these species, and functional interpretations confirmed general expectations. Our findings support habitat template theories that attribute a major role to environmental variability (including 'disturbance history') in determining community characteristics. Finally, these results provide the first steps for a rational management of seasonal discharge in large regulated streams.

ID HOVERING INSECT FLIGHT; AERODYNAMICS; PROPULSION; FLUID
AB Both kinematics and morphology are critical determinants of performance in flapping flight. However, the functional consequences of changes in these traits are not get well understood. Traditional aerodynamic studies of planform wing shape have suggested that high-aspect-ratio wings generate more force per area and perform more efficiently than low-aspect-ratio wings, but these analyses may neglect critical components of flapping flight such as unsteady fluid dynamics and wing or fin flexion, In this paper, we use an unsteady potential Row analysis that incorporates wing flexion to test predictions of optimal wing shape under varying degrees of unsteady motion and wing flexion, We focus on forward flapping flight and examine the effects of wing/fin morphology and movements on thrust generation and efficiency. We test the model by comparing our predictions with kinematic data derived from the aquatic Right of the ratfish Hydrolagus colliei, Our analyses show that aspect ratio and the proportion of area in the outer one-fifth of the wing can characterize wing shape in terms of aero- or hydrodynamic performance. By comparing the performance of wings that vary in these two parameters, we find that traditional predictions of optimal wing shape are valid only under limited circumstances (when flapping frequency is low, wings are stiff or wings are tapered at the tips), This indicates a complex relationship between locomotor traits and performance and helps explain the diversity of wing kinematics and morphologies observed in nature.

AB East African cichlid fishes have evolved a stunning array of oral jaw morphologies. To better understand the adaptive evolution of this trait, we performed a morphological analysis of the jaws of two closely related species from Lake Malawi that have very different modes of feeding. Labeotropheus fuelleborni forages along the substrate with a "biting" mode of feeding, while Metriaclima zebra feeds in the water column with a "sucking" mode. We analyzed each of the four skeletal elements that make up the oral jaws: the dentary, articular, premaxilla, and maxilla. In addition, we performed the same analysis on the neurocranium, an element closely associated with the oral jaws. We used the thin-plate spline method to quantify morphological differences, which allowed us to relate our results to the functional biology of the species. We find many aspects of shape change that relate directly to the functional design of the cichlid head. The same series of measurements was made on hybrids between Labeotropheus and Metriaclima. For every character, hybrid progeny are statistically different from both parental species. These results suggest an additive mode of action of the alleles responsible for these phenotypes. J. Exp.

According to the results obtained, ALA as a trait is widespread among green and blue-green algae but is expressed to different extents. Experiments on the algae-zooplankters model showed that ALA is a factor facilitating the survival of algae in freshwater communities by promoting the establishment of their trophic and symbiotic relationships with other aquatic organisms. Analyzing the intrapopulation structure of algal cultures associated with zooplankters, it was shown that changes in the ALA of algal clones have adaptive significance, providing for a greater stability of algal populations in biocenoses.

AB Environmental policies increasingly focus on the enhancement of ecological functions across large geographical areas and thus call for biomonitoring tools that assess these functions at large spatial scales. A potential answer to this call would be to use general biological traits of organisms that indicate ecological functions, as such traits will be comparable among communities even across biogeographic regions that differ in their taxonomic composition. Here, we used benthic invertebrates and European running waters as example to illustrate how multiple biological traits could provide a measure for the large-scale biomonitoring of the functional composition of communities. Our measure considered the relative abundance of 63 categories of 11 biological traits (such as size, reproductive and dispersal potential, food and feeding habits) that indicate various ecological functions. Comparing this measure for 10 most natural French reference regions with 37 other most natural regions/stream types scattered across Europe demonstrated an extremely high spatial and temporal stability of the functional composition of natural invertebrate communities at the European scale. Thus, our functional measure corresponds to a fundamental standard for a large-scale biomonitoring tool, which is the stable and reliable indication of the natural reference state across ecoregions that differ more or less in their taxonomic composition. Applying our functional measure to regulated stream sites below dams (in England, Finland and Spain) and to streams receiving sewage inputs (in Wales, Poland and Sardinia) demonstrated highly significant (p < 10(-6)) differences in the functional composition between the human-impacted and the natural reference communities. In addition, some of the trait categories responded in a consistently contrasting way to each of the two types (regulation, sewage) of human impact. Consequently, our measure for the functional composition of invertebrate communities provides a first unified European baseline for future stream and river management: it was stable in the most natural but otherwise very different running water types across Europe, it safely indicated human impact, and it could potentially discriminate specific types of human disturbances. As all living organisms have multiple biological traits, our approach could serve to generate, for other types of communities and ecosystems, a set of large-scale biomonitoring tools that use similar and perhaps even comparable measures for the functional community composition.

AB 1. Using a model (PROTECH-C) that simulates the simultaneous daily growth of eight phytoplankton species, the following hypotheses were tested: (i) for each given set of simulated conditions, the species with the most appropriate trait, as predicted by a functional group classification, should dominate the community; (ii) with removal of this dominant species, the next best-adapted species should dominate and should be from the same, or a close, functional group where available; (iii) a reduction in the inoculum size of the initially dominant species will not prevent its eventual dominance of the community.
   2. For clearer insight into the mechanisms underlying these community processes, a functional group classification based upon species morphology has been used to produce a matrix analogous to Grime's CSR (C, competitor; S, stress tolerator; R, ruderal) paradigm. The effects upon this phytoplankton community of temperature, grazing, limiting light and nutrients over a simulated year were recorded.
   3. The results supported all three hypotheses. It was found that, for a given selective constraint, functional traits provided excellent predictors of the dominant types. Also, under conditions of resource competition, the number of functional groups represented decreased. Competition was greatest within functional groups where niche overlap was high, but one species was always clearly the strongest competitor, i.e. its superiority over its nearest functional competitor was regularly expressed even when the difference in inoculum size was great (1000-fold). These conclusions emphasized the power that trait selection can have in the shaping of communities.

AB Mussel beds in the intertidal of subtropical South America are known to harbour a large number of invertebrates, particularly polychaetes. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the patterns of spatial overlap and coexistence in an assemblage of polychaetes associated with mussel beds in a rocky intertidal habitat on the Pacific coast of Peru. Mussel beds are made up of two zones in the intertidal: the lower, more extensive zone formed by Semimytillus algosus and the upper zone formed by Perumytilus purpuratus, Null models were employed to assess the magnitude of spatial overlap between pairs of taxa encompassing a total of seven taxonomic groups. Two taxa belonging to the same functional group tended to be spatially segregated in the Semimytilus bed: Pseudonereis vs. Halosydna (large free-ranging predators) and Scoloplos vs. Mediomastus (deposit feeders), with further segregating tendencies between Pseudonereis and Mediomastus, and between Halosydna and Scoloplos. Small-sized, free-ranging 'Typosyllis' and the bottom-dwelling scavenging predator Lumbrineris were also spatially associated. Thus, this polychaete assemblage appears to be loosely organised around groupings of taxa which are somewhat different in ecological traits and form mosaic patterns of distribution with reduced overlap within the Semimytilus bed. These relationships were weak to non-existent in the upper, drier Perumytilus habitat where polychaete density was low.

AB It is widely assumed that adaptations to an aquatic lifestyle are so profound as to produce only obvious differences between pinnipeds and the remaining, largely terrestrial carnivore species ("fissipeds"). Thus, comparative studies of the order Carnivora routinely examine these groups independently. This approach is invalid for two reasons. First, fissipeds are a paraphyletic assemblage, which raises the general issue of when it is appropriate to ignore monophyly as a criterion for inclusion in comparative studies. Second, the claim that most functional characters (beyond a few undoubled characteristic features) are different in pinnipeds and fissipeds has never been quantitatively examined, nor with phylogenetic comparative methods. We test for possible differences between these two groups in relation to 20 morphological, life-history, physiological, and ecological variables. Comparisons employed the method of independent contra!:ts based on a complete and dated species-level phylogeny of the extant Carnivora. Pinnipeds differ from fissipeds only through evolutionary grade shifts in a limited number of life-history traits: litter weight (vs. gestation length), birth weight, and age of eyes opening (both vs. size). Otherwise, pinnipeds display the same rate of evolution as phylogenetically equivalent fissiped taxa for all variables. Overall functional differences between pinnipeds and fissipeds appear to have been overstated and may be no greater than those among major fissiped groups. Recognition of this fact should lead to a more complete understanding of carnivore biology as a whole through more unified comparative tests. Comparative studies that do not include monophyletic groups for phyiogenetically based comparative tests should be reconsidered.

AB 1. A field experiment was carried out to determine whether the accumulation of stream invertebrates in refugium patches during high flow disturbances was influenced by the geometric scaling of the patches, i.e. edge to size relationships.
   2. Flow was reduced experimentally by creating artificial flow refugia and comparing invertebrate colonization of refugium and control patches. There were eight sizes of colonization cage (1.5 cm mesh) with surface area/volume quotients (SA/V) which ranged from 1.2 to 0.5. Control cages were open to the flow; artificial refugia were baffled upstream by 0.3 cm mesh to reduce flow. Four, week-long experimental trials were carried out during the winter months in an upland Scottish stream. On two occasions, discharge was high, on two it was low.
   3. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that stream invertebrates accumulate in refugia during high flow disturbances. The density of colonists was higher in refugia than control cages after high discharge for some taxa. There was no difference between treatments for any taxon at low discharge.
   4. The shape of soft-edged microhabitat patches appears to be important in mediating the impact of disturbance in streams. Small refugium patches (high edge to size ratio) appeared to be more efficacious than large patches for taxa that accumulate in refugia during disturbances. Density increased with SA/V in all trials and for all taxa, but the slopes of the lines relating density to SA/V differed between control and refugium patches after disturbance for some taxa.
   5. According to trait-based analysis, taxa that have high mobility or that are vulnerable to high hydraulic forces may be especially dependent upon small flow refugia to maintain population size. Whether movement is by active or passive means is less important.

AB An overview of the eleventh IAP Workshop is presented. Although significant progress has been made in the recognition of the factors governing species selection at differing trophic levels, it is recognised that the ultimate influences of species composition are precedent and stochasticity. No individual species is selected uniquely by a given combination of environmental conditions, although there are functional and morphological traits which pre-adapt some species above others to function preferentially in either oligotrophic or eutrophic conditions. With this in mind, a new set of rules of community assembly is offered.

AB Studies of biodiversity and ecosystem function require to consider the identification level that accurately describes the functional diversity of communities, in terms of their biological traits, at different spatial scales. Therefore, we combined three published data sets of stream macroinvertebrate abundances collected at three spatial scales with a database of functional species traits (e.g. life history, morphology, physiology, and behaviour). We investigated the abundance of taxa and their traits at five levels of taxonomic (from species to class) and three levels of spatial resolution (from local habitat to catchment). We used multivariate analyses and correlations to evaluate the accuracy of community descriptions through the stability of such descriptions, the degree of similarity of site ordinations, and the overall community structure expressed at each taxonomic level. The accuracy of community descriptions based on the abundance of taxa depended on the spatial scale considered. The accurate description of the abundance of taxa required identifications to genera and/or families on the local habitat scale, while species identifications were needed on the catchment scale. In contrast, the accurate description of the abundance of biological traits was achieved by identifications to species, genera, or families on all three spatial scales. Thus, species identifications may not be necessary for future studies on the functional diversity of the stream benthos at different spatial scales.

AB The aim of this paper was to investigate the potential use of biological and ecological traits of macroinvertebrates as indicator systems of quality conditions in freshwater ecosystems. To provide a framework for the trait analysis, a data base was developed; it stored biological information about 472 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa. Twenty-two variables describing biological and ecological traits were resolved into a number of simple attributes. A fuzzy coding procedure was used to describe the link between taxa and variables. Three strategies, using simple descriptive statistics or multivariate ordination techniques, were examined in their abilities to demonstrate some of the characteristics of the environment and to bring out clear information on the rate of changes in habitats. We used the Loire River, France, as a specific example. Like faunal analyses, trait analyses showed that a major change occurred in the community in the upper reaches of the river, but transition zones that were not detected with faunal data alone, were discriminated. They corresponded to differences in combinations of biological and ecological traits of communities and were linked to tributary influences (e.g. the Allier-Loire confluence) or anthropogenic disturbances: dams (Grangent, Villerest) or urban zones (Le Puy, Tours). We concluded that the species trait approach had the potential to evaluate the actual state of ecosystems, to discriminate among different types of human impact, and to develop monitoring tools considering the functional diversity of communities.

AB The main objective of this study was to quantify the relationship between taxonomic and functional parameters of macroinvertebrate assemblages and reach/landscape attributes of agricultural catchment. We aimed to analyse the relation between landscape patchiness and land-water ecotone structure, and their influence on benthic fauna composition, biomass and functional organization. A variety of catchment characteristics: land use patterns, surface geology (e.g. type of soils), elevation, hydrology database were incorporated into a geographical information system (GIS) to evaluate anthropogenic impact on landscape properties. The scenarios of potential transfer of nitrogen load along the gradient of the river valley were elaborated. The assessment of nutrient export focused on identifying the most effective nutrient barriers across spatial scales. The analysis of landscape and reach units demonstrated significant, negative correlations between the rate of nutrient transfer to surface/groundwaters and (i) the length of riparian ecotones, (ii) river width, and (iii) the areas of wetland and forested patches in the catchment. The trophic base (primary producers; CPOM; FPOM) in the stream channel was analysed as a factor modifying the structural and functional organization of macrobenthos. Canopy cover, and the consequent amount of solar input reaching the stream bed, significantly influenced food-related variables: leaf input and algal biomass. The factor that significantly affected food availability, retention and transport of benthic particulate organic matter (BPOM) and amount of chlorophyll a was stream discharge. Higher discharge contributed to low retention of BPOM. To obtain more information about environmental variability (56 variables) and macroinvertebrate functional organization, the entire data matrix was analysed using Principal Component Analysis. A significant correlation was shown in the case of shredder abundance (i) in the low-order station S1, (ii) high canopy cover complexity, and (iii) retention of benthic organic matter. Filtering collectors were significantly associated with the presence of suspended organic matter. Other faunal assemblages, highly related to stream hydraulics factors, were alternative gathering collectors/scrapers, much retained at fourth-order station S3. Stream discharge, depth and chlorophyll a significantly affected the presence of these organisms. This indicated the crucial role of habitat heterogeneity, which was attributable to local conditions (detrital inputs, hydraulics, morphological characteristics), and significantly influenced the trophic structure of biocommunities. In the regulated section of the river (S2) without overhanging vegetation, the abundance of scrapers was significantly correlated with open canopy. Domestic and agricultural impact, evidenced by high nutrient concentrations, significantly reduced species richness (stations S4/S4a). Macroinvertebrate communities were used to detect environmental stress in the river system. Assessment of water quality with biological indices directly revealed human-induced alterations (e.g. land use, lack of riparian vegetation, channelization).

AB Net photosynthesis (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), leaf temperature (LT), transpiration rate (E) and in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence were monitored February 1996-February 1997 in Quercus ilex plants growing in the climax area (Rome) and in the Garda lake region. Photosynthetic activity is an appropriate temperature-dependent functional trait linked to plant metabolism and performance. We employed photosynthesis as a stress temperature indicator. Regression analysis showed that in such regional climatic conditions, net photosynthetic rates were primarily correlated with temperature. The introduction of rainfall in the function did not significantly improve the theoretical prevision, in the range of temperature and rainfall analysed. The favourable leaf temperatures allowing 90-100% of the highest photosynthetic rates were 14-28 degrees C, decreasing over 50% when leaf temperature were respectively below 6 degrees C and over 37 degrees C: the low potential photochemical efficiency of 0.71 PSII (Fv/Fm) at Castelporziano during summer, confirmed the state of stress. Transpiration rates remained high with the increase of leaf temperature in summer, in spite of the 46% decrease of stomatal conductance. Nevertheless, this decrease allowed the maintenance of acceptable Pn rates in stressful conditions. The potential productivity of Q. ilex lied on high peaks of activity during periods of lower evaporative demand and a rapid stomatal response to an increase in air temperature and soil water deficit. Although it is difficult to forecast Q. ilex productivity and plant structure, we may hypothesize its future presence in the Mediterranean Basin by the capability of vegetative activity in a wide range of temperatures, the high stomatal control in stressful conditions, the high plasticity index and water use efficiency (WUE).

AB The objective of this work was to study the drainage basin of a small crater lake whose short tributary runs through pastureland and ponds. The catchment was separated into four morphological units and core sampling was carried out to analyze pedological horizons. Five stations were surveyed along the stream. The water quality was investigated seasonally through both physical and chemical variables (oxygen, pH, temperature, phosphorus, nitrate) and with the French normalised biological index. The analysis of macroinvertebrates was made with regard to the spatial heterogeneity of the streambed and the community structure, then categorized by habitat preferences and functional feeding groups. The land at the top of the catchment area, consisting of hydromorphic soils, was used for cattle breeding. This generated the increase in suspended sediment and nutrients concentration in the water. However, the decrease in nutrients from up to downstream, and the evolution of the benthic communities, indicated an improvement in water quality. The high degree of self-purification in the catchment area may result from the combined action of ungrazed hydromorphic soils, ponds and natural purification of the stream. Moreover, the geomorphological characteristics of the catchment influence physical and chemical variables, as well as the biological traits of the macroinvertebrates. As a consequence, the indices of taxa diversity, weighted according to substrates types, seemed to be the most accurate descriptors of the environmental changes. Thus, the resilience of the aquatic ecosystem may be influenced by the degree of complexity of the watershed geomorphology.

AB 1. Relating species traits to habitat characteristics can provide important insights into the structure and functioning of stream communities. However, trade-offs among species traits make it difficult to predict accurately the functional diversity of freshwater communities. Many authors have pointed to the value of working with groups of organisms as similar as possible in terms of relationships among traits and have called for definition of groups of organisms with similar suites of attributes.
   2. We used multivariate analyses to examine separately the relationships among 11 biological traits and among 11 ecological traits of 472 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa (mainly general. The main objective was to demonstrate (1) potential trade-offs among traits; (2) the importance of the different traits to separate systematic units or functional groupings; and (3) uniform functional groups of taxa that should allow a more effective use of macroinvertebrate biological and ecological traits.
   3. We defined eight groups and 15 subgroups according to a biological trait ordination which highlighted size (large to small), reproductive traits (K to r strategists), food (animal to plant material) and feeding habits (predator to scraper and/or deposit feeder) as 'significant' factors determining the ordination of taxa. This ordination partly preserved phylogenetic relationships among groups.
   4. Seven ecological groups and 13 ecological subgroups included organisms with combinations of traits which should be successively more adequate in habitats from the main channel to temporary waters, and from the crenon to the potamic sections of rivers, and to systems situated outside the river floodplain. These gradients corresponded to a gradual shift from (1) rheophilic organisms that lived in the main channel of cold oligotrophic mountain streams to (2) animals that preferred eutrophic habitats of still or temporary waters in lowlands. The groups with similar ecological traits had a more diverse systematic structure than those with similar biological traits.
   5. Monitoring and assessment tools for the management of water resources are generally more effective if they are based on a clear understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the presence or absence of species groups in the environment. We believe that groups with similar relationships among their species traits may be useful, in developing tools that measure the functional diversity of communities.

AB 1. The methods used to indicate the biological state of streams are often based on taxonomic composition, and the abundance of species or other taxa. This 'taxonomic structure' varies among ecoregions and cannot be applied to wider geographical areas. Therefore, we assessed the species traits of benthic macroinvertebrates from semi-natural reference sites as a potential benchmark for large-scale biomonitoring. Our purpose was to assess the stability of community structure, based on the representation of taxa and of traits, across large gradients of geology (sedimentary to granitic), altitude (65-1982 m), geographical coordinates (0 degrees 48' W to 7 degrees 20' E and 42 degrees 52' to 48 degrees 44' N), stream order (1-5) and slope (0.5-60%).
   2. We used invertebrate abundance data from the 62 most natural French stream sites available. These abundance data served to weight the occurrence of 'biological' traits, such as reproductive characteristics, mobility, resistance forms, food, feeding habits, respiration, and 'ecological' traits, such as preferences for temperature, trophic level, saprobity,, biogeographic distribution, longitudinal zonation, substratum and current velocity.
   3. Multivariate analyses of taxonomic composition demonstrated a clear site gradient from lowlands to uplands and from calcareous to granitic geology. In contrast, community structure based on both biological and ecological traits was stable across environmental gradients.
   4. The frequency distribution of biological traits indicated that the stream benthos of the 'reference sites' had a mixture of categories which confirmed theoretical predictions for temporally stable and spatially variable habitats. A mixture of ecological trait categories also occurred at our reference sites. Thus, semi-natural benthic macroinvertebrate communities are functionally diverse. Moreover, we included an initial application of these traits to a case of slightly to moderately polluted sites to show that the impact of humans significantly changes this natural functional diversity.
   5. Future studies should focus on the potential for various biological and ecological traits to discriminate different human impacts on the benthic macroinvertebrates of running waters, and on the integration of this functional application into a general 'reference-condition' approach.

AB A series of models was developed using functionally-derived variables (mainly based on morphological attributes of freshwater macrophytes) to predict the trophic status of river and associated channel systems. The models were compared with an existing species-assemblage based procedure for predicting British river trophic conditions (the Macrophyte Trophic Ranking scheme, MTR). We compared sites in cooler temperate conditions (in Scotland) and warmer, sub-tropical conditions (in Egypt). In total, we made measurements of 13 traits from > 600 individual plant specimens of 33 species growing at 42 sites (divided into independent input and test site datasets). N status (as annual mean concentration in water of total oxidised nitrogen, TON) was only very poorly predicted by this approach. However, P (as annual mean concentration in water of soluble reactive phosphate, SRP) was better predicted: both by a model based on MTR (r = -0.585, p < 0.001), and by models using functional attributes of the macrophyte vegetation. River Trophic Status Indicator (RTSI) models based on ranked plant functional group relationship to river water P concentrations (RTSIFG), or field-measured trait sets of the plants (RTSITR) could also individually explain up to about 34% of the variation in P, both for the total dataset and for subsets from Egypt or Scotland alone or for high v. low-flow sites. Combining both types of RTSI measure produced the most powerful predictive model (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), explaining just over half the variability in P.

AB 1. Blackfly species richness and community structure were analysed at fifty-six sites in northern Sweden in two seasons. The sites were situated in a wide range of streams and rivers from small springbrooks, bog streams and lake-outlet streams to medium-sized forest rivers and large rivers draining montane regions.
   2. Thirty-nine blackfly species were found, with between two and thirteen species per site. Neither species richness nor abundance could be related to the environmental variables measured.
   3. An analysis of labral fan size of blackflies indicated a clear trend for the prevalence of larvae with small fans in large rivers and larvae with larger fan size in small streams. Similarly, fan size related to current velocities so that large fans were associated with slow current velocities and small fans with high velocities.
   4. A strong relationship existed between species composition and habitat, as seen in ordination by non-metric multidimensional scaling. The relationship found between fan size and habitat size-related variables, such as channel width, depth, velocity and substratum particle size, along with longitude and altitude, in partial least squares regression analysis offered an explanation of the species composition-habitat relationship.
   5. In addition to testing that distributions of blackfly larvae reflect morphological traits, we tested two general hypotheses pertaining to distribution patterns: (a) that blackfly communities show bimodal distributions; and (b) that their distributions are nested. Neither of these two hypotheses was supported by our observations. However, widespread blackfly species were locally more abundant than those found at relatively few sites, thus showing a positive abundance-occupancy relationship.

AB The assessment of properties and processes of running waters is a major issue in aquatic environmental management. Because system analysis and prediction with deterministic and stochastic models is often limited by the complexity and dynamic nature of these ecosystems, supplementary or alternative methods have to be developed. We tested the suitability of various types of artificial neural networks for system analysis and impact assessment in different fields: (1) temporal dynamics of water quality based on weather, urban storm-water run-off and waste-water effluents; (2) bioindication of chemical and hydromorphological properties using benthic macroinvertebrates; and (3) long-term population dynamics of aquatic insects. Specific pre-processing methods and neural models were developed to assess relations among complex variables with high levels of significance. For example, the diurnal variation of oxygen concentration (modelled from precipitation and oxygen of the preceding day; R-2 = 0.79), population dynamics of emerging aquatic insects (modelled from discharge, water temperature and abundance of the parental generation; R-2 = 0.93), and water quality and habitat characteristics as indicated by selected sensitive benthic organisms (e.g. R-2 = 0.83 for pH and R-2 = 0.82 for diversity of substrate, using five out of 248 species). Our results demonstrate that neural networks and modelling techniques can conveniently be applied to the above mentioned fields because of their specific features compared with classical methods. Particularly, they can be used to reduce the complexity of data sets by identifying important (functional) inter-relationships and key variables. Thus, complex systems can be reasonably simplified in clear models with low measuring and computing effort. This allows new insights about functional relationships of ecosystems with the potential to improve the assessment of complex impact factors and ecological predictions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Although functional classifications have been successfully used in terrestrial and marine ecosystems to generate ecological hypotheses, compare local and regional environments, and supplement studies of biodiversity, they rarely have been applied to aquatic ecosystems, especially interstitial ones. We present two complementary classifications of interstitial invertebrates, and demonstrate their utility as a supplement for conventional measurements of biodiversity, as "common currency" for regional and global comparisons, as a tool for generating hypotheses, and as indictors of ecological variation in space and time. The first classification uses three species traits: diet, locomotion, and body size. Although mode of reproduction and extent of parental care were originally explored, these traits were less useful for prediction and explanation. The second classification reflects the degree of affinity for different subsurface habitats. Invertebrates can be classified as stygoxenes, stygophiles and stygobites. Changes in conditions in subsurface habitats (e.g. through groundwater extraction, sedimentation) can alter the proportions of these categories, providing a useful biological indicator of subsurface dynamics. Presently, use of these functional classifications is limited by a lack of autecological data for many interstitial species. However, as our knowledge increases and these data are obtained, there is great potential for large-scale ecological hypothesis-testing, prediction of the effects of human and natural disturbances, and global comparisons of interstitial assemblages and biodiversity.

AB 1. Traditionally the assessment of river water quality has been based solely on the measurement of physical, chemical and some biological characteristics. While these measurements may be efficient for regulating effluent discharges and protecting humans, they are not very useful for large-scale management of catchments or for assessing whether river ecosystems are being protected.
   2. Measurements of aquatic biota, to identify structural or functional integrity of ecosystems, have recently gained acceptance for river assessment. Empirical evidence from studies of river ecosystems under stress suggests that a small group of biological ecosystem-level indicators can assess river condition. However, physical and chemical features of the environment affect these indicators, the structure and function of which may be changed by human activities.
   3. The term 'river health', applied to the assessment of river condition, is often seen as being analogous with human health, giving many a sense of understanding. Unfortunately, the meaning of 'river health' remains obscure. It is not clear what aspects of river health sets of ecosystem-level indicators actually identify, nor how physical, chemical and biological characteristics may be integrated into measures rather than just observations of cause and effect.
   4. Increased examination of relationships between environmental variables that affect aquatic biota, such as habitat structure, flow regime, energy sources, water quality and biotic interactions and biological condition, are required in the study of river health.

AB Following metamorphosis, juveniles of marine benthic invertebrates continue to develop traits that allow them to function and survive in their (new) non-pelagic environment. The sensitivity of juvenile development to environmental conditions or larval quality, such as nutritional condition, are not well understood. This study presents descriptions of trait development that allow species identification of newly metamorphosed juvenile sea urchins Strongylocentrotus franciscanus and S. purpuratus. Following metamorphosis, these two species were distinguishable for at least 3 weeks by different patterns of coronal and aboral pedicellariae. Temperature studies, conducted at three environmentally relevant levels (8, 11, and 14 degrees C) show that developmental rates varied, but the order in which structures formed and became functional in the first 2 weeks after metamorphosis were not affected by temperature. Juvenile feeding begins 9 days after metamorphosis at 14 degrees C and after other traits have developed. Based on suites of traits, we identified juvenile stages and quantified effects of temperature on rate of development (stage day(-1)) with nonparametric regression and with a temperature coefficient, Q(10). Additional laboratory studies on S. purpuratus show that larval food ration strongly affects the rate of juvenile trait development prior to and after the onset of feeding by juveniles. Comparisons of size of juvenile rudiments and size at metamorphosis between larvae reared in the laboratory at two food levels and wild-caught larvae and juveniles from coastal Oregon (USA) indicate those from the held were well fed and developed at rapid rates. The above information was used to develop a procedure for aging field caught juveniles ( less than or equal to 2 weeks after metamorphosis), provided their thermal history is known. This procedure can be adapted for other invertebrates that acquire traits in an orderly fashion and can be used, in-addition to sampling-intensive surveys, to investigate recruitment dynamics in benthic populations.

AB In our continued investigation of the adaptive interplay between feeding ecology and digestive physiology, we measured postfeeding responses of juvenile Chelydra serpentina, adult Sternotherus odoratus, and subadult Trachemys scripta, three aquatic turtle species that feed at frequent intervals and consume a catholic diet of plants and animals. In this study, we measured O-2 consumption rates from fasting and digesting individuals and compared intestinal nutrient uptake rates and organ masses of turtles fasted for one month with turtles sacrificed one day after the ingestion of a meal equivalent to 5-11% of body mass. O-2 consumption during digestion peaked at rates 3.4, 2.1, and 2.7 times fasting values, respectively, for C.serpentina, S. odoratus, and T. scripta-factors much smaller than those documented previously for reptile species that normally consume large meals at long intervals. None of the turtle species experienced significant postfeeding changes in intestinal uptake of amino acids or D-glucose. Ratios of amino acid uptake rates to D-glucose uptake rates were much greater than 1.0 for each species, either fasted or fed, a finding characteristic of other carnivores as well. Total intestinal capacity to transport the amino acids L-leucine and L-proline and the sugar D-glucose did not change with feeding for any of the turtle species. None of the species experienced significant differences in intestinal mass or enterocyte morphology between fasted and fed individuals. Chelydra serpentina and T. scripta experienced no significant postfeeding changes in organ masses, and the only changes for S. odoratus were 59% and 42% increases in stomach wet and dry masses, respectively, upon feeding. Thus,juvenile C. serpentina, adult S. odoratus, and subadult T. scripta maintain the functional and morphological integrity of their guts during fasting and exhibit only modest metabolic responses to feeding. We hypothesize that these are adaptive traits characteristic of species that frequently consume and digest small meals.

AB This study used germination methods to examine the density, species composition and functional composition of propagule banks in a series of riverine wetland aquatic habitats subject to varying degrees of hydrological and management-related disturbance. Under permanent inundation (the conditions prevailing at most sites during the growing season) propagule germination and species richness was low, with floodplain perennials and helophytes particularly affected. Densities of floodplain annuals were largely maintained through continued germination of a few flooding tolerant species. On damp mud (conditions associated with hydrological instability) total seedling number and species richness increased significantly, but species richness of germinating hydrophytes declined. Mean seedling density at 0-0.1m depth was 15450 +/- 4400 m(-2), reaching a maximum(162 050 m(-2)) in temporary backwaters. Annual (e.g., Lindernia dubia, Cyperus fuscus) and facultative ruderal species (e.g., Lythrum salicaria and Alisma plantago-aquatica) predominated. Vertical zonation of the propagule bank was weakly developed. The numbers of individuals and species germinating varied significantly between sites. The seasonal, most intensely. disturbed sites (temporary backwaters) supported a numerically large, species rich propagule bank based on floodplain annuals, while the permanent, less disturbed sites (ditches and an oxbow pond) had a small, species-poor propagule bank composed of hydrophytes and helophytes supplemented by allochthonous seed inputs. Sites intermediate on the gradient had a propagule bank dominated by facultative amphibious, ruderal hydrophytes. The composition of the seed bank and the established vegetation was most similar at the heavily disturbed sites where the seed bank was maintained by vigorously fruiting annuals and supplemented by inputs from temporary habitats upstream. At permanent sites much of the propagule bank composition could be accounted for by inputs of floodborne seed from the immediately adjacent floodplain. The established vegetation at such sites appeared to be maintained mainly by vegetative propagation with recruitment from the propagule bank likely only after severe disturbance. The potential contribution of functionally diverse propagule banks to sucessional processes within fluvially dynamic floodplain aquatic habitats is emphasised.

AB Saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis) reportedly has altered ecosystem function in many riparian areas of the American Southwest. I investigated the functional role of this exotic species relative to native Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) along the free-flowing middle San Pedro River in southern Arizona. Floodplains in this dyer reach are co-dominated by young stands of saltcedar (<44 yrs old) and Fremont cotton wood (<67 yrs old), Mean values for 22 of 30 soil, geomorphology, and vegetation structure traits did not differ significantly between saltcedar and Fremont cottonwood stands. Twenty-six of the 30 traits had similar patterns for change over time (inferred from a succession gradient). Saltcedar was functionally equivalent to Fremont cottonwood for about half of the traits construed as indicators of riparian ecosystem function. Several functions or traits that are theoretically or observably influenced by saltcedar on other rivers (e.g., sedimentation rates, electrical conductivity of soils) did not differ between the two species along the San Pedro. This suggests that the functional role of saltcedar is context-specific and variable among rivers. Also in contrast to the working paradigm, saltcedar appeared to enhance the maintenance of floristic biodiversity. Understory herbaceous cover and species richness were significantly greater than in cottonwood stands, perhaps due to soil differences that developed between the two stand types (e.g., higher clay content in saltcedar soils). Stem densities of velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina) and other woody successional species did not differ between saltcedar and cottonwood stands. However, stem densities for this group increased with stand age only for cottonwood, raising the possibility that saltcedar may disrupt successional pathways. Other notable differences included greater basal area and canopy height in cottonwood stands, and accumulation of more phosphorus in cottonwood soils than in saltcedar soils.

AB Although benthic stream macroinvertebrates have been widely used in biomonitoring, further developments towards more general biomonitoring tools are timely. Therefore, we compared traditional ways of biomonitoring such as diversity, biotic indices and community structure with a new approach using biological traits such as reproduction, life duration, and feeding habits. These approaches were applied to a typical biomonitoring scenario, i.e. for two sites being upstream and downstream of the effluent from a waste water treatment plant. Physico-chemical variables did not discriminate between upstream and downstream site. Among eight tested biological indices, only Margalef's and Shannon's index and the French Biotic Index "indice biologique global normalise" (IBGN) significantly separated the upstream from the downstream site. However, biomonitoring through these three indices depended significantly on the sampling effort, which was not the case for the community structure or biological traits. Community structure in terms of taxa abundances separated the upstream from the downstream site (17.9% of discrimination). Biological traits weighted by taxa abundances better separated the upstream from the downstream site (23.1% of discrimination). The biological traits showed that the functional structure at the upstream site was characteristic for organisms using the strategy of resilience in more variable but less adverse environments. In contrast, the functional structure observed at the downstream site was characteristic for organisms using the strategy of resistance in less variable but more adverse environments. Thus, the functional approach to indicate pollution effects in streams through biological traits may provide a tool for future stream management which is robust, general and based on current concepts of ecological theory.

AB Benthic macroinvertebrates are of common use in bioindication. But global indices are not able to diagnose actual causes of damaging. The aim of this study is to integrate recent developments linking biological strategies of animals (reproduction, life duration, feeding habits, respiration) with environmental disturbance.
   This methodology has been applied to the Chalaronne river, a water body receiving effluents from a waste water treatment plant. Biocenotic analysis, based on abundances of taxa, allows discrimination of upstream from downstream stations since 17.9 % of the variability is dedicated to it. Functional analysis, based on biological traits, gives a better discrimination of stations, since the value is equal to 23.1 %.
   This study shows that functional structure observed upstream is characteristic of resilience. On the contrary, functional structure observed downstream is characteristic of resistance.
   A functional approach is interesting for two reasons : first as a mean to discriminate stations efficiently, and secondly it is promising in study of biological functionalities of ecosystems.

AB The naturally occurring genetic heterogeneity of autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing populations belonging to the beta subclass of the Proteobacteria was studied by using a newly developed PCR-based assay targeting a partial stretch of the gene which encodes the active-site polypeptide of ammonia monooxygenase (amoA). The PCR yielded a specific 491-bp fragment with all of the nitrifiers tested, but not with the homologous stretch of the particulate methane monooxygenase, a key enzyme of the methane oxidizing bacteria. The assay also specifically detected amoA in DNA extracted from various aquatic and terrestrial environments. The resulting PCR products retrieved from rice roots, activated sludge, a freshwater sample, and an enrichment culture were used for the generation of amoA gene libraries. No false positives were detected in a set of 47 randomly selected clone sequences that were analyzed further. The majority of the environmental sequences retrieved from rice roots and activated sludge grouped within the phylogenetic radiation defined by cultured strains of the genera Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira. The comparative analysis identified members of both of these genera in activated sludge; however, only Nitrosospira-like sequences with very similar amino acid patterns were found on rice roots. Further differentiation of these molecular isolates was clearly possible on the nucleic acid level due to the accumulation of synonymous mutations, suggesting that several closely related but distinct Nitrosospira-like populations are the main colonizers of the rhizosphere of rice. Each of the amoA gene libraries obtained from the freshwater sample and the enrichment culture was dominated by a novel lineage that shared a branch with the Nitrosospira cluster but could not be assigned to any of the known pure cultures. Our data suggest that amoA represents a very powerful molecular tool for analyzing indigenous ammonia-oxidizing communities due to (i) its specificity, (ii) its fine-scale resolution of closely related populations, and (iii) the fact that a functional trait rather than a phylogenetic trait is detected.

AB Fluctuating asymmetry of morphological traits is thought to reflect the capacity of a genotype to produce an integrated, functional phenotype. I tested three predictions. (1) In a polygynous breeding system, under intense sexual selection on males, breeding males should show greater symmetry in bilaterally symmetrical traits than non-breeding males or females. (2) If these traits are under stabilizing selection, highly symmetrical individuals also should be modal phenotypes, thus near the mean value for that trait, whereas individuals with increased asymmetry should represent marginal phenotypes, near the extremes of the distribution for that trait. (3) Differences in the intensity of sexual selection should be reflected in differences in the degree of fluctuating asymmetry between sexes among populations. I examined the relationship between male breeding status and the degree of fluctuating asymmetry of four bilaterally symmetrical traits, preorbital and preopercular pores and pectoral and pelvic fin rays, in two populations of Pecos pupfish which differed in the intensity of sexual selection. These traits do not function in male-male competition or female choice, thus are not directly affected by sexual selection. In Mirror Lake breeding males, as a group, were most symmetrical for all four traits, while non-breeding males and females showed higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry. Similarly, symmetrical individuals also represented modal phenotypes for four traits (breeding males), and for three traits (non-breeding males and females). These patterns were not seen in the Lake Francis population, where breeding males were as asymmetrical as non-breeding males and females, and the degree of fluctuating symmetry did not differ between modal and marginal phenotypes for any of the four traits. When ecological conditions favour intense sexual selection, either through female choice, male-male competition, or both, breeding males represent the most fit phenotypes. Thus sexual selection reinforces the effects of stabilizing selection on characters that do not function as secondary sexual trails. However, when sexual selection is relaxed, differences between sexes disappear. (C) 1997 The Linnean Society of London.

AB This investigation examines the role of trait-mediated indirect interactions in a simple aquatic food web. We conducted the experiments in cattle watering tanks in order to establish whether competitive and predator-prey interactions between two species are affected by other species in the system; i.e., are pairwise interaction strengths affected by the background species assemblage? We examined the survival and growth response of small bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and small green frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles in the presence and absence of a competitor (large bullfrogs), the lethal presence of the larval odonate predator Tramea lacerata, and the nonlethal (caged) presence of the larval odonate predators Anax junius and Anax longipes. We demonstrate that large bullfrog competitors and caged Anax affect traits (foraging activity level) of small bullfrog and small green frog tadpoles and that these changes in traits, in turn, affect interactions of the small tadpole species with each other and with the other species. In particular, the following four trait-mediated indirect interactions were evident: (1) Presence of large bullfrog competitors increased the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs and small bullfrogs. (2) Presence of nonlethal Anax reduced the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs. (3) Presence of nonlethal Anax increased the competitive advantage of bullfrogs over green frogs. (4) Presence of nonlethal Anax facilitated midge invasion of the experimental units. The proposed mechanisms (changes in small tadpole activity) involved in these trait-mediated indirect interactions were supported by observational data on tadpole activity and resource levels in the experimental units, and in laboratory experiments examining tadpole activity responses to predators. The occurrence of strong trait-mediated indirect interactions in this simple food web underscores the potential importance of such interactions in animal communities.

AB A heuristic framework for understanding and predicting the distribution and categorical abundance of species in stream communities is presented. The framework requires that species be described in terms of their functional relationships to habitat selective forces or their surrogates, which constitute ''filters'' occurring at hierarchical landscape scales (ranging from microhabitats to watersheds or basins). Large-scale filters are viewed as causative or mechanistic agents that constrain expression of local selective forces or biotic potential at lower scales. To join a local community, species in a regional pool must possess appropriate functional attributes (species traits) to ''pass'' through the nested filters. Biotic interactions are also a potential filter on local community composition, and they are invoked at the lower hierarchical levels, after species have passed through the physicochemical habitat filters. Potential landscape filters and their associated selective properties are identified, as are prospective species traits (for invertebrates and fish) that correspond with filters. A categorical niche model is used to illustrate how relative abundances of species in local communities might be predicted from habitat data collected at different scales.
   The framework emphasizes a biologically based approach to understanding and predicting species distribution and abundance and local community composition by explicitly considering environmental constraints imposed at different scales. As such, it can complement non-mechanistic, correlative approaches to community prediction that often lack generality. Operationalizing the framework will require additional research to specify more clearly 1) the degree to which habitat features at different scales are linked functionally or statistically, 2) what species traits ate possessed by strongly interactive species (e.g., keystones) and which habitat filters most strongly constrain the distribution of these species, and 3) the functional significance of a range of species traits and the extent to which these traits are correlated and hence respond in concert to the presence or modification, of a particular filter. Multi-scale, mechanistic understanding of species-environment relations will likely contribute to better predictions about large scale problems, such as the establishment and spread of exotic species or alterations in community composition with changing land use or climate.

AB Observations are presented on mouthpart functional morphology, and on feeding, grooming and defaecatory behaviour of eight species of corophioid Amphipoda, viz. Corophium bonnellii, Lembos websteri, Aora gracilis, A. spinicornis, Gammaropsis nitida, Ericthonius punctatus, Jassa falcata and J. marmorata. These data are considered in relation to tube structure and amphipod posture in relation to the tube. All these species occupy double-ended cylindrical tubes made from 'amphipod silk' secreted by the third and fourth peraeopods, incorporating sediment and other debris to varying degrees. Uniquely among this set of species, however, E. punctatus has a tube that is architecturally distinct. It tapers along its length and has a distinctive oblique main entrance at its widest end. This end is used preferentially. The other species studied use either opening with equal facility. Such a feature is adaptive in facilitating deployment of the antennae and shielding the head of E. punctatus.
   Two groupings of species are proposed: group A which feed inside their tube using pleopod-induced through-tube currents, and group B which feed outside or at the entrance to their tube using external water currents. Group A includes C. bonnellii, L. websteri and the Aora spp. Group B includes E. punctatus and the Jassa spp. Gammaropsis nitida exhibits traits from both groups, adding weight to its perceived status as a genus representative of the stem corophioid. The ischyrocerid habit of externalizing food-gathering may be regarded as the first step along an evolutionary line leading to the rod-building podocerid types and ultimately towards the caprellids. All species examined show a degree of flexibility in their feeding habits which helps to explain the success of this taxon, which has radiated into a great diversify of aquatic biotopes.

AB The functional deficiencies observed in several populations of the sea urchin Sphaerechinus granularis from the Bay of Brest confirm the sensitivity of this species to environmental conditions. These abnormalities, though suspected for over a decade, are quantified for the first time in the present study, carried out in 1993 and 1994. It was based on the comparison of physiological (gonadal and gut indices) and demographic (recruitment, growth rate, maximal size and longevity) indices. The results obtained reveal that there are significant differences between the reference population (Goulet de Brest and Glenan Archipelago in southern Brittany) and the populations located in the centre and northern areas of the Bay. The sea urchins living in the vicinity of Armorique Point, at the mouth of the river Aulne, appear to be particularly affected, showing abnormally low levels of ingestion and gonad development, the absence of a distinct spawning and the lowest growth rate in the Bay. The results of this demographic study confirm the results of ecotoxicological tests simultaneously carried out (analysis of fertility, embryonic blocking failure and larval abnormalities in the different populations). Analysis of heavy metals present within the sea urchin gonads revealed concentrations of lead, copper, iron and zinc that are 2 to 5 times those observed for the other populations. At Armorique Point, the functional deficiencies observed are discussed in relation to metal accumulation, and notably local iron contamination.

AB The classical approach for investigating latitudinal variations in Life history tactics of ectotherms is to determine if there are significant correlations between the traits of a given species and latitude. However, as temperature does not vary linearly with latitude, the latter parameter may only be a gross index of local climatic conditions. The objective of this paper is to present how we used Litynski's (1984) climate classification to investigate latitudinal variations in life history traits of the white sucker (Catostomus commersoni). Data from the literature (44 lakes) and from sampling done on 18 lakes of the Laurentian Shield (Quebec, Canada) were used to compare different approaches to predict geographical variations in life history traits. The results showed that variation in life history traits of the white sucker documented over the geographical extent of the study area was better explained by considering the numerical classification of climates, based on mean annual temperature, annual precipitation and an index of continentality, rather than by simple linear regression with latitude or mean annual temperature; longevity and age at maturity of males and females were significantly higher in northern populations while maximum length, length at maturity of males and females, and growth were significantly higher in southern populations. Our results suggest that it may be better to use functional climatic variables, instead of the more usual ones, such as latitude and mean annual air temperature, to study geographical variations in the life history of ectotherms.

AB Fast-start escape performances for two species of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus spp., were investigated using high-speed cinematography (400 Hz). The two fishes (not yet formally described, referred to here as benthic and limnetic) inhabit different niches within Paxton Lake, British Columbia, Canada, and are recent, morphologically distinct species. All escape responses observed for both species were double-bend C-type fast-starts. There were no significant differences between the species for any linear or angular parameter (pooled averages, both species: duration 0.048s, distance 0.033m, maximum velocity 1.10 m s(-1), maximum acceleration 137 m s(-2), maximum horizontal angular velocity 473.6 rad s(-1) and maximum overall angular velocity 511.1 rad s(-1)). Benthics and limnetics have the greatest added mass (M(a)) at 0.3 and 0.6 body lengths, respectively. The maximum M(a) does not include the fins for benthics. but for limnetics the dorsal and anal fins contribute greatly to the maximum M(a). The deep, posteriorly placed fins of limnetics enable them to have a fast-start performance equivalent to that of the deeper-bodied benthics.
   Both the limnetic and benthic fishes have significantly higher escape fast-start velocities than their ancestral form, the anadromous threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, suggesting that the high performance of the Paxton Lake sticklebacks is an evolutionarily derived trait. In this biomechanical study of functional morphology, we demonstrate that similar high fast-start performance can be achieved by different suites of morphological characteristics and suggest that predation might be the selective force for the high escape performance in these two fishes.

AB Organisms that live in highly variable environments, such as rivers, rely on adaptations to withstand and recover from disturbance. These adaptations include behavioral traits, such as habitat preference and plasticity of reproductive timing, that minimize the effects of discharge fluctuation. Studies linking hydrologic regime, habitat preference, and population processes, however, are predominantly limited to fish. Information on other sensitive taxa is necessary to facilitate conservation of multispecies assemblages and restoration of biodiversity in degraded river channels.
   I studied the functional relationship between physical habitat and reproduction of the foothills yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii), a California State Species of Special Concern. From 1992 to 1994, I mapped breeding sites along 5.3 km of the South Fork Eel River in northern California and monitored egg survival to hatching. Frogs selected sites over a range of spatial scales and timed their egg-laying to avoid fluctuations in river stage and current velocity associated with changes in discharge. The main sources of mortality were desiccation and subsequent predation of eggs in a dry year and scour from substrate in wet years, both caused by changes in stage and velocity. At the finest spatial scale, frogs attached eggs to cobbles and boulders at lower than ambient flow velocities. At larger scales, breeding sites were near confluences of tributary drainages and were located in wide, shallow reaches. Clutches laid in relatively narrower and deeper channels had poor survival in rainy as well as dry springs. Most breeding sites were used repeatedly, despite between- and within-year variation in spring stage of the river. This pattern of site selection suggests that conservation of Rana boylii may be enhanced by maintaining or restoring channels with shapes that provide stable habitat over a range of river stages.

ID FRESH-WATER GOBY; GOBIIDAE; TELEOSTEI; TRAITS
AB The male Arno goby Padogobius nigricans courts ripe females by emitting sounds at a high rate, mainly from the nest hollow. Laboratory observations revealed that each sound is an almost pure tone wave showing marked amplitude modulation and decrease of frequency throughout its length. The mean tone frequency averaged 79.4 Hz and the sound duration averaged 327 ms. Both these sound parameters were significantly affected by the temperature of the water. Acoustic behaviour during sexual interactions was compared for tank-confined males and mates from a community group. The fact that acoustic activity of the male peaked when the female stayed motionless at the nest entrance suggested that the sound emitted by the male P. nigricans has a role as an advertising signal. Observation of spawning behaviour showed the emission of sounds by the male rapidly diminished and eventually ceased shortly after the beginning of oviposition. Thus, the male sound seems not to be a functional component of the spawning behaviour. Finally, data on vocal behaviour of this species were examined within a comparative framework, also taking into consideration phylogenetic relationships between Italian freshwater gobies.

AB Somatic embryogenesis is a phylogenetically ancient trait that allows sessile plants to grow in a modular fashion and to respond plastically to different environmental cues. It facilitates damage repair and permits clonal growth, the capacity to produce potentially independent but genetically identical offspring. Clonal growth is observed to originate from both the shoot or the root part of the plant body and it has been assigned various ecological functions such as reproduction, exploitation and persistence. These functions are rooted in two basic morphological characteristics of clonal growth: the longevity and the length of the connection between clonal parts. Clonality, although an ancient trait, shows a polyphyletic distribution among plant taxa with a strong representation especially among monocots. Phylogenetically controlled comparisons show that clonality is more common among species that occur in cold or nutrient-poor habitats and under poor light conditions. The frequent occurrence of clonals among aquatic species is confounded by the fact that many aquatics are monocots. This however does not necessarily preclude a functional ecological explanation. It is further shown that longevity and length of connection covary negatively, yielding two distinct clonal growth strategies (fragmenting versus compact, persistent clones) with a preference for the more common habitat trait combinations: nutrient-rich, shaded and/or wet versus nutrient-poor, open and/or dry, respectively.

AB The functional significance of herbivore-induced plant traits known to directly or indirectly influence herbivore performance remains largely untested under field conditions due to the difficulty of uncoupling the response to herbivory from the act of herbivory. The signals that activate many of the induced responses in plants are endogenously produced in response to wounding, unlike many of the predator-induced responses found in aquatic invertebrates (which are activated by exogenous cues derived from predators). Jasmonates, endogenously-produced damage signals, activate diverse wound-induced responses in plants including induced nicotine production in Nicotiana sylvestris. The results presented here are from two experiments which illustrate the use of jasmonates to uncouple induced nicotine production in Nicotiana attenuata (Torrey ex. Watson) from wounding. The exogenous addition of methyl jasmonate (MJ) in small quantities (11 mu g for a 1.4 g dry mass plant) to roots of hydroponically-grown plants induces de novo nicotine synthesis and increases whole-plant nicotine concentrations just as wounding does. The MJ-induced changes were proportional to the quantity of MJ given. Moreover, the effects of MJ were additive to the effects of damage. Applications of MJ to shoots were less effective. Root treatments also worked with plants growing in a field plot. The application of MJ represents a promising tool for examining the functional significance of induced nicotine responses in plants growing in their native environments.

AB The effects oi nonselective predation on the optimal age and size of maturity of their prey tire investigated using mathematical models of a simple life history with juvenile and adult stages. Fitness is measured by the product of survival ro the adult stage and expected adult reproduction, which is usually an increasing function of size at maturity. Size is determined by both age at maturity and the value of costly traits that increase mean growth rate (growth effort), The analysis includes cases with fixed size but flexible time to maturity, fixed time but flexible size, and adaptively flexible values of both variables. In these analyses, growth effort is flexible. For comparison with previous theory, models with a fixed growth effort are analyzed, In each case, there may he indirect effects of predation on the prey's food supply. The effect of increased predation depends on (I) which variables are flexible; (2) whether increased growth effort requires increased exposure to predators; and (3) how increased predator density affects the abundance of Pc,od for juvenile prey; Ii there is no indirect effect of predators on prey food supply, size at maturity will generally decrease in response to increased predation. However, the indirect effect from increased food has the opposite effect, and the net result of predation is often increased size. Age at maturity may either increase or decrease, depending on functional forms and parameter values; this is true regardless of the presence of indirect effects. The results are compared with those of previous theoretical analyses. Observed shifts in life history in response to predation am reviewed, and the role of lie-selective predation is reassessed.

AB Nearly all aspects of the life histories of individual marine-invertebrate species are characterized by ranges of;sizes, seasonal variation, and functional flexibility and phenotypic plasticity in response to varying environmental conditions; that is, they are highly polytypic. Four major areas of polytypy are considered: (1) breeding seasons and cycles vary greatly in time and duration with latitude and from year to year; (2) egg and larval sizes, while showing both genetic and stochastic variability in all species, are often also flexible responses to adult and larval nutrition; (3) modes of development are variable within a number of single species, often reflecting egg-size differences between populations, or even as a result of hatching age of siblings from a single egg mass; and (4) duration of the pelagic larval phase, both before and after the onset of metamorphic competence. Planktotrophic larvae show plastic responses to phytoplankton abundance in their morphologies, and most larvae are flexible in their age at metamorphosis because this complex process requires a more-or-less specialized substratum to induce it for most invertebrate species. New data are presented that provide additional examples of broad flexibility of sibling lecithotrophic larvae to hatch and settle at greatly differing ages. Larvae of the patelloidean gastropod Lottia pelta settled from 8 to 28 days after fertilization, and those of the fissurelloidean Diodora aspera hatched over a three week period from 7 to 30 days post-fertilization; larval settlement had a similarly broad range. Even the planktotrophic-lecithotrophic dichotomy breaks down as increasing numbers of species are found to produce larvae that can metamorphose without feeding (i.e. lecithotrophy), or feed and greatly extend their larval durations (planktotrophy) in the absence of suitable settlement substrata. Invertebrate groups with rigidly canalized life histories are noted to be components of the fouling community, and it is conjectured that an evolutionary history on floating substrata canalized their life histories toward high inbreeding tolerance, often selfing, and brief pelagic larval durations. We note that most life-history theory has considered extremes and major modes in invertebrate development, and suffers from lack of-attention to the abundance of polytypic life-history traits as evolutionary survival mechanisms at the species level. We conclude that response flexibility and plasticity increase both survivorship and fecundity of individuals, while life-history variability increases the likelihood of recruitment across populations and persistence over geological time. More data are needed on the ranges of scalar characters and flexible responses in marine-invertebrate life histories to rigorously evaluate their contributions to evolutionary success.

AB Phenotypic, genetic, and environmental variances and covariances for 33 morphometric traits were estimated for a population of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, from the Brush Creek drainage, California, by sib analysis of laboratory-bred families. Heritabilities of the morphometric traits ranged from -0.28 to 0.78, and were moderately low (mean h(2) = 0.26); the mean and range of heritabilities for five phenotypic eigenvectors were similar. The average coefficient of genetic determination of the traits and eigenvectors was high (0.57 and 0.63, respectively), indicating a substantial genotypic contribution to variation in body morphology. The defensive complex, a functional set of bony armor structures, was genetically and environmentally integrated: genetic factors (e.g., pleiotropy) are reinforced by environmental factors to produce a functional phenotype. Other components of morphology, including body form, were environmentally, but not genetically, integrated. Given the importance of genetic factors to evolutionary change under natural selection, these results implicate natural selection in the evolution of the defensive complex; the role of natural selection in the evolution of other components of morphology is equivocal. Genetic integration of functionally (phenotypically) independent traits suggests that stochastic processes or pleiotropic mutation also have played a role in the evolution of morphology in this population of sticklebacks.

AB Modem immunology can now trace its molecules, cells, organs and functions that fight infectious diseases to prototypic ancestors in both the aquatic and terrestrial environments. It is not clear which environment exerted the greatest evolutionary pressure during the development of immunologic characteristics. Clearly immune responsiveness began as recognition even at the unicellular level when eukaryotes appeared. Multicellularity brought with it the simultaneous differentiation and specialization of multiple functions including immune competence. For comparative immunologists to adhere to the dogmatic deuterostome/protostome classification of complex metazoans may prove to be inadequate since this taxonomic scheme concerns embryologic origins of the mouth and anus, Other theories that relate to homology/analogy, convergence/divergence may help us to explain what are (for now) common, functional immune traits among both animal groups. Origins deciphered by amino acid and nucleotide sequences will resolve the dilemma of immunologic characteristics common to deuterostomes and protostomes. Precise characterizations and analyses of the resulting homologies and comparisons will yield fruitful information. First, we may then deduce common origins as has been revealed, for example, in functional molecules and cells such as actin/myosin that govern motility. Second, in contrast, we may arrive at what are clear analogies. With respect to origins of immunity there seems to be a preponderance of characteristics associated with tunicates [those of lymphocyte-like cells; IL-1; (IL-2 like) molecules, putative members of the Ig superfamily (Thy-1; Lyt); lectins] that may prove to be homologous once stringent requirements of sequence analyses are fully described. The self/non-self view should be rescued from ad nauseam preoccupation with examining yet more species with respect to (for example) phagocytosis, graft rejection or agglutinin synthesis. Instead, we should direct our research at the membrane level of hemocytes.

AB Limited research has been conducted on characterizing the genetic variability of important agronomic traits of forage grasses grown in seeded swards. This study was conducted to estimate the degree of genetic control, i.e., the heritability (h(2)), of several agronomic, morphological and physiological traits of crested wheatgrass [Agropyron desertorum (Fischer ex Link) Schultes] under sward conditions. Thirty randomly selected half-sib families from a genetically broad-based crested wheatgrass population were evaluated at one location for 2 yr in single-row plots that were spaced 38 cm apart and seeded at a rate of 90 seed m(-1). Heritabilities were determined for the following traits based on the progeny means of the 30 families: fresh forage yield, dry matter yield, tiller height, tiller number, Bag leaf width, spikelets per spike, proline content, first-cut vigor, regrowth vigor, and Bag leaf pubescence. Heritability estimates of fresh forage yield were similar, i.e, 80 and 82%, when based on 30 and 300 half-sib families, respectively, indicating that a sample size of 30 families provided a reliable estimate of genetic variance in this crested wheatgrass population. With the exceptions of tiller number and proline content (h(2) = 0%), all traits demonstrated moderate to high heritabilities, ranging from 53 to 86%. Confidence interval widths ranged from 14 to 116% as large as the heritability point estimate. Significant family x year interactions were detected for some traits that possessed moderate to high heritabilities. The interaction variance components, however, were significantly less than their corresponding genetic variance for all traits except first-cut vigor. The results indicate that for most traits, evaluation for multiple years would not be needed.

AB Phally, a genital polymorphism found in some species of self-compatible simultaneous hermaphrodites, presents an opportunity to examine environmental and genetic influences on mating system traits. Both aphallics and euphallics can self-fertilize, but aphallics cannot donate sperm because they do not develop a functional penis and prostate. Previous studies of the freshwater gastropod Bulinus truncatus (Mollusca: Pulmonata) suggest that in at least some laboratory populations, phally is determined by temperature during egg and hatchling stages, with colder temperatures favoring the development of euphally. Here we provide evidence for temperature-influenced phally determination in natural populations of B. truncatus in northern Nigeria. The prevalence of euphally across 49 populations ranged from 0 to 81%. Levels of euphally increased significantly both within and across sites as temperatures decreased during the dry-cool season. Across sites, time of year (date) was the strongest single predictor of proportion of euphallics. When the effects of time of year were controlled for, there was a significant negative correlation between temperature during phally development and proportion of euphallics. In addition, maximum water temperature during the Ist wk of the study predicted proportions of euphallics in the next snail generation. A laboratory study of snails from three of these populations demonstrated that temperature sensitivities differed between populations: one population that remained 100% aphallic over the course of held observations showed only low levels of temperature sensitivity in the laboratory, while a population that tripled in proportion of euphallics in the field showed strong levels of temperature sensitivity. Furthermore, individuals within populations varied in their temperature sensitivities. These results are discussed in light of the adaptive significance of labile phally determination.

AB 1. To test predictions of the river habitat templet and the patch dynamics concept, trends in species traits and species richness of aquatic beetles were related to the spatial - temporal variability of eighteen habitat types in the alluvial floodplain of the French Upper Rhone River. One hundred and twenty species of beetles were used in this analysis.
   2. The basic information was obtained either from the literature (for most of the species traits) or from observations made at approximately 500 sampling sites in the Bregnier-Cordon and Jons sections over the past 19 years (for habitat utilization). This information was structured by a fuzzy coding technique and examined by ordination analyses.
   3. Analyses of the relationships among nineteen species traits revealed a clear distinction according to traits such as body form (for adults), functional feeding type and food (adults and larvae), attachment to the substrate and dissemination potential (adults and larvae), and patterns of aquatic and/or terrestrial life of adults and larvae. Species traits such as number of descendants per reproductive cycle, and number of reproductive cycles per year or per individual showed less contrast, because these traits are rather homogeneous in aquatic beetles.
   4. Analyses of the habitat utilization by the aquatic beetles revealed a vertical gradient that separates interstitial from superficial habitats, and a transverse gradient for the superficial habitats, which extends from the main channel towards permanent oxbow lakes and temporary waters.
   5. The significant relationship betweeen species traits and habitat utilization demonstrates that most beetle species use a particular set of habitat types with a particular set of species trait modalities.
   6. Species traits of aquatic beetles are homogeneous but evidently very successful and are adapted to many potential conditions of spatial-temporal variability. Because of this homogeneity, observations on aquatic beetles do not support trends of traits in the framework of spatial-temporal variability predicted from the river habitat templet.
   7. The observed species richness of aquatic beetles is low in habitat types with a low spatial-temporal variability, increases as spatial variability increases, and tends to be highest at intermediate temporal variability. This pattern matches predictions of the patch dynamics concept.

DE COMPETITIVE ABILITY; STRESS TOLERANCE; SURVIVAL STRATEGY; TRAITS
AB 1. The aim of this work is to formulate a methodology for the use of trait analysis to classify European riverine wetlands into functional vegetation types. Plant species and data on biological traits and survival strategy were collected from sites in England (Bradford Mill and Kismeldon, River Torridge), France (R. Allier at Apremont and the R. Loire at Decize) and Ireland (R. Shannon at Clonmacnoise and the Little Brosna near Banagher) during 1991.
   2. Linear and multiple discriminant analyses were used to distinguish objectively between plant populations with a priori-selected strategies. There appeared to be very little variation in disturbance-tolerance (D) between the wetland plant populations studied. Competitive and stress-tolerant plants were found to be significantly different by linear discriminant analysis using 12 descriptive parameters. Multiple discriminant analysis permitted a distinction to be drawn between competitive (C), stress-tolerant (S) and intermediate strategy plants, and retrospectively classified the populations in accordance with the strategies suggested for them by previous work .
   3. Stepwise multiple regression was used to identify the important survival traits for predicting competitive ability and stress tolerance. Significant predictors of the C strategy were the height of the plant and the dry weight of the leaves; and of the S strategy the dry weight of stems and weight per seed. Use of the predictive equations permitted the importance of the C and S strategy elements to be determined for 78 plant populations.
   4. Weighted for plant cover, mean C and S scores of the plant populations present in each sample unit of vegetation were utilized to determine the functional vegetation type (FVT) in terms of competitiveness (CFVT) and stress tolerance (SFVT). Vegetation samples were ordinated using CFVT and SFVT values. CFVT and SFVT values were highly inversely correlated: a trade-off between competitive ability and stress tolerance in wetland plants was apparent.

AB Four definable feeding behaviors used during the metamorphic life history of tiger salamanders are terrestrial prey capture and transport (as adults) and aquatic prey capture and transport (as larvae). Previous studies have focused primarily on the first three of these behaviors and thus aquatic prey transport is poorly understood. These studies have indicated that terrestrial prey capture has unique kinematic and motor patterns, whereas the other behaviors are quite similar to one another. Using high-speed video analysis, the kinematics of aquatic prey transport in larval Ambystoma tigrinum are described using both lateral and ventral views. These kinematic patterns are statistically compared with the kinematic patterns of aquatic prey capture, terrestrial prey capture and terrestrial prey transport. Statistical analyses allow us to assess the similarities and differences among the four behaviors and to determine the effect of the metamorphic environmental transition (water to land) and morphological changes of the feeding mechanism (suction-to lingual-based) on feeding kinematics. Our data do not support the notion that lingual-based terrestrial prey capture uses unique kinematic patterns compared with the other three behaviors, which consist of similar movements. Rather, each of the feeding behaviors has unique kinematic features that distinguish it from the others. In addition, variation in tiger salamander feeding kinematics is more a function of the feeding event (whether it is capture or transport) than of the environment in which the feeding takes place or the morphology of the feeding mechanism. Finally, we encourage the use of parsimony-based methods of phylogenetic analysis to analyze shared traits (such as kinematic and/or electromyographic variables) in comparative studies of behavior within a single species.

AB Limited research has been directed towards characterizing the phenotypic and genotypic variability of different traits in North American plant species. This study was conducted to estimate the degree of genetic control, i.e., the heritability (h2), of several agronomic and morphological traits of ND-WWG931 western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii, (Rydb.) Love] and to provide insight into appropriate sample sizes needed to estimate genetic parameters. Thirty randomly selected half-sib families of ND-WWG931 western wheatgrass were evaluated over 2 years and 2 locations in seeded single-row plots. Heritabilities were determined for the following traits based on the progeny means of the 30 families: dry matter yield, tiller height, spikelets per spike, vigor, spike density, spike pubescence, and spikelet color. Spike density, dry matter yield, and vigor had relatively high heritabilities (h2 = 79, 72, and 67%, respectively) and were estimated with the greatest precision (90% confidence interval width range: 33 to 64% as large as the point estimate). Spike pubescence, spikelets per spike, tiller height, and spikelet color demonstrated moderate to low heritabilities (h2 = 55, 49, 33, and 0% respectively) and were estimated with the least precision as demonstrated by relatively wide confidence limits. The genetic variance components for spike density, forage yield, vigor, and spike pubescence exceeded twice their standard errors indicating that selection for these traits should be effective in ND-WWG931. Heritability estimates of fresh forage yield were essentially the same, i.e., 61.9 and 61.5%, when based on either 30 or 270 half-sib families, respectively, indicating that a sample size of 30 families was adequate to provide reliable estimates of genetic variance in ND-WWG931. These data provide general insight into the population genetics of a North American plant species and demonstrate an approach to determine the genetic variability within plant materials that are being used for rangeland revegetation.

AB The extent to which insect communities are organized is poorly understood because few studies have examined both population-level processes and community-level patterns. Furthermore, our view of phytophagous insect populations is probably biased by the more frequent attention given to economic pests whose dynamics might be expected to be somewhat exceptional. Herein, we report on the population dynamics and community-level features in a diverse, native fauna of phytophagous insects associated with goldenrod (Solidago altissima), a native perennial plant that forms a dominant, long-persisting element in old-field succession. The data consist of censuses taken in six consecutive years at 16 old fields in the Finger Lakes Region of New York; five additional stands were followed for four consecutive years. Our analyses address two questions: (a) to what extent is the functional structure of the community (as reflected in such attributes to the herbivore load, guild spectrum, and dominance hierarchy) maintained by compensatory changes in the densities of the member species and (b) are certain traits associated with a species' tendency to fluctuate in density or to dominate the community?
   In general, populations of goldenrod insects fluctuated less than those of insects reported in the literature. Few were abundant; only 7 of the 138 species in the goldenrod fauna ever reached densities at which their biomass exceeded 0. 1% of the leaf biomass. The functional structure of the community, as reflected in the total herbivore load and the proportions of that load contributed by various guilds, varied widely in space and time. A small subset of the fauna remained dominant throughout the study; these species, whose populations occasionally irrupted, retained their high rank in relative abundance even during those periods when their populations were waning. There was no evidence for compensatory changes in the densities of species within guilds, as would be expected if a relatively distinct set of limiting resources were available to insects with different feeding styles. Species were no more likely to exhibit negative correlations with their guild mates than they were with members of other guilds. There was also little evidence of sporadic or diffuse competition within the fauna as a whole; even during population outbreaks, the dominant species rarely engendered decreases in the biomass or diversity of the remaining species, and increases in the total herbivore load were seldom associated with losses of species from the community. Several species were positively associated with one another on the basis of similar habitat requirements or the use by one species of conditions created by the presence of another. The community was predictable only in the sense that dominant species remained dominant and rare species rare. The abundance and population variability of species were not correlated with such traits as body size, generation time, or host range. Taxon-related trends, on the other hand, stood out; coleopterans tended to be abundant whereas lepidopterans were rare, and hemipterans tended to fluctuate widely whereas dipterans remained relatively constant. Furthermore, species that were clumped in space (onto stems within fields) tended to be abundant and variable. The "boom and bust" dynamics of these aggregating species may be related to the ability of colonies to survive the inroads of generalist predators. The low degree of regional synchrony in the performance of populations at different sites suggests that large-scale, weather-driven fluctuations are uncommon.
   Our analysis of this well-developed, native insect fauna reveals a community that has a somewhat predictable structure that reflects the idiosyncracies of the component species. These species do not fluctuate in an integrated community-structuring manner, but as an outcome of each species performing at its "individualistic' level, the community displays a characteristic dominance hierarchy. The members of this diverse fauna rarely achieve densities at which they compete with one another. Our results are consistent with Hairston, Smith, and Slobodkin's hypothesis (1960) which predicts that terrestrial herbivores rarely deplete plant resources to levels at which there is widespread interspecific competition.

AB The behavioral feeding ecology of Ephemerella needhami McDunnough (Ephemeroptera: Ephemerellidae) larvae was studied using field observations, gut content analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and videomacroscopy. These techniques allowed correlation of behavior, microhabitat, and diet. Field studies showed that the mayfly larvae were intimately associated with the filamentous green alga Cladophora. Development of middle and late instar larvae always coincided with the early season development of Cladophora mats. Behavioral observation and gut analysis indicated that detritus and epiphytic diatoms associated with Cladophora filaments, as well as the filaments themselves, constituted the primary diet of E. needhami. The mayfly is primarily a collector-gatherer detritivore but also qualifies as a herbivore and a carnivore. The larvae possess several morphological and behavioral traits that are apparent adaptations for living with Cladophora. Life cycle synchronization, spination, coloration, and feeding behavior allow E. needhami to use Cladophora as a substrate, refuge, food, and food-gathering device.
