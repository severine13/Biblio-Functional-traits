AB Trait-based approaches to community structure are increasingly used in terrestrial ecology. We show that such an approach, augmented by a mechanistic analysis of trade-offs among functional traits, can be successfully used to explain community composition of marine phytoplankton along environmental gradients. Our analysis of literature on major functional traits in phytoplankton, such as parameters of nutrient-dependent growth and uptake, reveals physiological trade-offs in species abilities to acquire and utilize resources. These trade-offs, arising from fundamental relations such as cellular scaling laws and enzyme kinetics, define contrasting ecological strategies of nutrient acquisition. Major groups of marine eukaryotic phytoplankton have adopted distinct strategies with associated traits. These diverse strategies of nutrient utilization can explain the distribution patterns of major functional groups and size classes along nutrient availability gradients.

AB Large river floodplains potentially include the full range of freshwater ecosystems from permanently flowing channels to temporary pools and springs. Attempts to restore such complex systems require tools adapted to assess restoration success. In an analysis of invertebrate assemblages in the Rhone River floodplain (France), taxonomic-based indices (rarefied richness and assemblage composition) were compared with functional metrics using trait-based ratios as surrogates of ecosystem processes. Their ability to respond to a gradient of hydrological connectivity was assessed in 7 cut-off channels. The sampling design included 2 sites/channel (upstream and downstream), 4 randomly chosen sampling points (0.5 x 0.5-m quadrats)/site, and 2 sampling seasons (spring and summer). Water physicochemical and habitat variables were recorded when invertebrates were sampled. Environmental variables, including water conductance, [NH3-N], submerged vegetation cover, diversity of sediment grain size, and organic matter content of the sediment, were used to construct a synthetic variable describing the hydrological connectivity of each site with the main river channel. A quadratic regression of rarefied taxonomic richness and the connectivity gradient was not quite significant, but assemblage composition was strongly related to the gradient. Four of 8 trait-based metrics; were correlated with the connectivity gradient. Values of metrics that are surrogates for top-down control of assemblage structure and habitat stability (based on functional feeding groups) declined along the gradient from disconnected sites to more connected sites. Values of metrics that are surrogates for voltinism and food supply for water-column-feeding fish increased with connectivity. Top-down control and voltinism surrogates suggested a decline in predator-prey relationships and lower habitat stability, respectively, in the more connected sites. Assemblage composition and some of the trait-based metrics were sensitive to a flood that occurred before one of the sampling dates. Some of the trait-based metrics showed potential for explaining floodplain invertebrate assemblages and for monitoring postrestoration conditions in floodplain water bodies. However, the metrics were developed initially for studies of lotic systems and their use in heterogeneous floodplain water bodies will require further investigation, e.g., delineation of reference conditions for trait-based metrics.

AB Growth rate of the Kuruma prawn, Marsupenaeus japonicus is an important economic trait, with larger animals commanding higher market prices. To identify gene markers associated with growth, a genetic map of a full-sib F-2 intercross family of M. japonicus has previously been generated and quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing weight, total length, and carapace length were identified. In this study, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers associated with the major QTL region, contributing 16% to phenotypic variation, were characterized. Flanking sequence has been obtained and allelic variants responsible for segregation patterns of these markers have been identified. The genomic sequence surrounding the AFLP band 7.21a, residing under the QTL peak, contains a gene sequence homologous to the elongation of very long chain fatty acids-like (ELOVL) protein family. A full-length mRNA (ELOVL-MJ) encoding this protein was isolated from M. japonicus, representing both the first ELOVL gene in crustacea and the first candidate gene identified via QTL studies in crustacea.

AB The marine interstitial polychaete Stygocapitella subterranea is characterized by aberrant morphological and biological traits resembling those of clitellates and Hrabeiella periglandulata, a terrestrial polychaete species. Although clearly related to the terrestrial Parergodrilus heideri, there are distinct differences in their morphology. An ultrastructural study of the male genital organs was undertaken to look for common apomorphic features in Parergodrilidae, to find structural evidence for clarifying their reproductive biology and mode of sperm transfer. Finally it should be elucidated whether a supposed sister-group relationship of Parergodrilidae and Orbiniidae based on molecular evidence can be supported by morphological characters as well. In S. subterranea the male organs consist of an impaired seminal vesicle, a pair of sperm ducts and two large tube-like prostate glands. These glands constitute the distal parts of the gonoducts and open ventrally on a small genital papilla in chaetiger 9. True copulatory organs or organs for storage of mature sperm are lacking. The seminal vesicle is a coelomic cavity composed of two apposed coelomic linings supplied with blood spaces. The testes are found ventrally. The prostate glands are covered by a single layer of muscle fibres running in a longitudinal/ spiral direction along the gland. There are no signs of spermatophore formation in any part of the male system. Since females always carry sperm, pseudocopulation can be excluded and the, likelihood of either direct transfer of sperm or hypodermic injection is discussed. The structure of genital organs reveals similarities to those of P. heideri. Gonochorism, paired seminal vesicles and two pairs of male gonoducts opening in chaetigers 9 and 10 with a distal glandular part most likely belong to the ground pattern of Parergodrilidae. The observations confirm that consistencies with either clitellates or H. periglandulata are the result of convergent evolutionary events. On the other hand, the relationship of Parergodrilidae to an orbiniid/ questid clade receives support from the present data.

AB Complex physiological traits, such as routine aerobic metabolic rate or exercise performance, are indicators of the functional integrity of fish that can reveal sub-lethal toxicological effects of aquatic pollutants. These traits have proved valuable in laboratory investigations of the sub-lethal effects of heavy metals, ammonia and various xenobiotics. It is not known, however, whether they can also function as biomarkers of the complex potential range of effects upon overall functional integrity caused by exposure to mixtures of chemicals in polluted natural environments. The current study used portable swimming respirometers to compare exercise performance and respiratory metabolism of fish exposed in cages for three weeks to either clean or polluted sites on three urban European river systems: the river Lambro, Milan, Italy; the rivers Blythe, Cole and Tame, Birmingham, UK; and the river Amstel, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The UK and Italian rivers were variously polluted with high levels of both bioavailable heavymetals and organics, and the Amstel by mixtures of bioavailable organics at high concentrations. In both the UK and Italy, indigenous chub (Leuciscus cephalus) exposed to clean or polluted sites swam equally well in an initial performance test, but the chub from polluted sites could not repeat this performance after a brief recovery interval. These animals were unable to raise the metabolic rate and allocate oxygen towards exercise in the second trial, an effect confirmed in successive campaigns in Italy. Swimming performance was therefore a biomarker indicator of pollutant exposure in chub exposed at these sites. Exposure to polluted sites on the river Amstel did not affect the repeat swimming performance of cultured cloned carp ( Cyprinus carpio), indicating either a species-specific tolerance or relative absence of heavy metals. However, measurements of oxygen uptake during swimming revealed increased rates of routine aerobic metabolism in both chub and carp at polluted sites in all of the rivers studied, indicating a sub-lethal metabolic loading effect. Therefore, the physiological traits of exercise performance and metabolic rate have potential as biomarkers of the overall sub-lethal toxic effects of exposure to complex mixtures of pollutants in rivers, and may also provide insight into why fish do not colonize some polluted environments.

AB Macro-ecological theories relating species richness, abundance, range size, biological traits and environmental tolerance have rarely been tested in marine soft-sediments, despite the spatial extent of these habitats and the inherent richness of resident communities. This study examines the contribution of rare species to marine soft-sediment communities from New Zealand, focussing on the relationships of range size with abundance, environment, habitat diversity and life history traits. 54% of the 351 species sampled exhibited restricted ranges (found at <= 2 sites). In contrast to many terrestrial systems, we observed only a weak positive relationship between abundance and frequency of occurrence. Restricted-range species were not randomly distributed, with their distribution related to habitat characteristics, suggesting an important link between habitat diversity and rarity. They exhibited a similar range of traits to the total observed species pool, suggesting that they are not only important to biodiversity but could play a role in stability. Restricted range species were generally not small and this, together with the number of different biological traits represented, suggests that rare species are important to the functioning of marine systems. Thus, our results highlight the importance of considering rare species in habitat-based approaches to conservation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The giant sea anemone Condylactis gigantea associates with members of two clades of the dinoflagellate alga Symbiodinium, either singly or in mixed infection, as revealed by clade-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction of large subunit ribosomal DNA. To explore the functional significance of this molecular variation, the fate of photosynthetically fixed carbon was investigated by C-14 radiotracer experiments. Symbioses with algae of clades A and B released ca. 30-40% of fixed carbon to the animal tissues. Incorporation into the lipid fraction and the low molecular weight fraction dominated by amino acids was significantly higher in symbioses with algae of clade A than of clade B, suggesting that the genetically different algae in C. gigantea are not functionally equivalent. Symbioses with mixed infections yielded intermediate values, such that this functional trait of the symbiosis can be predicted from the traits of the contributing algae. Coral and sea anemone symbioses with Symbiodinium break down at elevated temperature, a process known as 'coral bleaching'. The functional response of the C. gigantea symbiosis to heat stress varied between the algae of clades A and B, with particularly depressed incorporation of photosynthetic carbon into lipid of the clade B algae, which are more susceptible to high temperature than the algae of clade A. This study provides a first exploration of how the core symbiotic function of photosynthate transfer to the host varies with the genotype of Symbiodinium, an algal symbiont which underpins corals and, hence, coral reef ecosystems.

AB Light is one of the most important factors affecting marine phytoplankton growth, and its variability in time and space strongly influences algal performance and success. The hypothesis tested in this work is that the activity of the xanthophyll cycle and the development of nonphotochemical quenching could be considered a functional trait of algal diversity. If this hypothesis is true, a relationship must exist between fast-activated pigment variations linked to photoprotective behavior and the ecology of the species. This assumption was tested on three diatoms: Skeletonema marinoi Sarno et Zingone, Thalassiosira rotula Meunier, and Chaetoceros socialis Lauder. These three diatoms occupy different ecological niches. Strains of these diatoms were subjected to five changes in irradiance. Xanthophyll-cycle activity, quantum yield of fluorescence, and electron transport rate were the main parameters determined. There were marked interspecific differences in xanthophyll-cycle activity, and these differences were dependent on the light history of the cells. Chaetoceros socialis responded efficiently to changing irradiance, which might relate to its dominance during the spring bloom in some coastal areas. In contrast, T. rotula responded with a slower photoprotection activation, which seems to reflect its more offshore ecological distribution. The photoresponse of S. marinoi (a late-winter coastal species blooming in the Adriatic Sea) was light-history dependent, becoming photoinhibited under high light when acclimated to low light, but capable of reaching a high photoprotection level when acclimated to moderate light. Our hypothesis on the photoprotection capacity as a functional trait in microalgae seems to be validated given the results of this study.

AB When confronted with a swarm of their prey, many predators become confused and are less successful in their attacks. Despite the general notion that this confusion effect is a major reason for prey swarm formation, it is largely unknown how widespread it is and which predator or prey traits facilitate or impede it. We carried out experiments with four predator-prey systems: Aeshna and Chaoborus larvae, but not Libellula and Triturus larvae, became confused when confronted with high Daphnia densities. When combining this result with literature data, we found that predators became confused in 16 of the 25 predator-prey systems studied to date. Tactile predators appear to be generally susceptible, whereas visual predators are susceptible mainly when their prey is highly agile. This difference probably results from the superiority of the visual sensory system. However, while our study is an important step towards the mechanistic understanding of predator confusion, it also reveals how poor this understanding currently is.

AB The relationship between form and function has been a central organizing principle in biology throughout its history as a formal science. This concept has been relevant from molecules to organisms but loses meaning at population and community levels where study targets are abstract collectives and assemblages. Ecosystems include organisms and abiotic factors but ecosystem ecology too has developed until recently without a strong spatially explicit reference. Landscape ecology provides an opportunity to once again anneal form and function and to consider reciprocal causation between them. This ecomorphologic view can be applied at a variety of ecologically relevant scales and consists of an investigation of how geomorphology provides a structural template that shapes, and is shaped by ecological processes. Running water ecosystems illustrate several principles governing the interaction of landscape form and ecological function subsumed by the concept of "Functional Ecomorphology". Particularly lucrative are ecosystem-level interactions between geologic form and biogeochemical processes integrated by hydrologic flowpaths. While the utility of a flowpath-based approach is most apparent in streams, spatially explicit biogeochemical processing pervades all landscapes and may be of general ecological application.

AB There is a paucity of large-scale field investigations on the effects of organic toxicants on stream macro invertebrate community structure and ecosystem functions. We investigated a total of 29 streams in two study areas of France and Finland for pesticide exposure, invertebrates and leaf-litter breakdown. To link pesticide exposure and community composition we applied the trait-based Species At Risk (SPEAR) indicator system.
   In the French region, pesticide stress was associated with a decrease in the relative abundance and number of sensitive species in the communities. The presence of undisturbed upstream reaches partly compensated the effects of pesticide contamination. Functional effects of pesticides were identified by a 2.5-fold reduction of the leaf-litter breakdown rate that was closely correlated with the structural changes in the contaminated streams. No effects of pesticides were observed in Finnish streams since contamination with pesticides was very low.
   In a follow-up analysis, the SPEAR approach successfully discriminated between reference and contaminated sites across different biogeographical regions, also including results of a previous field study in North Germany. Furthermore, change of the community structure was detectable at a concentration range as low as 1/100 to 1/1000 the acute 48 h-LC50 of Daphnia magna.
   Our findings demonstrate that pesticides may influence the structure and function of lotic ecosystems and that the SPEAR approach can be used as a powerful tool in biomonitoring over large spatial scales. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We asked whether species richness or species identity contributed more to ecosystem function in a trait-based functional group, burrowing, filter-feeding bivalves (freshwater mussels: Unionidae), and whether their importance changed with environmental context and species composition. We conducted a manipulative experiment in a small river examining the effects of mussel assemblages varying from one to eight species on benthic algal standing crop across two sets of environmental conditions: extremely low discharge and high water temperature (summer); and moderate discharge and water temperature (fall). We found strong species identity effects within this guild, with one species (Actinonaias ligamentina) influencing accrual of benthic algae more than other species, but only under summer conditions. We suspect that this effect is due to a combination of the greater biomass of this species and its higher metabolic and excretion rates at warm Summer temperatures, resulting in increased nitrogen subsidies to benthic algae. We also found that Actinonaias influenced the condition of other mussel species, likely through higher consumption, interference, or both. This study demonstrates that species within trait-based functional groups do not necessarily have the same effects on ecosystem properties, particularly under different environmental conditions.

AB Various methods have been devised to classify plants into functional groups, yet little work has investigated how these groups differentially impact succession with spatially explicit mechanisms. In a sand dune plant community on Galveston Island, Texas, we categorized plants by their functional traits, mapped the topographical contours of the sand dunes as a first-order effect to describe the spatial distribution of environmental stress, and quantified the second-order within- and between-group associations of the plants within specific bands of these contours using Ripley's K analysis. We then quantified the influence of spatially explicit functional traits on the direction of succession over time. We found evidence that the spatial pattern of the plants at one time exerted an influence on the pattern of the plants at a later time, based on their functional traits, thereby influencing the direction of sand dune succession. This study describes the spatiotemporal mechanics that lie behind sand dune plant succession: a process that has been a classical example of facilitation for ecologists, a plant community that is at risk from global sea-level rise and hurricanes, and an important rangeland resource that is being restored around the world for its ecological, range production, and coastal protection value.

AB Based on morphological analyses, hippos have traditionally been classified as Suiformes, along with pigs and peccaries. However, molecular data indicate hippos and cetaceans are sister taxa (see review in Uhen, 2007, this issue). This study analyzes soft tissue characters of the pygmy hippo forelimb to elucidate the functional anatomy and evolutionary relationships of hippos within Artiodactyla. Two specimens from the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C. were dissected, revealing several adaptations to an aquatic lifestyle. However, these adaptations differ functionally from most aquatic mammals as hippos walk along river or lake bottoms, rather than swim. Several findings highlight a robust mechanism for propelling the trunk forward through the water. For example, mm. pectoralis superficialis and profundus demonstrate broad sites of origin, while the long flexor tendons serve each of the digits, reflecting the fact that all toes are weight-bearing. Pygmy hippos also have eight mm. interossei and a well-developed m. lumbricalis IV. Retention of intrinsic adductors functions to prevent splaying of the toes, an advantageous arrangement in an animal walking on muddy substrates. Published descriptions indicate common hippos share all of these features. Hippo and ruminant forelimbs share several traits; however, hippos are unique among artiodactyls in retaining several primitive muscles (e.g., mm. palmaris longus and flexor digitorum brevis). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that hippos diverged from other Artiodactyla early in the history of this group. Additional analyses of hindlimb and axial muscles may help determine whether this trajectory was closely allied to that of Cetacea.

AB We assessed species-specific coverage (km(2)) of a submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) community in the fresh and upper oligohaline Potomac Estuary from 1985 to 2001 using a method combining field observations of species-proportional coverage data with congruent remotely sensed coverage and density (percent canopy cover) data. Biomass (estimated by density-weighted coverage) of individual species was calculated. Under improving water quality conditions, exotic SAV species did not displace native SAV; rather, the percent of natives increased over time. While coverage-based diversity did fluctuate and increased, richness-based community turnover rates were not significantly different from zero. SAV diversity was negatively related to nitrogen concentration. Differences in functional traits, such as reproductive potential, between the dominant native and exotic species may explain some interannual patterns in SAV. Biomass of native, as well as exotic, SAV species varied with factors affecting water column light attenuation. We also show a positive response by a higher trophic level, waterfowl, to SAV communities dominated by exotic SAV from 1959 to 2001.

AB A range of biological traits of nematode species were combined to identify patterns in the functional composition of their assemblages collected at 19 soft-bottom stations in the southwestern North, Sea with the primary aim to determine which environmental variables control communities. We used 19 categories of five biological traits thought or known to represent an important ecological function. These were related to buccal morphology, tail shape, body size, body shape and life history strategy. Data on trait membership was provided by biological information on species and genera. A total of 79 different trait combinations were recorded. Results from correlation analyses revealed several significant relationships between traits. Some trait combinations were shared by different species and genera, and the ratio of realised versus total number of possible trait combinations of < 1 suggested that some trait combinations were not represented by the nematode fauna from this region. The functional composition of nematodes was strongly linked to median particle diameter and silt content of the sediment and water depth. The approach adopted and our attempts at defining and analysing functional attributes of nematode communities raised a number of conceptual and methodological issues which are discussed.

AB I apply a comparative, functional group approach to coastal sandplain grassland taxa in order to examine whether rare plant species share certain aspects of rarity and life history characters that are distinct from their more common, co-occurring congeners in these habitats. I compiled a comparative data set containing 16 variables describing biogeographic distributions, level of imperilment, habitat specialization, vegetative versus sexual reproduction, seed dispersal, and dormancy of 27 closely-related pairs of plant species that contrast in their abundance (infrequent versus common) in coastal sandplain grasslands. Frequent and infrequent species were paired within genera (or closely related genera) and thus distributed equivalently across families to control for phylogenetic bias. Paired comparisons revealed that infrequent species were intrinsically rarer range-wide, and exhibited a narrower range and more habitat specialization than their common relatives. A classification tree distinguished infrequent species from common species on the basis of higher habitat specialization, larger seed size, smaller plant height, less reliance less on vegetative (colonial) reproduction, and tendency toward annual or biennial life history. Research and management steps to reduce competition from larger-satured, colonial, perennial species are recommended for these infrequent species. Basic research involving more species and more data on ecophysiological characters, demography, and competitive interactions are needed to identify critical life history traits that will influence responses to particular management regimes.

AB Background and Aims Post-fire regeneration is a key process in Mediterranean shrubland dynamics, strongly determining the functional properties of the community. In this study, a test is carried out to deteremine whether there is co-variation between species regenerative types and functional attributes related to water use.
   Methods An analysis was made of the seasonal variations in leaf relative water content (RWC), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf moisture (LM) and live fine fuel moisture (LFFM) in 30 woody species of a coastal shrubland, with different post-fire regenerative strategies (seeding, resprouting or both).
   Key Results RWC results suggest that the studied resprouters have more efficient mechanisms to reduce water losses and maintain water supply between seasons. In contrast, seeders are more drought tolerant. LDMC is higher in resprouters over the course of the year, suggesting a more efficient conservation of nutrients. The weight of the phylogenetic constraint to understand differences between regenerative strategies tends to be important for LDMC, while it is not the case for variables such as RWC.
   Conclusions Groups of species with different post-fire regenerative strategies (seeders and resprouters) have different functional traits related to water use. In addition to the role of phylogenetical constraints, these differences are also likely to be related to the respective life history characteristics. Therefore, the presence and abundance of species with different post-fire regenerative responses influence the functional properties of the communities.

AB This paper summarises the outcomes of the 14th Workshop of the International Association of Phytoplankton Taxonomy and Ecology (IAP). The authors mostly addressed their contributions on the following topics: morphological and morpho-functional descriptors of phytoplankton, size and shape structure of phytoplankton related to different kinds of environmental variables and the role of morphological and physiological plasticity of phytoplankton in maintaining the (apparently) same populations under different environmental conditions. Case studies from different kinds of aquatic environments (deep and shallow lakes, reservoirs with different age, purpose and trophic state, floodplain wetlands mostly in the temperate region but also from subtropical and tropical ones) have shown that similar environmental forcing calls for similar morpho-functional properties even though the corresponding associations can be markedly different on species level.

AB Plant functional traits vary both along environmental gradients and among species occupying similar conditions, creating a challenge for the synthesis of functional and community ecology. We present a trait-based approach that provides an additive decomposition of species' trait values into alpha and beta components: beta values refer to a species' position along a gradient defined by community-level mean trait values; alpha values are the difference between a species' trait values and the mean of co-occurring taxa. In woody plant communities of coastal California, beta trait values for specific leaf area, leaf size, wood density and maximum height all covary strongly, reflecting species distributions across a gradient of soil moisture availability. Alpha values, on the other hand, are generally not significantly correlated, suggesting several independent axes of differentiation within communities. This trait-based framework provides a novel approach to integrate functional ecology and gradient analysis with community ecology and coexistence theory.

AB The fundamental idea behind the study of biodiversity patterns is the presumed connection between the shape of species assemblages and the functional ways in which they are organized, this functional organization referring to how species are related to one another, as competitors or members of a web of interactions and to how species are facing similar environmental constraints. Amongst the different facets of biodiversity, functional diversity is certainly a key for ecosystem processes in coastal areas. However, surprisingly, patterns of functional diversity have received little attention until now. After presenting a common framework linking functional diversity patterns to species coexistence theories, the aim of our study was twofold: (1) to seek assembly rules in brackish lagoon fish communities drove by functional traits. To this aim we used null models to examine the influence of two opposing forces acting on community structure: interspecific competition that might prevent the coexistence of the most similar species, and environmental filters that might result in the most similar species to coexist. (2) To seek relationships between fish functional diversity and environmental gradients, if any. Fish sampling was carried out in two coastal lagoons where stations differ considerably in terms of physicochemical parameters. Using morphological functional traits, functional diversity of fish communities was estimated using two recently published indices as well as a new proposed index. Firstly our study was not able to demonstrate a limitation of similarity in coexisting lagoon fishes due to interspecific competition. Conversely our results support the niche filtering hypothesis preventing species too dissimilar from one another to co-occur at the same station. Secondly, salinity was positively related to the functional diversity of fishes in both lagoons suggesting that within species assemblages near the channel species are less redundant than at stations far from the channel where species tend to be functionally similar (benthic and eating zooplankton).

AB We measured water leaving reflectance, phytoplankton pigments, optical properties and photosynthetic parameters in the southern Benguela ecosystem in October 2002. These data were used to validate MERIS standard products: reflectance (MERIS wavelengths) and Case 1 Chlorophyll- a. In this heterogeneous area, accurate validation required sampling within a few minutes of the satellite overpass. Inter-pigment relationships e. g. Total Chlorophyll (TChla) to Total Pigment (TP) were robust (R-2 similar to 0.99) yet pigment ratios (TChla/TP) were not constant (range 0.44 to 0.62) increasing log-linearly with biomass (R-2 similar to 0.7). Photosynthetic parameters (e. g. Photosynthetic Quantum Efficiency, PQE) and optical ratios (a(676)/a(440)) also increased log-linearly with biomass (R-2 similar to 0.8). PQE, pigment and optical ratios were linearly inter-correlated (R-2 similar to 0.7 to 0.8). From these data we derived the bio-optical traits for several phytoplankton functional types (PFTs): micro-plankton (diatoms and dinoflagellates) had high biomass, pigment ratios and PQE; nano-flagellates had low to intermediate biomass, pigment ratios and PQE; prokaryotes had very low biomass, pigment ratios and PQE. We present MERIS data analysed for PFTs and new products (PQE).

AB The River Continuum Concept (RCC) explains the structural and functional characteristics of stream communities focusing on the gradually changing physical components from headwaters to downstream habitats of streams and rivers. The global value of the RCC is still uncertain, possibly because physical factors (e.g., altitude and then temperature, stream order, channel width) can vary differently in longitudinal river axes across the world. Moreover, RCC predictions in relation to different physical factors have not been tested adequately in different biomes, especially biomes outside of temperate North America. Here, we report on the functional structure of macroinvertebrate communities in neotropical streams from Bolivia along a broad altitudinal gradient (from 1120 to 4300 m a.s.l.), aiming to understand how altitude can affect the longitudinal changes in functional feeding groups (FFG) and richness predicted by the RCC. The RCC predictions for functional structure were not completely matched when analyzing FFGs in relation to an index of longitudinal stream gradient. However, after removing the effect of altitude by using residuals from regressions between FFGs and altitude, FFG patterns matched RCC predictions more closely. We detected significant relationships between altitude and the relative abundance of collector-gatherers, shredders and scrapers which may be related to changes in temperature, UV radiation and canopy cover along the altitudinal gradient. Our results indicate that altitude combined with position along the longitudinal gradient is an important factor governing the FFG structure of macro invertebrate communities in neotropical streams.

AB Previously tested in temperate ecoregions, the River Habitat Templet concept provides a framework for relating the characteristics of species (i.e. traits indicating species ecological functions) to habitat attributes. As species traits are comparable among most faunal groups, they can be used to examine community patterns in ecological functions at a large spatial scale, even across areas that differ in the taxonomic composition of their communities. If local physical attributes produce similar trait patterns on a global scale, the River Habitat Templet can serve as a general predictive too] of community characteristics regardless of geographical zones. We studied eight biological traits in 82 neotropical taxa: i) food, ii) feeding habits, iii) respiration, iv) maximum body size, v) body flexibility, vi) body form, vii) specific adaptation to flow constraints and viii) mobility and attachment to substratum. A multivariate approach was used to examine taxonomic and functional (trait) differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages among study sites. Proportions of trait modalities were examined in relation to Froude number, substratum roughness and benthic organic matter availability at mesohabitat scale. Even if communities differed taxonomically, they were functionally similar. Thirty of 46 trait modalities of neotropical aquatic taxa were significantly related to at least one selected environmental attribute. The results clearly support the habitat templet as a major driver of macro invertebrate community structure in neotropical running waters. But the observed 'trait/ habitat' relationships did not sufficiently match those from temperate areas for us to confirm the existence of general rules organizing functional trait structure among benthic invertebrate communities that would be applicable in different climatic regions.

AB Plant roots may be linked by shared or common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) that constitute pathways for the transfer of resources among plants. The potential for water transfer by such networks was examined by manipulating CMNs independently of plant roots in order to isolate the role(s) of ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) networks in the plant water balance during drought (soil water potential -5.9 MPa). Fluorescent tracer dyes and deuterium-enriched water were used to follow the pathways of water transfer from coastal live oak seedlings (Quercus agrifolia Nee; colonized by EM and AMF) conducting hydraulic lift (HL) into the roots of water-stressed seedlings connected only by EM (Q. agrifolia) or AMF networks (Q. agrifolia, Eriogonum fasciculatum Benth., Salvia mellifera Greene, Keckiella antirrhinoides Benth). When connected to donor plants by hyphal linkages, deuterium was detected in the transpiration flux of receiver oak plants, and dye-labelled extraradical hyphae, rhizomorphs, mantles, and Hartig nets were observed in receiver EM oak roots, and in AMF hyphae of Salvia. Hyphal labelling was scarce in Eriogonum and Keckiella since these species are less dependent on AMF. The observed patterns of dye distribution also indicated that only a small percentage of mycorrhizal roots and extraradical hyphae were involved with water transfer among plants. Our results suggest that the movement of water by CMNs is potentially important to plant survival during drought, and that the functional ecophysiological traits of individual mycorrhizal fungi may be a component of this mechanism.

AB The magnitude of different sources of variation in coral reef fish abundance data needs to be known if temporal changes in population and community data are to be correctly estimated. A particularly important missing component of the variability is the 'instantaneous' change in fish, largely caused by the interaction between fish movement and observer recognition. This variation occurs at a time scale less than that influenced by the focus of previous studies, including time of day, tides, migration, or birth and death processes. Without this measure of variance, estimates of temporal change are confounded. To determine the magnitude of this instantaneous variance, belt-transect visual counts of damselfish, surgeonfish, and parrotfish were conducted during a short interval at midday during neap tides over consecutive days in the calm season and compared to similar samples in 1992 ano 2003. Within-site, or our estimate of instantaneous variation, was the greatest source of variability for the whole assemblage and for the surgeonfish/parrotfish group but not for damselfish. Direct between-year comparisons produced estimates of population change over time that were twice as high as those derived by an indirect method where the instantaneous spatial component was subtracted from the total variation. Because the inherent spatial component of variability makes it difficult to detect site change over time, we recommend sampling designs that use random sampling and have greater statistical power to detect change. Furthermore, aggregate metrics, such as numbers of species or density at the family, community, or the functional group, will have greater potential to detect change for sample sizes typical of coral reef studies. Otherwise, when life history traits and species level change are important, high replication will be required.

AB Fauna have been found to regulate important biogeochemical properties and ecosystem functions in benthic environments. In this study, we focused on how functional biodiversity and species-specific traits of benthic macrofauna affect key ecosystem functions related to organic matter mineralization and cycling of nutrients in surface sediments. Dominant benthic invertebrates from the Baltic Sea and the Skagerrak were classified into functional groups in accordance with their behaviour, feeding and sediment reworking activities. Macrofauna species were added in different combinations to defaunated Baltic sediments in 2 parallel microcosm systems fuelled with brackish and marine water. In total, there were 12 treatments that differed in terms of functional diversity of benthic fauna. The experiments demonstrated that faunal activities directly affected benthic oxygen and nutrient fluxes, sediment reactivity and pore-water distribution under both Baltic and Skagerrak conditions. Benthic fluxes, sediment reactivity and pore-water distribution were similar in Baltic and Skagerrak treatments, in which the same functional biodiversity and species-specific traits of benthic macrofauna were observed. Although no significant effects of functional biodiversity could be detected under Baltic or Skagerrak conditions, treatments with bioturbating fauna from the Skagerrak enhanced oxygen consumption and nutrient fluxes compared to treatments with Baltic fauna and Skagerrak fauna with functional groups similar (parallel) to the Baltic fauna. Moreover, speciesspecific traits related to the Skagerrak fauna (e.g. the thalassinid shrimp Calocarls macandreae) exceeded the effects of all other faunal treatments. This suggests that species-specific traits of macrofauna may override species richness and functional biodiversity of macrofauna when regulating important ecosystem properties and functions in benthic environments.

AB Members of the Bacteroidetes, formerly known as the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides (CFB) phylum, are among the major taxa of marine heterotrophic bacterioplankton frequently found on macroscopic organic matter particles (marine snow). In addition, they have been shown to also represent a significant part of free-living microbial assemblages in nutrient-rich microenvironments. Their abundance and distribution pattern in combination with enzymatic activity studies has led to the notion that organisms of this group are specialists for degradation of high molecular weight compounds in both the dissolved and particulate fraction of the marine organic matter pool, implying a major role of Bacteroidetes in the marine carbon cycle. Despite their ecological importance, comprehensive molecular data on organisms of this group have been scarce so far. Here we report on the first whole genome analysis of a marine Bacteroidetes representative, 'Gramella forsetii' KT0803. Functional analysis of the predicted proteome disclosed several traits which in joint consideration suggest a clear adaptation of this marine Bacteroidetes representative to the degradation of high molecular weight organic matter, such as a substantial suite of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes, a predicted preference for polymeric carbon sources and a distinct capability for surface adhesion.

AB The use of species traits to characterize the functional composition of benthic invertebrate communities has become well established in the ecological literature. This approach holds much potential for predicting changes of both species and species assemblages along environmental gradients in terms of traits that are sensitive to local environmental conditions. Further, in the burgeoning field of biomonitoring, a functional approach provides a predictive basis for understanding community-level responses along gradients of environmental alteration caused by humans. Despite much progress in recent years, the full potential of the functional traits-based approach is currently limited by several factors, both conceptual and methodological. Most notably, we lack adequate understanding of how individual traits are intercorrelated and how this lack of independence among traits reflects phylogenetic (evolutionary) constraint. A better understanding is needed if we are to make the transition from a largely univariate approach that considers single-trait responses along single environmental gradients to a multivariate one that more realistically accounts for the responses of many traits across multiple environmental gradients characteristic of most human-dominated landscapes. Our primary objective in this paper is to explore the issue of inter-trait correlations for lotic insects and to identify opportunities and challenges for advancing the theory and application of traits-based approaches in stream community ecology. We created a new database on species-trait composition of North American lotic insects. Using published accounts and expert opinion, we collected information on 20 species traits (in 59 trait states) that fell into 4 broad categories: life-history morphological, mobility, and ecological. First, we demonstrate the importance of considering how the linkage of specific trait states within a taxon is critical to developing a more-robust traits-based community ecology. Second, we examine the statistical correlations among traits and trait states for the 311 taxa to identify trait syndromes and specify which traits provide unique (uncorrelated) information that can be used to guide trait selection in ecological studies. Third, we examine the evolutionary associations among traits by mapping trait states onto a phylogentic tree derived from morphological and molecular analyses and classifications from the literature. We examine the evolutionary lability of individual traits by assessing the extent to which they are unconstrained by phylogenic relationships across the taxa. By focusing on the lability of traits within lotic genera of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, taxa often used as water-quality indicators, we show how a traits-based approach can allow a priori expectations of the differential response of these taxa to specific environmental gradients. We conclude with some ideas about how specific trait linkages, statistical correlations among traits, and evolutionary lability of traits can be used in combination with a mechanistic understanding of trait response along environmental gradients to select robust traits useful for a more predictive community ecology. We indicate how these new insights can direct the research in statistical modeling that is necessary to achieve the full potential of models that can predict how multiple traits will respond along multiple environmental gradients.

AB Question: To what extent do surrogate approaches to vegetation description provide equivalent data and estimates of the patterns of variability in species composition to that which Would be obtained using species-level abundance data?
   Locations: Picos de Europa in Northern Spain and South Uist, Outer Hebrides, Scotland, UK.
   Methods: Percentage cover data were collected from 117 plots in montane and sub-alpine grassland and woodland mosaics in the Picos de Europa and 217 quadrats across a gradient from temperate coastal duties to upland grassland and heath on South Uist. From these data, 14 surrogate datasets were derived using supra-species (genus, family) levels of description, presence-absence, life form, growth form and plant functional types (PFTs; derived from seven easily measurable traits). The descriptive power of each of the 14 Surrogate datasets in each area, relative to the original cover abundance dataset, was assessed by 'second stage' analysis, based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient calculated between pairs of similarity matrices.
   Results: In both areas, presence-absence data showed the closest similarities to the original cover abundance data, followed by data generalised at supra-species level. PFT, life form, growth form and leaf trait data were less similar.
   Conclusions: Many situations exist where it may be more efficient or desirable to collect neither species nor abundance data and to use appropriate surrogates. The results demonstrate clearly that the information content of surrogate datasets in our study may be an acceptable substitute. These ideas merit further investigation in a wider range of habitats and contexts.

AB This study examines the molecular-genetic divergence and evolution of Australian aquatic micro-Crustacea Daphnia and Daphniopsis. The results indicate that species of Daphniopsis are accommodated within the genus Daphnia. Although their phyletic integrity is no longer supported, all Daphniopsis species (save one from North America) form a monophyletic group and may warrant subgeneric recognition pending further systematic investigations. A total of five lineages are shown to occupy Australian inland waters, including an endemic subgenus (Australodaphnia) and representatives of the subgenus Ctenodaphnia. The subgenera (Daphnia and Hyalodaphnia) that dominate the North American fauna are absent in Australia. The large extent of sequence divergence among major groups suggests that continental isolation has helped shape the early evolution of daphniids. More recent speciation is also evident, particularly by the Daphnia carinata species complex, whose numbers have grown to 13 members by the addition of a species previously assigned to the nominal subgenus and species yet to be formally described. The molecular data provide more evidence that the colonization of distinct habitats and ecological settings is a key factor in spurring diversification in the genus, while also modulating the pace of molecular evolution. This study attributes habitat-specific molecular clocks to the intense ultraviolet (UV) exposure in both saline and transparent oligohaline waters. Adaptations to these harsh environments by at least four independent lineages include the convergent acquisition of a melanic carapace. Yet some lineages, clearly under mutational duress, lack this commonly acquired protective trait. There are numerous adaptive lines of defense against UV damage, including the complex regulatory mechanisms required to initiate a cellular response to guard and repair DNA. Functional molecular studies may soon challenge a notion built on morphology that convergence is the general directive to Daphnia's ecological and evolutionary success.

AB Transgenic technologies provide a promising means by which desirable traits can be introduced into cultured fish species within a single generation thus accelerating the production of genetically superior broodstock for aquaculture. However, before such fish are allowed to be marketed as food they must receive government regulatory approval. Two pivotal regulatory requirements are: (1) complete characterization of the genomically integrated transgene and, (2) demonstration that the transgene remains stable over multiple generations. We have generated a stable line of growth hormone (GH) transgenic Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) using an "all fish" gene construct (opAFP-GHc2) containing a growth hormone cDNA from chinook salmon whose expression is regulated by the 5' promoter and 3' termination regions derived from an ocean pout antifreeze protein (AFP) gene. In this study we show that a reorganized form of the opAFP-GHc2 construct (termed EO-1 alpha) integrated as a single functional copy into a 35 bp repeat region of the genomic DNA. PCR based mapping revealed that the linear sequence of the EO-1 alpha integrant was organized as follows: base pairs 1580-2193 of the ocean pout promoter region followed by the intact chinook salmon GH cDNA, the complete ocean pout antifreeze 3' region, and the first 1678 bp of the ocean pout antifreeze 5' region. Sequence analysis of the EO-1 alpha integrant and genomic flanking regions in F-2 and F-4 generation salmon revealed that they were identical. In addition, apart from the disruption at the integration sites, the consensus sequences of the integrant in these two generations of salmon were identical to the sequence of the opAFP-GHc2 construct. These results indicate that the EO-1 alpha transgene codes for the chinook salmon GH, and that the transgene and the integration site have remained stable over multiple generations.

   INDEX
AB 1. Transitional waters, described as critical transition zones because of their position at terrestrial, freshwater and marine interfaces, provide essential goods and services to the biosphere including human populations. These ecotones face increasing human influence mainly due to population density increase in coastal areas.
   2. Transitional water bodies have, to date, received little attention in the development of ecological status indicators, this is a critical deficiency when trying to meet the Water Framework Directive objective of all significant water bodies achieving good ecological status by the year 2015.
   3. In order to assess changes in transitional water communities many taxonomic-based indicators have already been proposed but there are a number of concerns for their use such as taxonomic classification difficulties, their unsuitability for multi-site comparisons and their inconsistent relationships with disturbance or stress.
   4. Alternative methods based on body size, abundance distribution among functional groups, functional diversity and productivity descriptors are proposed. These methods offer the opportunity to compare sites with different taxonomic compositions and allow derivation of indicators related to ecological status of communities under scrutiny.
   5. Finally, the suitability of these taxonomic-free descriptors to provide relevant information for each of the four main biotic compartments in coastal lagoons is discussed. The use of biomass distribution among functional groups for fish, benthos and macrophyte and to use body-size distribution for benthos and plankton is proposed.

AB Inshore waters of European coasts have accumulated a high share of non-indigenous species, where a changeable palaeoenvironment has caused low diversity in indigenous biota. Also strongly transformed modern coastal ecosystems seem to assimilate whatever species have been introduced and tolerate the physical regime. Adding non-native species does not have any directional predetermined effects on recipient coastal ecosystems. The status of being a non-native rather refers to a position in evolutionary history than qualify as an ecological category with distinct and consistent properties. Effects of invaders vary between habitats and with the phase of invasion and also with shifting ambient conditions. Although aliens accelerate change in European coastal biota, we found no evidence that they generally impair biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. More often, invaders expand ecosystem functioning by adding new ecological traits, intensifying existing ones and increasing functional redundancy.

AB The effects of variability in environmental conditions on species composition in benthic ecosystems are well established, but relatively little is known about how environmental variability relates to ecosystem functioning. Benthic invertebrate assemblages are heavily involved in the maintenance of ecological processes and investigation of the biological characteristics (traits) expressed in these assemblages can provide information about some aspects of functioning. The aim of this study was to establish and explore relationships between environmental variability and biological traits expressed in megafauna assemblages in two UK regions. Patterns of trait composition were matched to environmental conditions and subsets of variables best describing these patterns determined. The nature of the relationships were subsequently examined at two separate scales, both between and within the regions studied. Over the whole area, some traits related to size, longevity reproduction, mobility flexibility, feeding method, sociability and living habit were negatively correlated with salinity, sea surface temperature, annual temperature range and the level of fishing effort, and positively associated with fish taxon richness and shell content of the substratum. Between the two regions, reductions in temperature range and shell content were associated with infrequent relative occurrences of short-lived, moderately mobile, flexible, solitary, opportunistic, permanent-burrow dwelling fauna and those exhibiting reproductive strategies based on benthic development. Relationships between some traits and environmental conditions diverged within the two regions, with increases in fishing effort and shell content of the substratum being associated with low frequencies of occurrence of moderately mobile and moderately to highly flexible fauna within one region, but high frequencies in the other. These changes in trait composition have implications for ecosystem processes, with, for example, reductions in permanent-burrow dwellers within one of the regions potentially compromising the ability of the assemblages to process and store chemicals and waste products. However, the connections between environmental conditions and trait composition are complex and incorporate many factors. Experimental investigations will be necessary to determine the extent and consequences of these important relationships. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB We conducted a microcosm experiment with monocultures and all possible combinations of four aquatic hyphomycete species, Articulospora tetracladia, Flagellospora curta, Geniculospora grandis and Heliscus submersus, to examine the potential effects of species richness on three functional aspects: leaf litter decomposition (leaf mass loss), fungal production (ergosterol buildup) and reproductive effort (released spores). Both species richness and identity significantly affected fungal biomass and conidial production (number and biomass of released spores), whereas only species identity had a significant effect on leaf mass loss. In mixed cultures, all measures of fungal functions were greater than expected from the weighted performances of participating species in monoculture. Mixed cultures outperformed the most active monoculture for biomass accumulation but not for leaf mass loss and conidial production. The three examined aspects of aquatic hyphomycete activity tended to increase with species richness, and a complementary effect was unequivocally demonstrated for fungal biomass. Our results also suggest that specific traits of certain species may have a greater influence on ecosystem functioning than species number.

AB Biomechanical plasticity and within-species growth form diversity are traits that can facilitate invasion by non-native plant species. We support this argument with evidence from the invasion of coastal habitats in northern Florida, USA, by Schinus terebinthifolius and describe some of the consequences of this invasion for overtopped saltmarsh plants. In crowded stands, Schinus grows more like a vine than a tree, with stem height : diameter ratios nearly twice than those observed in open-grown individuals but with no changes in wood density or the modulus of elasticity of stem material. When extracted from the surrounding vegetation, the formerly crowded Schinus stems buckle under their own weight. Schinus crowns also extend much further over adjacent saltmarsh than crowns of Juniperus virginiana, the only other tree species abundant in the study site. Along forest edges, the above-ground biomass of saltmarsh plants overtopped by Schinus crowns was reduced by more than an order of magnitude. The biomechanical plasticity of Schinus allows it to adapt its growth form to suit habitat conditions and can dominate the edges of salt marshes as a sprawling shrub and maritime forests as either a free-standing tree or a woody vine, depending on stand crowding.

AB Feeding strategies are typical traits reflecting the adaptation of species to environmental conditions. This concept is currently developed in some water quality systems (e.g. Index of Trophic completeness) and the structure of functional feeding groups (FFGs) could form part of a unified measure across communities differing in taxonomic composition. However, in South America, information about the FFG classification of invertebrates in streams is almost absent and existing studies using FFG structure follows classification from North America. But even taxonomically related species may have different diets in tropical and temperate areas and therefore, studies about FFG structure in neotropics could be biased. For this reason, we determined diet composition, trophic level and FFGs, using gut contents analysis and mouthpart observations of 49 macroinvertebrate taxa (mostly at genus level) from neotropical streams. We observed that practically all macroinvertebrates fed upon fine detritus which indicates the importance of this food resource in neotropical streams. As the assignment to a single FFG does not accurately reflect the functional profile of taxa, we transcribed the affinity of taxa to each FFG using fuzzy codes. Finally, we published the coding of diet composition and FFG of the taxa examined, which could be used in future community analyses of lotic ecosystems in the Neotropical zone.

AB Currently, interest is growing in evaluating stream functional integrity while river assessment schemes are still exclusively based on structural indicators determined from various aquatic communities. Although some approaches relying on macroinvertebrate functional groups and combinations of traits have been advocated as means to assess ecosystem function, there has been no attempt to test the reliability of these methods with any direct functional indicator even though litter breakdown has been recently proposed as a functional indicator of stream impairment. The purpose of this study was to compare nine benthic macroinvertebrate-based structural metrics with functional metrics based on leaf litter breakdown in coarse and fine mesh bags in nine streams distributed along a eutrophication gradient. In coarse mesh bags, a 10-fold drop in breakdown rate of alder litter indicated a high sensitivity of this functional indicator to the deleterious effects of ammonium and its associated products, ammonia and nitrite. In contrast, microbial breakdown measured in fine mesh bags did not vary substantially along the gradient. Taxonomic and functional structures of macroinvertebrate assemblages were altered in the most eutrophic streams, as shown by drops in IBGN (French biotic index), BMWP (Britain biotic index) and EPTC (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Coleoptera) richness. Shredder richness and an ecological diversity index calculated from functional groups defined from multiple trait combinations exhibited the highest correlation with litter breakdown rate. Our results indicate that indirect assessment of stream functional integrity by structural indicators is realistic but requires specific metrics not necessarily based on traits or functional groups. Leaf litter breakdown is confirmed as a reliable indicator for direct assessment of streams impacted by eutrophication.

AB This study is part of a general project to analyse the biological and ecological mechanisms that influence the invasion of Mediterranean sand dune ecosystems by alien plants. In this paper we analyse the morphological and functional traits of coastal dune wild species (natives and aliens) based mainly on information from the literature. The most common 130 wild species occurring on the recent (Holocenic) coastal dunes were included considering the invasive status of alien plants. A comparative analysis of functional groups was performed through ordination techniques (PCoA using the Gower index). This reveals four functional groups related to the most important plant communities in coastal vegetation zonation. Alien plants were found in all functional groups and no trait or set of traits was specifically related to them. This indicates that aliens show similar traits to those natives growing in different communities of the coastal dune zonation, from the small beach annuals to the evergreen taller shrubs of the Mediterranean macchia. When the invasive status of alien species was taken into account, however, some differences emerged: a) casual aliens were found in almost all groups but their traits were not interpreted as being due to any particular adaptive strategy; b) naturalised aliens were only found in the less fluctuating habitats of the inner coastal zones; c) invasive alien species were connected with two major plant strategies: annual invasive aliens (quick-to-mature low grasses and herbs) and perennial invasive aliens (taller and often strongly clonal).

AB The field of ecoinformatics is concerned with gaining a greater understanding of complex ecological systems. Many ecoinformatic tools, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), can shed important insights into the complexities of ecological data through pattern recognition and prediction; however, we argue that ecological knowledge has been used in a very limited fashion to shape the manner in which these approaches are applied. The present study provides a simple example of using ecological theory to better direct the use of neural networks to address a fundamental question in aquatic ecology-how are local stream macroinvertebrate communities structured by a hierarchy of environmental factors operating at multiple spatial scales? Using data for 195 sites in the western United States, we developed single-scale, multi-scale and hierarchical multi-scale neural networks relating EPT (Orders: Ephermeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) richness to environmental variables quantified at 3 spatial scales: entire watershed, valley bottom (100s-1000s m), and local stream reach (10s-100s m). Results showed that models based on multiple spatial scales greatly outperformed single-scale analyses (R=0.74 vs. R=0.51) and that a hierarchical ANN, which accounts for the fact that valley- and watershed-scale drivers influence local characteristics of the stream reach, provided greater insight into how environmental factors interact across nested spatial scales than did the non-hierarchical multi-scale model. Our analysis suggests that watershed drivers play a greater role in structuring local macroinvertebrate assemblages via their direct effects on local-scale habitats, whereas they play a much smaller indirect role through their influence on valley-scale characteristics. For the hierarchical model, the strongest predictors of EPT richness included descriptors of climate, land-use and hydrology at the watershed scale, land-use at the valley scale, and substrate characteristics and riparian cover at the reach scale. In summary, our results highlight the importance of incorporating environmental hierarchies to better understand and predict local patterns of macroinvertebrate assemblage structure in stream ecosystems. More generally, our case study serves to emphasize how incorporating prior ecological knowledge into ANN model structure can strengthen the relevance of ecoinformatic techniques for the broader scientific community.

AB Although human-mediated extinctions disproportionately affect higher trophic levels, the ecosystem consequences of declining diversity are best known for plants and herbivores. We combined field surveys and experimental manipulations to examine the consequences of changing predator diversity for trophic cascades in kelp forests. In field surveys we found that predator diversity was negatively correlated with herbivore abundance and positively correlated with kelp abundance. To assess whether this relationship was causal, we manipulated predator richness in kelp mesocosms, and found that decreasing predator richness increased herbivore grazing, leading to a decrease in the biomass of the giant kelp Macrocystis. The presence of different predators caused different herbivores to alter their behaviour by reducing grazing, such that total grazing was lowest at highest predator diversity. Our results suggest that declining predator diversity can have cascading effects on community structure by reducing the abundance of key habitat-providing species.

AB We synthesise the results of the papers in this Special Issue, place them within the context of current trends in floodplain research, and outline promising new avenues that emerge from the contributions. The indication system presented complements existing approaches by focussing on a quantitative indication of environmental parameters. A promising research line that emerges is an extension of the systematic comparison of taxonomic groups with contrasting traits in terms of their performance as quantitative indicators for different environmental parameters. The studies show similarities and dissimilarities in the traits explaining the functional response of plants, molluscs, carabids, and syrphids to site conditions but trait databases and studies on additional taxa are required before broad generalisations can be made. The rigorous study design developed for the RIVA project, of which all contributions in this Special Issue are a part, not only was essential for an improvement of the understanding of species environment relationships and the role biological traits play for it, it also provides a baseline for assessing future change as part of long-term ecological monitoring of floodplains.

AB The aim of this study was to identify shape patterns of the shoulder girdle in relation to different functional and environmental behaviours in turtles. The Procrustes method was used to compare the shoulder girdles (scapula and coracoid) of 88 adult extant turtles. The results indicate that four shape patterns can be distinguished. The shoulder girdles of (1) terrestrial (Testudinidae), (2) highly aquatic freshwater (Trionychidae, Carettochelyidae) and (3) marine turtles (Cheloniidae, Dermochelyidae) correspond to three specialized morphological patterns, whereas the shoulder girdle of (4) semi-aquatic freshwater turtles (Bataguridae, Chelidae, Chelydridae, Emydidae, Kinosternidae, Pelomedusidae, Platysternidae, Podocnemididae) is more generalized. In terrestrial turtles, the long scapular prong and the short coracoid are associated with a domed shell and a mode of locomotion in which walking is predominant. By contrast, highly aquatic freshwater turtles share traits with marine turtles. In both, the short scapular prong and the long coracoid are associated with a flat shell, and swimming locomotion. The enlarged attachment sites of the biceps, coracobrachialis magnus, and supracoracoideus also give these strong swimmers a mechanical advantage during adduction and retraction of the arm. Increasing size leads to allometrical shape changes that emphasize mechanical efficiency both in terrestrial and in aquatic turtles.

AB High growth rates and temporal or spatial opportunism are considered central to the success of filamentous algae, in particular for escaping or minimising the effects of herbivory. However, the role of chemical defences in filamentous algae has received far less attention. We investigated possible chemical feeding deterrence by filamentous red algae that have conspicuous cellular inclusions (Asparagopsis armata, Anotrichium tenue and Balliella amphiglanda) and 2 others without inclusions (Callithamnion korfense and Ulva sp.). The 3 algae with cellular inclusions were consumed at lower rates by a generalist amphipod, Hyale nigra, than the other 2 algae. To determine the potential role of chemical defences for A. armata, we conducted tests against herbivores using algae in which the production of halogenated metabolites was manipulated. This manipulation had no effect on carbon and nitrogen values of the algae, and allowed us to directly test the role of algal secondary metabolites in defence against herbivores without using artificial diets. Bromide (+) algae (with halogenated metabolites) deterred grazing by 2 mesograzers (Hyale nigra and juvenile abalone Haliotis rubra), which consumed up to 4 times more bromide (-) (metabolite-free) algae than bromide (+) algae. Juveniles of the sea hare Aplysia parvula were not deterred by the chemical defences in bromide (+) A. armata. In field assays, artificial diets containing a crude extract of A. armata were also active against herbivores. Although functional form models typically predict that tolerance - not resistance - should be the key defensive strategy for marine algae with simple architecture, this study demonstrates that resistance traits may also be important and more broadly utilised in filamentous species.

AB Bottom trawling causes widespread physical disturbance of sediments in seas and oceans and affects benthic communities by removing target and non-target species and altering habitats. One aspiration of the ecosystem approach to management is to conserve function as well as biodiversity, but trawling impacts on benthic community function need to be understood before they can be managed. Here we present the large scale and long term impact of chronic trawling on the functional composition of benthic invertebrate communities using a comprehensive set of functional traits. The effects of chronic trawling disturbance on the functional composition of faunal benthic invertebrate communities, as sampled with a small beam trawl, were investigated at 6 to 13 sites in each of 4 contrasting regions of the North Sea. Each site was subject to known levels of trawling disturbance. Information on the life history and ecological function traits of the taxa sampled was translated into fuzzy coding and used to analyse the relationship between life history and functional roles within the ecosystem. Multivariate analyses were used to examine changes in the distribution of traits over gradients of trawling intensity. Changes in the functional structure of the community due to the effects of long-term trawling were identified in 3 of the 4 areas sampled. Filter-feeding, attached and larger animals were relatively more abundant in lightly trawled areas, while areas with higher levels of trawling were characterised by a higher relative biomass of mobile animals and infaunal and scavenging invertebrates. Univariate analysis of selected traits confirmed the patterns observed in multivariate analysis. These results demonstrate that chronic bottom trawling can lead to large scale shifts in the functional composition of benthic communities, with likely effects on the functioning of coastal ecosystems.

AB 1. Multiple biological invertebrate traits (e.g. body size, body form, dispersal potential) each described through multiple categories (e.g. small, intermediate or large body size) could serve as indicators of particular types of human impacts on large rivers. The trait composition of natural invertebrate communities is scarcely constrained by taxonomic differences among them, i.e. individual trait categories could be used to discriminate various types of human impacts across large geographic areas, which would require the definition of trait patterns for conditions of relatively low human impact.
   2. Using large databases to link 14 biological traits (described through 66 categories) of invertebrate genera to their occurrence in running water reaches with known environmental conditions, we examined the accuracy of various approaches to predict expected trait variation across least impacted river reaches (LIRRs) of Europe in a stepwise analytical procedure. This procedure included Monte Carlo simulations and ultimately the assignment of test-LIRRs (reaches not used in previous analyses) to the previously defined LIRR conditions.
   3. Distance from the source was an integrative variable capturing some (but not all) landscape features (e.g. altitude) or habitat variables (e.g. reach shear stress). Correspondingly, the relative abundance of many trait categories changed along 13 European running waters, although particularly the intensity of these changes differed among these 13 running waters.
   4. 'Downstream models' (using only distance from the source as predictor) provided the least accurate predictions of expected invertebrate trait patterns when compared with 'landscape models' (using distance from the source in combination with altitude and/or latitude) or 'habitat models' (using reach shear stress, mean annual air temperature and/or pH of the water). Landscape models provided more accurate predictions than habitat models, but the improvement of predictions of expected invertebrate traits patterns obtained using landscape models was negligible in comparison with a simpler 'mean-model' approach, suggesting that defining LIRR conditions through simple descriptions of frequency distributions would be sufficient for the future biomonitoring of large European rivers.
   5. To define these LIRR conditions, we used the average of the relative abundance of each trait category from 68 LIRRs (>= 40 m wide) as expected LIRR values, and computed LIRR frequency distributions that described the deviations of the 68 individual LIRRs from these expected values. Computing such deviations from the expected LIRR values for 57 test-LIRRs (also >= 40 m wide), 57 trait categories correctly assigned > 90% of the test-LIRRs to LIRR conditions if the latter were defined through the entire range of the LIRR frequency distributions. To the 90%-range enveloped by the LIRR frequency distributions, 42 trait categories correctly assigned > 80% and 12 categories > 90% of the test-LIRRs.
   6. Using a framework that required no regionalisation of a large geographic area, no modelling of expected values using environmental information and no standardised invertebrate sampling, the performance of our trait approach to assign test-LIRRs to LIRR conditions encourages future assessments of deviations from these defined LIRR conditions in large European river reaches with different types of human impacts.

AB Wetland restoration designs do not frequently consider functional linkages among habitats in the estuarine landscape, nor do they focus sufficient attention on the role of marsh morphology in promoting the efficient exchange of materials and organisms between the intertidal and subtidal water column. These features should be considered, because many marine organisms may benefit from trophic subsidies from adjacent habitats without ever entering them. Stable isotopes were used to examine trophic linkages between primary producers and marine finfishes to highlight the importance of individual life history traits and to punctuate the argument for promoting habitat connectivity (exchange of materials and organisms) in restoration planning. We demonstrate that the trophic spectrum of an estuarine resident, the Moreno americana (white perch), and two marine transients, Anchoa mitchilli (bay anchovy) and Cynoscion regalis (weakfish), are largely functions of locally available organic matter distributed along a gradient of estuarine resources. In both salt marshes and open waters, there was a transition in whole-body isotopic composition in all three species associated with the estuary-wide gradient in nutrient availability ranging from macrophytes and benthic microalgae in marshes, to phytoplankton (as suspended particulate matter) in the open estuary. As anticipated, phytoplankton contributed more to bay anchovy and weakfish biomass, especially in open waters, than to white perch. Our results also suggest that marine transients benefit from the presence of salt marshes without necessarily occupying them. Thus the estuarine "commissary" serves up different recipes in different regions, and the many estuarine-dependent species apparently take full advantage of these varied sources of primary production at the base of the food web when seeking energy for rapid growth and survival.

AB Scytosiphon lomentaria (Lingb.) Link. (Phaeophyceae) is one of the two dominant seaweeds in a coastal area of northern Chile affected by copper mine wastes, where the concentration of copper in water and algal tissues remains higher than in nonimpacted sites. Copper-loaded plants develop oxidative stress, as demonstrated by the increased levels of reactive oxygen species and lipoperoxides. This stress was associated with 1) an enhanced activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, and dehydroascorbate reductase and 2) an inhibition of the glutathione reductase activity. Furthermore, stressed plants showed a decrease in glutathione and phenolic compounds levels and an increase in total ascorbate. Reciprocal transplants revealed that plants rapidly adjusted their antioxidant system in response to the conditions of the receiving site. In individuals transplanted from the copper-enriched environment to the control site, normal levels of lipoperoxides and antioxidant compounds were restored in 48 h and antioxidant enzymes recovered their basal activities in 96 h. Individuals transplanted from the control site to the copper-enriched area adjusted their antioxidant compounds and antioxidant enzymes within 48 h and 96 h, respectively, and reached the functional status of the local plants. We conclude that S. lomentaria inhabiting the copper-enriched area buffered oxidative stress by a simultaneous involvement of antioxidant enzymes and water-soluble antioxidant compounds. These antioxidant responses were rapid and reversible, suggesting that copper resistance in S. lomentaria is a constitutive trait and that copper enrichment of the area did not result in a locally adapted copper-tolerant ecotype.

AB The factors that control biodiversity have been the focus of numerous recent investigations; these include species interactions, speciation, environmental gradients and heterogeneity, all of these operating differently at each observation scale. We used a null model to examine the influence of two forces shaping the community structure of Dactylogyrus species parasitic on roach (Rutilus rutilus) gills: interspecific competition that might prevent the coexistence of the most similar species and environmental filters that might result in the most similar species coexisting together. The study was carried out on two sets of fish from two different localities in the Morava river basin (Czech Republic) to evaluate the consistency of the results across host populations, and at three different scales of observation to test for the scale dependence of assembly rules. In decreasing order, from largest to smallest, the three spatial scales investigated were: the individual fish, the individual gill arch and individual sections of each gill arch. The similarity between pairs of parasite species was measured using three different criteria: (1) phylogeny, (2) quantitative functional traits consisting of parasite size and morphometric measurements of the attachment organ's sclerotized parts and (3) qualitative attributes of reproductive organs. First, our study reveals a strong conservatism of ecological characters for the nine Dactylogyrus parasite species, in particular regarding the attributes of their copulatory organs. Second, our study did not find any limitation of similarity among coexisting Dactylogyrus species due to interspecific competition, irrespective of the scale and the similarity measures considered. Conversely, our results support the niche filtering hypothesis, preventing the co-occurrence of species too dissimilar from one another. This process is particularly apparent at the scale of the individual fish and for functional traits associated with the hard parts of the parasites' attachment organs. In both localities, the Dactylogyrus species that occur on the same fish individuals tend to have similar values for the haptor dimensions. Our study supports previous studies on monogenean parasite communities indicating a weak influence of competition as a structuring force, but it goes a step further by identifying environmental filtering as a key process shaping these communities.

AB Variation in behavior, morphology and life history traits of larval anurans across predator gradients, and consequences of that variation, have been abundantly studied. Yet the functional link between morphology and burst-swimming speed is largely unknown. We conducted experiments with two divergent species of anurans, Scaphiopus holbrookii and Rana sphenocephala, to examine how behavior and morphology influence predator vulnerability, and whether tadpole shape is related to burst-swimming performance. Scaphiopus holbrookii, a species that typically uses ephemeral pools, was more active, exhibited slower burst speeds, and was more susceptible to predation than R. sphenocephala, a species associated with more permanent aquatic sites. Our analysis of morphology and burst speed defined a shared axis of shape variation associated with burst-swimming speed regardless of species. Tadpoles with a deeper tail fin and muscle and a smaller body produced faster speeds. The nature and breadth of the morphology-speed relationship suggests it may represent a generalized ecomorphological paradigm for larval anurans.

AB Freshwater biodiversity is threatened by several mechanisms, of which the introduction of non-indigenous species and habitat alteration are the two most important. Exotic species act at various levels of organisation of macroinvertebrate communities, and are involved in different processes mediating their impacts on biodiversity, such as habitat modification or negative interactions with autochthonous fauna. The present work gives a list of the 43 French freshwater non-indigenous species, which represent 1.2% of the French freshwater macroinvertebrates. We provide their geographic origins, their distributions among zoological units by comparison with the native fauna and their functional characteristics according to a recent typology based on bio/ecological traits. An exponential trend of the cumulated number of non-indigenous species was evidenced, with a clumping of invaders within crustaceans and molluscs. Donor areas of non-indigenous species are in majority European, and the Ponto-Caspian basin is identified as the principal one. This pattern could be explained by a spread along waterways but its origin lies in a process of recolonisation of defaunated areas following several episodes of glaciation/deglaciation in Western Europe during the last 80,000 years. Finally, from a functional point of view, non-indigenous species exhibit a limited diversity, with two functional groups representing 80% of them.

AB During metamorphosis, most amphibians undergo rapid shifts in their morphology that allow them to move from an aquatic to a more terrestrial existence. Two important challenges associated with this shift in habitat are the necessity to switch from an aquatic to terrestrial mode of locomotion and changes in the thermal environment. In this study, I investigated the consequences of metamorphosis to the burst swimming and running performance of the European newt Triturus cristatus to determine the nature and magnitude of any locomotor trade-offs that occur across life-history stages. In addition, I investigated whether there were any shifts in the thermal dependence of performance between life-history stages of T. cristatus to compensate for changes in their thermal environment during metamorphosis. A trade-off between swimming and running performance was detected across life-history stages, with metamorphosis resulting in a simultaneous decrease in swimming and increase in running performance. Although the terrestrial habitat of postmetamorphic stages of the newt T. cristatus experienced greater daily fluctuations in temperature than the aquatic habitat of the larval stage, no differences in thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance were detected between the larval aquatic and postmetamorphic stages. The absence of variation across life-history stages of T. cristatus may indicate that thermal sensitivity may be a conservative trait across ontogenetic stages in amphibians, but further studies are required to investigate this assertion.

The absence of the ovarian capsule ventral portion, absence of oviduct and funnel-shaped coelomic cavity are features that imply that oocytes are freed in the coelomic cavity before being shed to the aquatic environment through a genital papilla. The only functional testis (left) was cord-like with a maximum diameter of 1-1.5 cm and was connected to the genital papilla through a spermatic duct.

AB The concept of niche overlap appears in studies of the mechanisms of the maintenance of species diversity, in searches for assembly rules, and in estimation of within-community species redundancy. For plant traits measured on a continuous scale, existing indices are inadequate because they split the scale into a number of categories thus losing information. An index is easy to construct if we assume a normal distribution for each trait within a species, but this assumption is rarely true. We extend and apply an index, NOK, which is based on kernel density functions, and can therefore work with distributions of any shape without prior assumptions. For cases where the ecologist wishes to downweight traits that are inter-correlated, we offer a variant that does this: NOKw. From either of these indices, an index of the mean niche overlap in a community can be calculated: NOK,community and NOKw,community. For all these indices, the variance can be calculated and formulae for this are given. To give examples of the new indices in use, we apply them to a coastal fish dataset and a sand-dune plant dataset. The former exhibits considerable non-normality, emphasising the need for kernel-based indices. Accordingly, there was a considerable difference in index values, with those for an index based on a normal distribution being significantly higher than those from an index which, being based on kernel fitting, is not biased by an assumption for the distribution. The NOK values were ecologically consistent for the fish species concerned, varying from 0.02 to 0.53. The sand-dune plant data also showed a wide range of overlap values. Interestingly, the least overlap was between two graminoids, which would have been placed in the same functional group in the coarse classification often used in functional-type/ecosystem-function work.

AB The freshwater crab Sesarma fossarum (Decapoda, Brachyura, Sesarmidae) was only recently described as a new species. As in most other endemic Jamaican crabs that have radiated in limnic and terrestrial environments, its early life history has been largely unknown. In an experimental laboratory study this species was reared through embryonic, larval, and early juvenile development, and ontogenetic changes in biomass (contents of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen) were measured. The duration of egg development varied greatly within a single brood, such that larval hatching occurred through an extended period (12 d). Larval development invariably consisted of two non-feeding (fully lecithotrophic) zoeal stages and a facultatively lecithotrophic megalopa, followed by metamorphosis to the first juvenile crab stage (always feeding). The zoeal phase lasted on average 4-5 d, while the megalopa required 8-10 d. This abbreviated and largely food-independent mode of development is interpreted as a life-history adaptation to conditions of food limitation in the breeding habitat of this species (presumably maternal burrows dug in river banks). This strategy is based on an enhanced maternal energy investment in the production of large, yolk-rich eggs; (ca. 1.4 mm size, 0.6-0.7 mg dry mass). The megalopa shows a highly flexible nutritional strategy where the appearance of a functional feeding system allows for exploitation of external energy sources, while its development remains, in principle, independent of scarcely available food. However, when megalopae were reared without any food, the first juvenile crab stage showed an enhanced mortality and a reduced body size. Decreasing C, H, and C:N values indicate that the fully endotrophic (embryonic and zoeal) phase is principally based on. a utilization of lipid reserves; the same applies to the development of megalopae reared in a continued absence of food. In fed megalopae, increasing N and decreasing C:N values indicate that dietary energy was primarily invested in protein synthesis, required for the construction of new tissues and organs. Similarity in the reproductive, developmental, and bioenergetic traits of S fossarum and other limnic or terrestrial crabs from Jamaica suggest that food limitation during the early larval phase has been one of the principal selection factors driving the evolution of the endemic non-marine clade of sesarmids towards increasing egg size and larval lecithotrophy.

AB Many aquatic systems depend on allochthonous organic matter. Quality of litter differs between plant species. Therefore, the composition of the surrounding vegetation may influence litter decomposition and other processes in aquatic food webs. We recorded the abundance of insect larvae, as well as the diversity of cultivable fungi and bacteria, the metabolic diversity of the microflora, and leaf litter decomposition rates in aquatic outdoor microcosms, using litter from four broad-leaved tree species and a mixture of the four litter types. Diversity of fungi, abundance of bacteria and functional diversity of the microflora and decomposition differed between microcosms with litter from each of the four tree species. For microcosms with the mixture of litter, observed values of all measured variables did not differ from the expectations derived from microcosms with litter from only one tree species. We conclude that specific traits of the component litter species (e. g. C/N ratio) outweigh possible non-additive effects in mixtures. Our results contrast with findings in terrestrial systems where decomposition rates of mixtures are not always predictable from the rates measured for the component species.

AB Many species with complex life histories can respond to risk by adaptively altering the timing of key life history switch points, including hatching. It is generally thought that such hatching plasticity involves a trade-off between embryonic and hatchling predation risk, e.g., hatching early to escape egg predation comes at the cost of increased vulnerability to hatchling predators. However, most empirical work has focused on simply detecting predator- induced hatching responses or on the short-term consequences of hatching plasticity. Short-term studies may not allow sufficient time for hatchlings to exhibit compensatory responses, which may extend to subsequent life stages and could alter the nature of the trade-offs associated with hatching plasticity. In this study, we examine the consequences of predator-induced hatching plasticity through the larval stage to metamorphosis in the East African reed frog, Hyperolius spinigularis. To do this we conducted an experiment in which we manipulated initial larval size and density (mimicking the effects of egg predators) and the presence of aquatic predators. We expected that predator-induced hatchlings (because they are less developed and smaller) would experience higher per capita predation rates and a longer larval period and thus would exhibit lower survival to metamorphosis in the presence of aquatic predators than larger, more developed, later hatched larvae. Surprisingly, we found that predator- induced hatchlings survived better, not worse, than hatchlings from undisturbed clutches. These results motivated us to develop a model parameterized from additional experiments to explore whether a combination of mechanisms, compensatory growth, and density- and size-specific predation, could give rise to this pattern. Predicted survival probabilities from the model with compensatory growth were consistent with those from the field experiment: early hatched larvae grew more rapidly through vulnerable size classes than later hatched larvae, resulting in higher survival at metamorphosis. Thus, in this system, there does not appear to be a trade-off in vulnerability between egg and larval predators. Instead, our results suggest that the cost that balances the survival benefit of hatching early to evade egg predators arises later in the life history, as a result of smaller size at metamorphosis.

AB Over the past decades, the North Sea ecosystem has been subjected to long-term variations of key natural as well as anthropogenic factors. Decadal trends in eutrophication or of the North Atlantic climate system presumably led to changes in extensive ecosystem variables such as algal biomasses or nutrient concentrations. These are investigated in great detail as part of few monitoring programmes such as the long-term time-series at Helgoland Roads (HR) within in the German Bight. In order to study the more relevant changes in ecosystem functioning as a response to external forcings and to assess the endogenous dynamics of the system, a new combination of modeling methods is proposed. The approach is based on a comprehensive marine food-web model, the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM) together with an inverse modeling procedure. After integrating the HR time-series together with other environmental data relevant to the German Bight, long-term trends in the calibrated functional characteristics are unequivocally revealed. Apparently, the ecosystem evolves using a small number of distinct regulation modes, as reflected by a sequential timing of transitions in single ERSEM parameters. Typical transition times are estimated to be about 3-6 years. The most prominent shifts are observed for the maximal growth rates of all phytoplankton groups, several diatom growth parameters and for the specific nitrification rate. While for many sites within the North Sea including HR, significant alterations in nutrient and biomass levels were repeatedly reported in the early 1980s, major internal adaptations detected by the inverse method accumulate during the late 1960s and mid-1990s. Hence, one has to differentiate between the long-term evolution of standing stocks and the evolution of ecophysiological traits. First indications of the subtle influence of North Atlantic climate on the southern North Sea ecosystem are discussed. The study also illuminates several limitations together with potential improvements of marine ecosystem models. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Maternal and physical factors play a significant role in animal life-history variability, which means that large scale climate change has the potential to affect the size and dynamics of animal populations indirectly through maternal investment and directly through conditions that animals are exposed to. However, little is known about the effects of large-scale oceanographic events such as the El-Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) that influence productivity in the Southern Ocean and the abundance, quality and distribution of prey. The possible mechanisms by which physical factors and primary productivity could influence life-history traits, such as survival of apex predators, includes direct influences such as food availability and foraging success and indirect influences such as stored maternal investment and resource transfer during lactation. Here, we quantify the relative contribution of maternal investment and climate conditions at remote foraging sites to survival in the first year of life for southern elephant seals. We present evidence linking climate (ENSO) and variations in a key demographic parameter-first-year survival-and demonstrate that survival was highest during ENSO events and that the ability of mothers to store and acquire resources, which is typically related to ocean productivity, is the most important determinant of survival in the first year. This functional link provides valuable insights that can be used to model the responses of the seal populations to climate change scenarios.

ID MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; TRAITS
AB We used phylogenetically based comparative analyses to test for associations between extinction risk in European freshwater fishes and a variety of life history, ecological, and biogeographical traits. Based on the World Conservation Union classification scheme, a total of 47% of Europe's 287 native species are classified as threatened with extinction. Threatened species are significantly smaller than less-threatened species in the same genera when analyses are restricted to fully freshwater species. This trend is reversed when anadromous genera are included. These comprise many large-bodied species in which fishing has often played a greater role in declines than in other taxa. Threatened species did not differ significantly in their habitats, although they tended to occupy a narrower variety of habitats biased toward streams and rivers. Threatened species occupy much narrower latitudinal ranges than close relatives that are less threatened, and they also have more southerly distributions where pressures on habitats are intense. This study suggests that links between life histories and threat status of freshwater fishes are not as clearcut as for marine species. For fish restricted entirely to freshwater, small-bodied species are most at risk owing to their naturally small ranges, which may put them in a more precarious position when their habitats are impacted by humans.

AB The relationship between species and functional diversity remains poorly understood for nearly all ecosystem types, yet determining this relationship is critically important for developing both a mechanistic understanding of community assembly and appropriate expectations and approaches to protecting and restoring biological communities. Here we use two distinct data sets, one from kelp forests in the Channel Islands, California, and one from a global synthesis of marine reserves, to directly test how variation in species diversity translates into changes in functional diversity. We find strong positive relationships between species and functional diversity, and increased functional diversity of fish assemblages coinciding with recovery of species diversity in marine reserves, independent of the method used for classifying species in functional groups. These results indicate that low levels of redundancy in functional species traits exist across a suite of marine systems, and that fishing tends to remove whole functional groups from coastal marine ecosystems.

AB Human activities have increased N availability dramatically in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Extensive research demonstrates that local plant species diversity generally declines in response to nutrient enrichment, yet the mechanisms for this decline remain unclear. Based on an analysis of >900 species responses from 34 N-fertilization experiments across nine terrestrial ecosystems in North America, we show that both trait-neutral and trait-based mechanisms operate simultaneously to influence diversity loss as production increases. Rare species were often lost because of soil fertilization, randomly with respect to traits. The risk of species loss due to fertilization ranged from >60% for the rarest species to 10% for the most abundant species. Perennials, species with N-fixing symbionts, and those of native origin also experienced increased risk of local extinction after fertilization, regardless of their initial abundance. Whereas abundance was consistently important across all systems, functional mechanisms were often system-dependent. As IN availability continues to increase globally, management that focuses on locally susceptible functional groups and generally susceptible rare species will be essential to maintain biodiversity.

AB 1. Changes in species distributions along rivers have rarely been observed independently of changes in environmental conditions and meaningful comparison between different catchments is made difficult by the limited geographical distribution of species. This study presents a new approach to quantify the effect of the spatial structure of lowland river networks on aquatic plant distribution and to explore the potential underlying processes using species life-history characteristics.
   2. Twenty-five species of aquatic vascular plants recorded in 62 sites across five calcareous river basins were used to investigate (i) the temporal turnover of plant species, (ii) the habitat utilisation of species, (iii) the trade-offs between different plant life-history characteristics and (iv) the relationship between species life-history characteristics and habitat utilisation.
   3. The annual plant turnover within a 3-year period was, although significant, extremely low. It suggests that results from spatial surveys conducted over 3 years should not be undermined by temporal changes.
   4. Spatial connectivity along and between rivers was more important than in-channel physical characteristics in shaping species assemblages. Neither chemical factors (ammonium, phosphate) nor extrinsic biotic competitors (filamentous green algae) significantly influenced plant distribution.
   5. The most common combinations of life-history characteristics were neither related to environmental conditions nor to spatial isolation. Instead, they could reflect natural selection processes associated with larger scales than those considered in this study.
   6. Plant distribution was most strongly related to the dispersal and regeneration abilities of the plants, supporting the hypotheses relating to longitudinal connectivity. The hypothesis that different growth forms would be associated with different in-channel physical features was not verified. As expected, there were no substantial differences in plant life-history characteristics between river basins.

AB We aimed to assess the impact of drier and warmer conditions on flowering traits of two common species of the coastal Mediterranean shrublands, Erica multiflora and Globularia alypum, which flower in autumn and winter. To achieve this goal, we performed a field experiment over two years, using a novel nonintrusive technique to prolong the drought period or to create passive nighttime warming. Drier conditions (17%-29% reduction in annual mean soil moisture) delayed most of the studied flowering phenophases, altered the length of the flowering period, decreased the functional flower production, and extended the flower life span in both species. Warmer conditions delayed and advanced, respectively, the onset of autumn and winter flowering of G. alypum in the first year. Higher temperatures also decreased the number of G. alypum plants with functional autumn flowers by 20%, whereas they increased the number of G. alypum plants with functional winter flowers by 28%. Therefore, our results indicate that drier and warmer conditions might alter the flowering phenology and production of these Mediterranean species. This, in turn, might lead to a change in the species composition and structure of these Mediterranean shrublands in the long term.

AB The main objective of this study was to measure the impact of benthic invertebrate diversity on processes occurring at the water-sediment interface. We analyzed the effects of interactions between three shallow water species (Cerastoderma edule, Corophium volutator, and Nereis diversicolor). The impacts of different species richness treatments were measured on sediment reworking, bacterial characteristics, and biogeochemical processes (bromide fluxes, O-2 uptake, nutrient fluxes, and porewater chemistry) in sediment cores. The results showed that the three species exhibited different bioturbation activities in the experimental system: C. edule acted as a biodiffusor, mixing particles in the top 2 cm of the sediments; C. volutator produced and irrigated U-shaped tubes in the top 2 cm of the sediments; and N. diversicolor produced and irrigated burrow galleries in the whole sediment cores. C. edule had minor effects on biogeochemical processes, whereas the other species, through their irrigation of the burrows, increased the Solute exchange between the water column and the sediment two-fold. These impacts on sediment structure and solute transport increased the O-2 consumption and the release of nutrients from sediments. As N. diversicolor burrowed deeper in the sediment than C. volutator, it irrigated a greater volume of sediments, with great impact on the sediment cores.
   Most treatments with a mixture of species indicated that observed values were often lower than predicted values from the addition of the individual effects of each species, demonstrating a negative interaction among species. This type of negative interaction measured between species on ecosystem processes certainly resulted from an overlap of bioturbation activities among the three species which, lived and foraged in the same habitat (water-sediment interface). All treatments with N. diversicolor (in isolation and in mixture) produced similar effect on sediment reworking, water fluxes, nutrient releases, porewater chemistry, and bacterial characteristics. Whichever species associated with N. diversicolor, the bioturbation activities of the worm hid the effect of the other species. The results suggest that, in the presence of several species that use and modify the same sediment space, impact of invertebrates on ecosystem processes was essentially due to the most efficient bioturbator of the community (N. diversicolor). In consequence, the functional traits (mode of bioturbation, depth of burrowing, feeding behaviour) of an individual species in a community could be more important than species richness for some ecosystem processes.

AB Epizoochory and endozoochory are well-recognized long-distance seed dispersal mechanisms, yet their relative importance has hardly been studied before. Here, epiand endozoochory were compared on donkeys foraging in a species-rich 100 ha coastal dune ecosystem, through in vitro germination of zoochorous material obtained by fur brushing and dung collection. We identified 6675 seedlings of 66 plant species, covering 20% of the species recorded in the study area. Of the 66 species, only 16 occurred in both epiand endozoochory samples, demonstrating the complementarity of both dispersal mechanisms. The species composition in the zoochory samples reflected a strong seasonality, and seedling numbers were partly correlated with species abundance in the study area. The non-zoochorously dispersed species in the study area differed from the zoochorous species in seed size and weight, plant height, life span, dispersal strategy and seedbank persistence. Dispersal-relevant plant traits were used to derive dispersal-functional plant types for all species in the study area. Epizoochory showed to be more specific than endozoochory and was associated with a more narrow range of dispersal-functional plant types.

AB Sessile organisms often exhibit morphological changes in response to permanent exposure to mechanical stimulation (wind or water movements). The adaptive value of these morphological changes (hydrodynamic performance and consequences on fitness) has not been studied extensively, particularly for higher plants submitted to flow stress. The aim was to determine the adaptive value of morphological patterns observed within two higher aquatic plant species, Berula erecta and Mentha aquatica, growing along a natural flow stress gradient. The hydrodynamic ability of each ramet was investigated through quantitative variables (drag coefficient and E-value). Fitness-related traits based on vegetative growth and clonal multiplication were assessed for each individual. For both species, the drag coefficient and the E-value were explained only to a limited extent by the morphological traits used. B. erecta exhibited a reduction in size and low overall plant drag at higher flow velocities, despite high drag values relative to leaf area, due to a low flexibility. The plants maintained their fitness, at least in part, through biomass reallocation: one tall ramet at low velocity, but shorter individuals with many interconnected stolons when flow velocity increased. For M. aquatica, morphological differences along the velocity gradient did not lead to greater hydrodynamic performance. Plant size increased with increasing velocities, suggesting the indirect effects of current favouring growth in high velocities. The fitness-related traits did not demonstrate lower plant fitness for high velocities. Different developmental constraints linked to plant morphology and trade-offs between major plant functions probably lead to different plant responses to flow stress.

AB The dependence of positive species interactions on the traits of individuals has rarely been explored, particularly in marine communities. Therefore, we have little idea about their generality, scales of variability, or reliance on local conditions. Transplant experiments and surveys conducted at 14 sites spanning across similar to 900 km of the central Chilean coast demonstrate that alongshore variation in upwelling, occurring over 10s to 100s of kilometers, explains among-site differences in growth rates of the turf-forming alga Gelidium chilense, which drives predictable landscape patterns in turf height. At upwelling centers, turf algae grew faster and attained taller heights than at warmer downstream locations, where the algal turf remained short because it grew slower and was pruned-back in winter. Replicated, reciprocal transplants of tall and short algal turf, combined with manipulations that controlled predator access to turf, revealed that recruitment of the mussel Perumytilus purpuratus was differentially enhanced by the turf; benefits were strong when the turf was short, but disappeared when the turf was tall. By determining mussel prey supply to higher trophic levels, upwelling-controlled facilitation has important consequences for community regulation. This is the first study to identify upwelling as a physical mechanism generating environmental conditions that (1) control trait-dependent habitat modification and (2) regulate the relative importance of facilitation in marine rocky intertidal communities.

AB The physiological basis for ecological processes is in many cases little understood. The purpose of this work was to link 3 important physiological processes in algae-photosynthesis, carbon uptake and antioxidant defence-to life form. The organisms used were the morphologically similar filamentous green algal species Cladophora glomerata and Ulva procera, which seemingly occupy the same niche when they co-occur in dense belts in the upper littoral zone of the brackish Baltic Sea in summer. Their life strategies are different: the annual C. glomerata usually stays attached throughout summer, while the ephemeral U. procera can appear and disappear from the same site from week to week. The algae were growing in the field under exactly the same conditions (mixed stands) and were, immediately used in experiments at a field station. Fundamental ecophysiological differences were found between the 2 species. (1) Higher photosynthetic activity was detected in U. procera. (2) More shad e-adaptations were found in U. procera, and more sun-adaptations in C. glomerata. (3) C. glomerata uses a proton pump for HCO3- transport, and carbon uptake does not depend on periplasmic carbonic anhydrase. This is an advantage in dense algal belts with longer periods of carbon limitation. (4) C. glomerata invests more in carotenoid protection against oxidative stress, including high carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios and a functional violaxanthin xanthophyll cycle. (5) U. procera was more sensitive to oxidative stress created by UV-B radiation than C. glomerata, which correlates with a more effective intracellular (carotenoid: and enzymatic) defence against oxidative stress in C, glomerata. (6) H2O2 in the seawater medium had a negative effect on photosynthesis in C. glomerata, but not in U. procera. This suggests that a high release of H2O2 by U. procera under oxidative stress may damage C. glomerata, While the ecophysiological traits of C. glomerata seem to be directed toward persistence, those of U. procera seem to be more engaged with large but short-term gains. This is in accordance with their different life strategies.

AB Rapid changes in biodiversity are occurring globally, yet the ecological impacts of diversity loss are poorly understood. Here we use data from marine invertebrate communities to parameterize models that predict how extinctions will. affect sediment bioturbation, a process vital to the persistence of aquatic communities. We show that species extinction is generally expected to reduce bioturbation, but the magnitude of reduction depends on how the functional traits of individual species covary with their risk of extinction. As a result, the particular cause of extinction and the order in which species are lost ultimately govern the ecosystem-level consequences of biodiversity loss.

AB We describe a new behavior of planktonic ciliates. The field-collected tintinnid Eutintinnus inquilinus attached with its lorica to a range of surfaces, including particulate aggregates. Most tintinnids remained attached with the aboral end of their lorica when well fed. On starvation, many tintinnids detached and resumed a free-swimming life. We hypothesize that the adhesive property of the lorica has evolved as an adaptation to attach to suspended aggregates or other seston particles. Attached E. inquilinus have a feeding rate that is 80% higher than free-swimming individuals because of the change in the fluid dynamics of the feeding current for attached E. inquilinus, which leads to steeper velocity gradients and higher flow rates close to the lorica. This mechanism will also operate for swimming suspension feeders attached to smaller particles that significantly increase the hydrodynamic drag. Selection for traits that enhance the velocity gradients in feeding currents of small plankton may be common and may partly shape behavioral patterns and functional morphology. When exposed to the calanoid copepod Acartia clausi, populations of E. inquilinus were less susceptible to predation than another Eutintinnus species of similar morphology but that were entirely free swimming.

AB Physiological, anatomical, and developmental features of the crocodilian heart support the paleontological evidence that the ancestors of living crocodilians were active and endothermic, but the lineage reverted to ectothermy when it invaded the aquatic, ambush predator niche. In endotherms, there is a functional nexus between high metabolic rates, high blood flow rates, and complete separation of high systemic blood pressure from low pulmonary blood pressure in a four-chambered heart. Ectotherms generally lack all of these characteristics, but crocodilians retain a four-chambered heart. However, crocodilians have a neurally controlled, pulmonary bypass shunt that is functional in diving. Shunting occurs outside of the heart and involves the left aortic arch that originates from the right ventricle, the foramen of Panizza between the left and right aortic arches, and the cog-tooth valve at the base of the pulmonary artery. Developmental studies show that all of these uniquely crocodilian features are secondarily derived, indicating a shift from the complete separation of blood flow of endotherms to the controlled shunting of ectotherms. We present other evidence for endothermy in stem archosaurs and suggest that some dinosaurs may have inherited the trait.

AB 1. Comparative studies of distinct, but not ecologically isolated, systems such as lakes and streams may improve our understanding of the importance of ecological linkages in aquatic ecosystems.
   2. In this study we compared the macroinvertebrate benthos of stony habitats in Swedish lakes and streams. Community composition was used to evaluate zoogeographic patterns and functional feeding guilds were used to identify mechanisms potentially affecting such patterns.
   3. Stream communities were generally more diverse and species-rich and had a higher proportion of grazers, shredders and passive-filter feeders than lakes. Lake communities had a higher proportion of predators and collector-gatherers. Of the 10 most common taxa, only Leptophlebia mayflies, clams (Sphaeriidae) and the isopod Asellus aquaticus were recorded in both lakes and streams.
   4. Among-site variance in macroinvertebrate communities accounted for by regional-scale variables was low (6.4% for lakes and 10.1% for streams), compared with that by local-scale variables (21% for lakes and 37.6% for streams). For lakes, the among-site variance in macroinvertebrate communities was best explained by habitat-scale characteristics followed by ecosystem, riparian, catchment, geographic position and ecoregion. For streams, the variance in macroinvertebrate communities was best explained by ecosystem characteristics followed by habitat, catchment, riparian, ecoregion and geographic position.
   5. Conspicuous differences in spatial pattern were revealed between lakes and streams. For lakes, the most unequivocal differences in community composition and function occurred at the transition zone between the mixed forests in the south and the boreal coniferous forests in the north. Surprisingly, streams did not respond as strongly to profound landscape-level differences in climate and vegetation cover.
   6. The spatial differences noted between macroinvertebrate communities of lakes and streams may be because of differences in retention of detrital matter. Our findings imply that detrital inputs are qualitatively similar, but that the retention and processing of coarse particulate organic matter was presumably higher in lake littoral regions than in stream riffle habitats.
   7. Although our findings support the conjecture that species distribution is determined fundamentally by conditions prevailing at the local-scale, regional factors such as land use/type and the role of history were important and seemingly act as strong determinants of large-scale patterns in biodiversity.

AB Empirical studies investigating the role of species diversity in sustaining ecosystem processes have focused primarily on terrestrial plant and soil communities. Eighteen representative studies drawn from post-1999 literature specifically examined how changes in biodiversity affect benthic ecosystem processes. Results from these small-scale, low-diversity manipulative studies indicate that the effects of changes in biodiversity (mostly synonymous with local species richness) are highly variable over space and time and frequently depend on specific biological traits or functional roles of individual species. Future studies of freshwater and marine ecosystems will require the development of new experimental designs at larger spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, to successfully integrate field and laboratory studies, the derivation of realistic models and appropriate experiments will require approaches different from those already used in terrestrial systems.

AB Differences in fish community structure between different estuaries, lagoons and bays can be very large, and generalisations are complicated by the use of a wide variety of sampling methods. In the present study, fish communities of subtidal seagrass beds and sandy seabeds in 13 marine embayments of a single Caribbean island were therefore sampled using a uniform method. The objective of the study was to determine whether the seagrass and sandy seabed habitats of various embayments are characterised by typical fish assemblages which differ in terms of taxa, (species, families), size classes (life stages) and functional groups (ecological species groups, feeding time and diet). This was linked to the hypothesis that differences in fish assemblages between habitats in different embayments are larger at taxonomic levels than at the level of functional groups. A second objective was to determine the most useful discriminating features between the two habitat types. The above hypothesis was rejected, since differences in fish assemblages from different seagrass and sandy seabed sites did not increase from functional to taxonomic level, but from size class to diet/species to family/feeding time to ecological species group. However, the seagrass and sandy seabed habitats could each be characterised by typical fish assemblages which differed in taxonomical and functional group composition, irrespective of differences in environmental and biotic variables between the embayments in which these habitats were situated. The two habitat types could be best characterised on the basis of fish family, ecological species group, feeding time and size distribution. Seagrass beds mainly harboured nocturnally active nursery species (Haemulidae, Lutjanidae, etc.), whose relative abundance was related to vegetation (mainly seagrass) cover. Sandy seabeds mainly harboured diurnally active bay species (Gerreidae, etc.) whose relative abundance was related to cover of bare sand. Similarities in taxonomical and functional traits of fish species predicted whether they occurred more abundantly in seagrass beds or in sandy seabeds. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Harpacticoida reside in a wide range of habitats--from all marine situations to most freshwater habitats, and even moist terrestrial substrata like moss and litter. They exhibit free-living to parasitic life-styles and larval development with plankto- and lecithotrophy. Harpacticoid life cycles as a rule comprise six nauplius larvae and six copepodids, the sixth being the adult. Harpacticoid life history traits known from the field or from cohort analyses include differential fecundity, stage duration and survival, sex ratio, development and life span. Understanding life history traits, i.e. assessing the importance of various biotic and abiotic factors in regulating life cycle patterns, is essential for the interpretation of seasonal variations of population size. Evolutionary stable strategies (EES) of reproductive resource allocation and timing are determined by trade-offs between environmental conditions as well as by intrinsic factors. The latter are the genetic base, depending on the evolutionary history and relatedness of the taxa under consideration which determine their phenotypic plasticity. Most interesting are ontogenetic niche shifts, especially in habitat, food and stage duration, including dormancy phenomena. Harpacticoid life history traits will be discussed in the light of meio- and macrofauna life cycles in general. It seems as if small meiofaunal taxa are not able to proliferate pelagic larvae of sufficient quantity, because larvae need a certain size to become functional. Instead, meiofaunal taxa switch to a trait of direct development and even brood care in some cases. It is hypothesized that the Harpacticoida are the only meiofaunal taxa to develop larval stages because their nauplii share the same habitat as the adults and no risky habitat transition will occur as in the pelagic larvae of the macrofauna.

AB Ranunculus peltatus Schrank is an aquatic macrophyte spreading in northeastern France. As with other Ranunculus species, its growth demonstrates considerable plasticity. A preliminary understanding of its development and precise adaptive strategy is possible through functional ecology. The present study took morphological traits into account in order to analyse R. peltatus' development and morphological plasticity in relation to environmental parameters. During the five-month growing season, field measurements of ten different morphological traits were performed monthly at twelve sampling sites presenting various physical and chemical characteristics. Three overall growth stages occurred between April and August 2000: a stage of elongation of the main stem, a stage of branching and flowering and a stage of decline associated with vegetative dispersion. The sampling sites were defined according to environmental parameters and divided into three groups corresponding to three morphologically different R. peltatus populations. Plants in upstream, nutrient-poor, undisturbed sites were small and achieved little sexual reproduction. Plants in nutrient-rich, undisturbed sites had long shoots and were branched. Plants in weakly shaded, disturbed sites were small but produced many flowers. Correlations between morphological traits and environmental parameters showed significant relationships between chemical parameters and some characteristic vegetative growth traits. Physical environmental parameters were found to be less well correlated with morphological traits than the chemical parameters. The phenology and morphological plasticity of R. peltatus confer competitive advantages that could explain its ability to spread in some circumstances. Finally, the previous classification of R. peltatus as a Grime CSR species is discussed in relation to its plasticity. According to its morphological characteristics, R. peltatus tended indeed to adopt a C-strategy in nutrient-rich undisturbed sites, a S-strategy in nutrient-poor undisturbed sites and a R-strategy in disturbed sites.

AB Thermostability of photosynthesis was studied in four Mediterranean conifer species growing in southern France, namely Cedrus atlantica and Pinus nigra growing usually on mid elevation areas, and Cupressus sempervirens and Pinus halepensis from coastal areas. Chlorophyll a fluorescence was used and lead to two indices assessing the degree of thermostability of the photosynthetic apparatus: the critical temperature at ground fluorescence breakpoint (T-c) and the temperature threshold inducing a 15% decrease in photochemical efficiency (T-15). The two indices were correlated and yielded similar rankings among species, although mean values of T-15 were 6.5 degreesC lower than that of T-c. Values of T-c were in the range 44 to 52 degreesC and clear interspecific differences were detected. C. atlantica consistently displayed higher Tc than the other species (1-1.5 degreesC difference during a seasonal time course). Among the three other species (C. sempervirens, P. nigra and P. halepensis), the differences were smaller and not always significant. T-c also displayed a large intraspecific plasticity, with: (i) a seasonal time-course showing significant increases during summer and lower values during Spring and Autumn; and (h) large responses to ambient temperatures, with 5-6 degreesC increases in response to a gradual rise of temperature from 10 to 35 degreesC. The amplitude of the rise was of the same magnitude in all species. Therefore records of thermostability of photosynthesis, whatever the parameter used (T-c or T-15) need to take into account the large plasticity in this parameter when comparing species or genotypes. The degree of plasticity in response to given changes in micro-environment could be an important functional trait for the tolerance to environmental stresses.

AB Gymnodinium catenatum is one of several dinoflagellates that produce a suite of neurotoxins called the paralytic shellfish toxins (PST), responsible for outbreaks of paralytic shellfish poisoning in temperate and tropical waters. Previous research suggested that the bacteria associated with the surface of the sexual resting stages (cyst) were important to the production of PST by G. catenatum. This study sought to characterise the cultivable bacterial diversity of seven different strains of G. catenatum that produce both high and abnormally low amounts of PST, with the long-term aim of understanding the role the bacterial flora has in bloom development and toxicity of this alga. Sixty-one bacterial isolates were cultured and phylogenetically identified as belonging to the Protcobacteria (70%), Bacteroidetes (26%) or Actinobacteria (3%). The Alphaproteobacteria were the most numerous both in terms of the number of isolates cultured (49%) and were also the most abundant type of bacteria in each G. catenatum culture. Two phenotypic (functional) traits inferred from the phylogenetic data were shown to be a common feature of the bacteria present in each G. catenatum culture: firstly, Alphaproteobacteria capable of aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis, and secondly, Gammaproteobacteria capable of hydrocarbon utilisation and oligotrophic growth. In relation to reports of autonomous production of PST by dinoflagellate-associated bacteria, PST production by bacterial isolates was investigated, but none were shown to produce any PST-like toxins. Overall, this study has identified a number of emergent trends in the bacterial community of G. catenatum which are mirrored in the bacterial flora of other dinoflagellates, and that are likely to be of especial relevance to the population dynamics of natural and harmful algal blooms.

Using a common garden with pure and hybrid cottonwood trees of known genotype, two years of field surveys, and a cafeteria feeding experiment, we link introgression of Fremont genetic markers, condensed tannins (a genetically based plant trait), and foraging by beavers. These data support two major arguments. First, hybridization is an important mechanism for the transmission of ecologically functional traits. Second, links between a genetically based plant trait in a dominant riparian-forest,tree species and the foraging behavior of beavers, an ecosystem engineer, emphasize that genetically based plant traits can directly and indirectly link population, community, and ecosystem processes.

AB 1. The application of functional ecology models to aquatic plants often relies on morphological and life-history traits which may reflect, in part, the phenotypic plasticity displayed by aquatic plants. The present study was designed to evaluate the use of physiological traits, such as nutrition patterns, to describe aquatic plant strategies along a gradient of increasing resource availablity.
   2. Taking phosphorus (P) as an example, nutrition-use efficiencies were evaluated in five species, through the P-content in plant tissues, the variations in P-content according to nutrient availability and the perenniality of P-storage. Plasticity in P-storage was also investigated in Ranunculus peltatus, a morphologically highly plastic species.
   3. In 2001, P-content was analysed in Callitriche hamulata, C. obtusangula, C. platycarpa, Elodea nuttallii and R. peltatus tissue samples. These five species were sampled at nine different sites in streams along an increasing resource gradient in the Northern Vosges Biosphere Reserve (NE France). Variations of P-content in the roots, stems and dissected and floating leaves of R. peltatus were also studied.
   4. Only C. platycarpa and R. peltatus were found to occur in low nutrient availability conditions. Callitriche hamulata, C. obtusangula and E. nuttallii were restricted to mesotrophic and eutrophic sites. The highest nutrient-use efficiency was found for E. nuttallii which was able to adapt its P-storage to varying resource availabilities. Ranunculus peltatus was able to store high concentrations of P, but its P-integration within the vegetative structure was less efficient under eutrophic conditions. Callitriche spp. appeared to have relatively low nutrient-use efficiencies, although C. obtusangula displayed a high P-content. While P was stored preferentially in roots in R. peltatus populations occurring in nutrient-rich sites, there was no particular P-storage organ for populations from nutrient-poor sites.
   5. On the basis of P-usage, R. peltatus and E. nuttallii presented competitor traits, C. hamulata and C. platycarpa displayed stress-tolerant nutrient signatures and for C. obtusangula, ruderal or competitor characteristics dominated. The use of physiological traits, such as nutrition patterns, may provide valuable, complementary information about aquatic plant strategies, independent from the influence of morphological trait plasticity often displayed by these plants.

AB Plant palatability plays an important part in the fitness of species and is therefore regarded as a key functional trait. The aim of this study was to relate the palatability of aquatic macrophytes to their distribution in riverine wetlands differing in their exposure to spate flood disturbances. Thirty-three former channels of the Rhone River Basin (eastern France) were characterized in terms of flood-disturbance level. Nutrient richness was also measured to eliminate its potential confounding effect. The coverage of 40 macrophyte species was recorded in these wetlands, and their palatability was assessed through laboratory feeding trials using a generalist consumer, the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. The consumption rate of L. stagnalis ranged from 3.9 mg (.) g(-1) (.) d(-1) (for Hottonia palustris) to 137.9 mg (.) g(-1) (.) d(-1) (for Sagittaria sagittifolia) and was used as a palatability index. Plant palatability was unrelated to the nutrient richness of sites but was positively correlated with their flood-disturbance level. However, the strength of this correlation decreased as nutrient richness increased. These results suggest that spate floods promote functional diversity in riverine wetlands, allowing the persistence of the most palatable plant species otherwise eliminated by herbivores, especially in nutrient-poor habitats.

AB This study investigated the effects of microhabitat characteristics on soil seed bank structure, regeneration strategies, and plant composition in a Mediterranean coastal sand dune in Israel. Three different microhabitats were selected: (a) open patches between shrubs, (b) shrub understorey, and (c) open, disturbed patches in pedestrian trails. In each microhabitat two types of sampling plots were established: (a) seedling removal and (b) control (seedlings not removed). Emerging seedlings in each microhabitat were identified, counted, and removed every two weeks. In the controls, the vegetation was sampled only once at the peak of the herbaceous growing season. At the end of the growing season in plots where seedlings were removed, the upper soil was collected and sieved before seeds set. Viable non-germinated seeds were identified and counted. An estimation of persistent seed banks was obtained for each plot. Species composition, species richness, species diversity, and aboveground biomass by species were estimated. Germination fractions among species and plant functional groups were measured.
   Microhabitats differed in soil seed bank density, germination characteristics, above-ground biomass production, and species composition. The open patches between shrubs generally had the highest densities of seeds, seedlings, and mature individual herbaceous plants. Important density differences between total seedlings removed and mature vegetation may indicate strong plant mortality in all microhabitats. Annual and perennial grasses, composites, annual crucifers, and annual forbs produced transient seed banks, while legumes, umbelifers, and perennial forbs had persistent seed banks. Disturbance by public trampling in trails led to low seed and plant densities in this microhabitat. No effects of facilitation of shrubs on the annual vegetation were noted in shub understorey. Habitat heterogeneity had a strong impact on vegetation structure and regeneration strategies.

AB Predators can have a large influence on their prey through induced changes in prey phenotype. Such "nonlethal" predator effects have been abundantly demonstrated empirically in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. But the extent to which changes in species traits alter short-term responses such as growth rate or probability of survival is not clear. Here we develop models to examine the nonlethal effects of predators on prey growth. Our analyses illustrate how the nonlethal effects of predators on individual prey growth depend on environmental context; e.g., factors such as focal species density, competitor density, resource dynamics, and the timescale over which the interactions occur. This context dependence arises because of complex interactions of three mechanisms; (1) the direct negative effect of induced reduction in foraging rates, which is opposed by (2) the potential positive effects of reductions in intra- and interspecific competition, and (3) resource responses to reduced foraging. We present new empirical work, and review previous work, on larval-anuran growth that is in general support of model predictions. The framework presented here can serve to facilitate the design and interpretation of experimental results and predict how the nonlethal predator effect on prey growth in natural systems will vary over time and space.

AB The Cryptasterina group of asterinid sea stars in Australasia comprises cryptic species with derived life histories. C. pentagona and C. hystera have planktonic and intragonadal larvae, respectively. C. pentagona has the gonochoric, free-spawning mode of reproduction with a planktonic lecithotrophic brachiolaria larva. C. hystera is hermaphroditic with an intragonadal lecithotrophic brachiolaria, and the juveniles emerge through the gonopore. Both species have large lipid-rich buoyant eggs and well-developed brachiolariae. Early juveniles are sustained by maternal nutrients for several weeks while the digestive tract develops. C. hystera was reared in vitro through metamorphosis. Its brachiolariae exhibited the benthic exploration and settlement behavior typical of planktonic larvae, and they attached to the substratum with their brachiolar complex. These behaviors are unlikely to be used in the intragonadal environment. The presence of a buoyant egg and functional brachiolaria larva would not be expected in an intragonadal brooder and indicate the potential for life-history reversal to a planktonic existence. Life-history traits of species in the Cryptasterina group are compared with those of other asterinids in the genus Patiriella with viviparous development. Modifications of life-history traits and pathways associated with evolution of viviparity in the Asterinidae are assessed, and the presence of convergent adaptations and clade-specific features associated with this unusual mode of parental care are examined.

AB Despite the relative simplicity of their modular growth, marine invertebrates such as arborescent gorgonian octocorals (Octocorallia: Cnidaria) generate complex colonial forms. Colony form in these taxa is a consequence of modular (polyp) replication, and if there is a tight integration among modular and supramodular traits (e.g. polyp aperture, inter-polyp spacing, branch thickness, internode and branch length), then changes at the module level may lead to changes in colony architecture. Alternatively, different groups of traits may evolve semi-independently (or conditionally independent). To examine the patterns of integration among morphological traits in Caribbean octocorals, we compared five morphological traits across 21 species, correcting for the effects of phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. Graphical modelling and phylogenetic independence contrasts among the five morphological characters indicate two groups of integrated traits based on whether they were polyp- or colony-level traits. Although all characters exhibited bivariate associations, multivariate analyses (partial correlation coefficients) showed the strongest integration among the colony-level characters (internode distance and branch length). It is a quantitative demonstration that branching characters within the octocorals studied are independent of characters of the polyps. Despite the universally recognized modularity of octocorals at the level of polyps, branching during colony development may represent an emergent level of integration and modularity.

AB Theoretical and empirical studies in community ecology often simplify their study system by lumping together species on the basis of trait similarities ( e. g., their taxonomy, resource or microhabitat usage) and then assume species sharing similar traits are functionally similar. To date, no study has directly tested whether species more similar with respect to any of these traits are more similar in their functional effects on population or ecosystem processes. In this study, we examined the association between traits and functional effects of six different aquatic predatory vertebrates. We demonstrated that functional similarity across multiple response variables was not correlated with trait similarity, but differences in trait values were associated with significantly different effects on individual response variables. The exact relationship between species traits and functional effect of predators, however, was different for each response variable. Using traits to predict functional similarity among species may be useful when considering individual response variables, but only if it is known which traits have the greatest influence on the response variable of interest. It is doubtful that any one scheme will predict the functional similarity of species across a diverse array of response variables because each response will likely be strongly influenced by different traits.

AB Coastal birch forests in northern Norway are currently being converted to normative spruce plantations. Since such land use changes may cause large alterations in the birch forest ecosystems, indicators suitable for defecting and monitoring impacts need to be pursued. In this study, we used a three-table ordination method (RLQ analysis) to identify species traits in bird assemblages indicating changes in environmental attributes at stand and landscape level. RLQ analysis has the advantage of linking species traits directly to environmental attributes, hence detecting the major ecological impacts of land use change, as well as a set of species traits sensitive to these alterations. Birds and environmental attributes were sampled in six forest types in 12 different landscapes. To assess whether species traits were relatively consistent geographically and temporally, two different geographic regions and years were also included in our study design. We found the species traits investigated here to be promising indicators of land use impacts. In particular, ground nesters, cavity nesters, flycatchers, and long-distance migrants were adversely affected by conditions in elderly spruce plantations. Also, species that forage on trunks and in deciduous foliage, as well as species that eat larvae and flying insects, were. related to forests with a deciduous overstory. Despite the variety of species traits reflecting ecological changes at the stand level, only the species sensitive to the reduction in area of rich birch forests responded to fragmentation effects at the landscape level. These effects of land use changes appeared to be consistent in time (years) and space (geographic regions). We argue that knowledge about trait-environmental linkages is essential when selecting indicators for monitoring land use impacts. To best separate human effects from natural fluctuations, major environmental attributes that vary naturally in time and space should also be monitored in conjunction with the indicator species traits. Finally, trait-environmental linkages, could form the basis of making predictions about changes in biological and functional diversity in response to land use changes. These predictions could subsequently be evaluated in monitoring programs.

AB The mechanisms underlying the social structure of free-ranging fish shoals have received little attention in comparison to functional studies on shoaling. Recently, however, a number of investigations, both in the marine and in the freshwater environment, have begun to address the underlying mechanisms by concentrating on interactions between free-ranging shoals. The rates of shoal encounters can influence the opportunities for individual assortment by phenotype and selection of shoal size; act as a constraint on the observed patterns of shoal structure by restricting individual choice behaviour and were found to be high in several small freshwater species (where intershoal distances were small), but lower in marine species where shoals were more dispersed. The duration of encounters may play a role in that it affects both the time available for assessment (of the encountered shoal) as well as that for exchange of individuals. Scarce published information on the outcome of shoal encounters suggests that the outcome of shoal encounters is influenced by shoal composition but not by shoal size. Individual behaviour may have evolved to maintain shoal size when shoals encounter, but when fish populations are depleted by fishing, this trait can exacerbate range and stock collapse. Furthermore, an understanding of the dynamics of shoal encounters has important consequences for the evolution of reciprocal altruism and the transmission of information through social learning within populations. Finally, information on encounter rates between shoals and the number of individuals that are exchanged on such occasions could be important for making predictions about the spread of disease through fish populations.

AB The early ecophysiological trajectories of angiosperm evolution remain uncertain. This hinders resolution of the possible ecological and physiological catalysts that set the stage for the emergence of our modern flora. One approach for generating hypotheses on the early ecology of angiosperms is to consider the distribution of functional traits among lineages that diverge near the root of the extant angiosperm phylogenetic tree. Using recent phylogenetic results to choose lineages for comparative work, we review and expand on previous studies that examine the ecology and physiology of basal angiosperm lineages. Phylogenetic mapping of functional traits reveals that the basal lineages, Amborella, Austrobaileyales, and some Chloranthaceae, share ecological and physiological traits linked to shady, disturbed, and possibly wet habitats. Traits include low and easily light-saturated photosynthetic rates, absence of leaf palisade cells, guttation resulting from root pressure, as well as small seed sizes. Some Chloranthaceae, such as Ascarina and Hedyosmum, however, recruit seedlings in forest light gaps and other sunny, disturbed habitats. In contrast, the early-diverging water lily clade (Nymphaeales) possesses ecophysiological features linked to aquatic, often sunny habitats, such as absence of a vascular cambium and floating leaves with high photosynthetic rates and palisade mesophyll. On the basis of the phylogenetic distribution of functional traits, we hypothesize that the earliest angiosperms were woody and grew in dimly lit, disturbed forest understory habitats and/or shady stream-side settings. The significance of the hypothesis that angiosperms evolved in shady, disturbed habitats for the origin of their distinctive features, e. g., xylem vessels and carpels, and for patterns of their early diversification is discussed. Finally, we examine how the emerging ecological picture of early angiosperms drawn from living basal lineages can be tested with the fossil record.

AB Environmental-induced phenotypic variation in plants is often considered to be a functional response that maximizes fitness in heterogeneous environments. Lycopersicon chilense, a tomato species endemic to Atacama Desert, shows altitudinal phenotypics variations in their natural environments, which could be due to different soil water availabilities. It is hypothesized that (a) seeds coming from populations of different environments, cultivated in the same environment, will have similar phenotypes, if populations are not genetically differentiated, and that (b) the different populations subjected to two drought levels should vary their phenotypic constitution with respect to the control groups. The responses of twenty phenotypic traits to different irrigation levels were studied in nine wild populations of Lycopersicon chilense. Seeds were collected from populations along an altitudinal gradient (from 20 m to 3,075 m), transferred to a common environment and grown under three soil water conditions: low (80 % FC), moderate (40 % FC) and severe (20 % FC). In spite of the climatic differences in their natural habitat the phenotypic responses of plants growing in the same environment was similar in the nine populations. Significant differences among populations were only observed in three out of twenty traits (fruit fresh weight, fruit volume and number of seeds per fruit). Soil water deficit induced a phenotypic response in twelve characters; among these: root dry weight, cover, number of seeting fruits and number of seeds per fruit showed the highest significance. An interaction between population and drought treatment was found only for fresh weight of fruits, fruit volume and number of seeds per fruit. Our data indicate that the phenotypic response does not differ among populations growing under similar environmental conditions. Probably the phenotypic response of L. chilense in their natural habitats is related to physiological and metabolic adjustment rather than genetic variation.

AB This paper examines modifications of benthic structure and species/traits organization of macroinvertebrate communities affected by various hydro-technical structures in the regulated mountain Trzemesnia stream (southern Poland). The samples of aquatic invertebrates were collected seasonally (6 times) at: (1) one control site with natural substrate and at (2) five sites altered by sills, weirs, and canals during 1999. The stream canals, covered by Cladophora glomerata, were clearly distinguished from the other sites by: highest fauna density (mean of 8.5 10(3) ind. m(-2)), lowest taxa richness (mean number of 4.7 taxa), and lowest diversity (H' = 1.1). The benthic communities consisted mainly of collector-gatherers with the highest contribution in the stream canals (range 87-96%). These results suggest that most types of stream regulations (i.e. stream bed formed by concrete bricks) negatively affect the functional organization of benthic invertebrates (collector-gatherers, predators, and scrapers).

AB Two methods traditionally employed to investigate functional diversity in marine benthic ecosystems are relative taxon composition analysis, which interprets changes in the distribution of taxa in terms of the characteristics they exhibit, and trophic group analysis, which investigates differences in feeding mechanisms between assemblages. An alternative approach, biological traits analysis, considers a range of biological traits expressed by organisms to assess how functioning varies between assemblages. This study compares biological traits analysis to the relative taxon composition and trophic group approaches. Biological trait scores were assigned to a range of epibenthic invertebrate taxa from the southern North Sea and eastern English Channel and differences in the relative proportions of these traits were investigated using multivariate methods. The traits important in differentiating stations were attachment, flexibility, body form, mobility, feeding method and life habit. Such assemblages were spatially heterogeneous and there was no obvious distinction between different geographical sectors. This contrasted with the results of the relative taxon composition approach, which showed broad patterns in assemblage distribution in the eastern English Channel and southern North Sea. The biological traits approach provided information on a larger variety of ecological functions than the other techniques and revealed very different relationships between assemblages. It highlighted a greater diversity of assemblage types and was resistant to large-scale biogeographic variations Therefore, it is potentially more useful than the traditional approaches for assessing ecosystem functioning on both large and small scales in benthic environments.

AB The phrase "body plan" or "bauplan" has been used to mean (1) the characteristic features of a phylum or other taxon of high rank, (2) architectural features of animals (such as symmetry; modular units; types of body walls, body cavities, body openings, and body subdivisions; types of supporting structures; position and structure of organ systems), (3) traits characteristic of an especially invariant stage in a life history (phylotypic stage), or (4) patterns of gene expression that first indicate the development of regions of the body. Multiple meanings of bodyplan within one argument can be misleading, but under all four meanings, body plans of animals have changed after stasis for long periods and after stasis during divergence of other traits. Change in body plans is often associated with an identifiable change in a functional constraint. Examples include decreases in body size and changes in requirements for feeding or locomotion. These observations support the hypothesis that functional constraints contribute to stasis in body plans. There is evidence that ancestral developmental processes constrain directions of evolutionary changes in body plans. There is little evidence that developmental processes prevent changes in body plans, but evidence for developmental constraint is more difficult to obtain than evidence for functional constraint.

AB In humid tropical agroecosysterns, maintenance of soil fertility is critical to sustainability, yet inputs of fossil-fuel fertilizer are beyond the economic means of many farmers. One economically viable alternative is to manage soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics by altering the composition and number of crop species. The objectives of this study were to determine long-term effects of crop-species composition and richness on indices of soil fertility, in comparison with forests, and to evaluate mechanisms of crop-species influence. Study plots were established in the diverse array of agroecosystems in Kerala, India, where agriculture has been documented for >4000 year. With 91 different crops in the region, analyses were simplified by categorizing crops by functional groups, based on life form, nutrient cycling traits, and phenology. Mono-, bi- and polycultures contained 1, 2 and >2 functional groups, respectively. A paired-plot design in which a monoculture or biculture was paired with a polyculture within a farm was used, such that climate, soil, ownership, and management were as similar as possible for a pair. Soil properties (total soil organic carbon (SOC), N, pH, bulk density) and crop structural attributes that had the potential to influence SOC stocks (basal area and frequency) were measured in 100 m(2) plots (n = 70 pairs) within 50 farms. Three plots in nearby forests provided a basis for comparison. Total SOC ranged from 6 to 20 g kg(-1) (in coastal areas and uplands, respectively), compared to 34-60 g kg(-1) in nearby upland forests. Differences in total SOC between mono- and polycultures depended on identity of the functional group in the monoculture: SOC amounts were higher in polycultures if the monoculture in comparison was a palm (P = 0.02) or herbaceous annual (P = 0.001), but not if the monoculture was a deciduous tree. Total SOC was 61% lower in polycultures cultivated for 40-60 years than in nearby forests. Under some conditions, total SOC increased directly with basal area (BA), an index of shading, indicating that BA may be an important design element of agroecosystems. Modeling results indicated that differences in lignin content of crop inputs could influence SOM quantity and quality; hence, crop tissue-chemistry traits may also be important elements of design. These results from ancient, humid tropical agroecosystems suggest that for maintenance of long-term soil fertility, high species richness may not be as important as individual species traits that influence nutrient cycling.

AB Evolutionary innovations that require or provide increased per-capita energy budgets and competitive performance should appear at times and in places where resources are abundant and accessible and where predators and competitors impose intense selection. By contrast, innovations without functional benefits should become established in productive environments under conditions of weak selection from enemies. I confirmed these predictions in comparative studies of two types of innovation in gastropod shells. The labral tooth, a structure facilitating predation, appeared in 45 Cenozoic clades of marine gastropods, with the highest concentrations originating during the early Miocene, late Miocene, and Pliocene, all times and sites of high planktonic productivity, large expanses of warm shallow water, and diverse predator-rich biotas. Left-handed coiling, a condition with no obvious survival benefits, arose 19 times independently in right-handed clades. Most left-handed clades, including eight arising in regions outside the tropics, evolved in productive regions where the larva and/or the adult is shielded from intense predation. The times and places of origin of new traits in clades thus offer insights into the geography of evolutionary opportunity.

AB Rivers and river lakes, i.e., lakes that are part of river systems, provide distinctive geomorphic and hydrologic conditions for riparian plants. This variation between lotic and lentic water bodies results in various environments for establishment and growth of plants, but also presents a range of conditions under which plant propagules are transported and deposited along riverbanks and lakeshores. Propagules may be differentially deposited in specific types of fluvial settings depending on their buoyancy. Among riverbanks and lakeshores, we predicted that lakeshores would capture the highest proportion of long-floating seeds, because short floaters will sink before reaching the shoreline. We also predicted that turbulent reaches would receive the highest proportion of short-floating seeds, because these are the sections where buoyancy is least important. Tranquil reaches of rivers were predicted to be intermediate between turbulent reaches and lakes with respect to their efficiency in capturing of long- and short-floating seeds. We tested whether these differences were mirrored in the floras of the different reach types, using reaches of a range of current velocities in 67 sites along a free-flowing river system in northern Sweden. We also related floristic differences to environmental conditions in each of the three reach types (turbulent sections, tranquil sections, and river lakes).
   The proportions of species with long-floating propagules, herbs, and aquatic species were higher along river lakeshores and tranquil reaches than along turbulent reaches, and the opposite was, true for species with short-floating propagules, dwarf shrubs, graminoids, and terrestrial species. The patterns remained when the largest species groups (herbs and graminoids) were tested for floating ability, i.e., the highest proportions of long-floating herbs and graminoids were found in lakes, and the lowest in turbulent reaches; tranquil reaches were intermediate or similar to lakes. Exposure to waves and currents and peat cover explained most of the variation in proportions of species with different floating abilities. We suggest that reach type is a good indicator for predicting the composition of riparian vegetation, especially the proportionate representation of species with various dispersal traits. These results suggest that there is a functional relationship between dispersal traits, channel characteristics, and plant community composition.

AB Indirect effects are fundamental to the biocomplexity of ecological systems, and provide severe challenges to predicting the impacts of environmental change. Interest in indirect effects has expanded exponentially over the past 20 years. Indirect effects arise when direct interactions mediated by changes in density share a species,'when species change the interaction between individuals of other species, or both. Past work, including many studies of marine food webs, has primarily documented the existence of indirect effects and how particular examples arise. Future challenges include (1) developing methods for the systematic detection of indirect effects, (2) documenting the functions describing different classes of interaction modifications, (3) exploring methods to predict indirect effects, including measurement of interaction strengths among species, (4) integrating time-scale differences into the theory of indirect effects, and (5) linking indirect effects and environmental variability. Ecologists are not alone in dealing with complex systems. Consequently, progress may be facilitated by exploring approaches developed in other scientific disciplines oriented toward complex systems.

AB Biological and procedural factors can influence DNA adduct detection in aquatic organisms. Among them, functional structure and metabolic traits represent major biological determinants for adducts formed by lipophilic pro-mutagenic contaminants. In detecting DNA adducts through the P-32-postlabelling assay, efficiency in DNA purification, digestion, labelling, as well as adduct enrichment and quantification may explain differences between independent studies. Reference DNA adducts have been used to verify some P-32-postlabelling aspects. Data obtained for mussels and fish treated with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and environmentally exposed to genotoxins confirm the above assertions. Although the P-32-postlabelling assay cannot be proposed for routine biomonitoring it appears a reliable and very sensitive index of exposure to genotoxic pollutants in both fish and mollusks.

AB Significant progress has been made toward the molecular dissection of the quantitative inheritance of wood property traits in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and several other forest tree species. QTL mapping experiments have been used to reveal the approximate number of genes controlling traits such as wood specific gravity and microfibril angle and the individual effects of these genes on the total phenotypic variance for the trait. These analyses help to define the scope of the challenge to identify genes controlling complex traits. Verification experiments are needed to be certain of QTLs and to determine the effects of environmental variation and differences among genetic backgrounds. Genetic marker by QTL associations might be used for within family marker-aided breeding, although this application will have limited impact on wood quality improvement in pine. New technologies are being used to identify the genes underlying QTLs. Candidate genes can be identified by a variety of approaches such as functional studies, gene mapping and gene expression profiling. Once candidate genes are identified then it is possible to discover alleles of these genes that have direct effects on the phenotype. This will be accomplished by finding SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with the causative polymorphism. Discovery of such markers will enable marker-aided selection of favorable alleles and can be used for both family and within family breeding. DNA marker technologies will complement traditional breeding approaches to improve wood quality in parallel with growth and yield traits.

AB We examined long-term changes in the macroalgal vegetation at Stora Borno Island in the inner Gullmar Fjord on the Swedish Skagerrak coast. This was made possible by access to a 1941 diving investigation. The same sites were reinvestigated in 1998. Community composition and depth distributions of species were compared and changes were analyzed with focus on functional groups (size, thallus shape, and life-history traits). We discovered a significant decrease in the depth extension of macroalgal species and a dramatic decline of species richness in the lower littoral (below 1.6 m of depth) compared with 57 years earlier. Ordination analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in the community composition between the two study periods. In general, small (<10 cm), thin, filamentous, and aseasonal ephemerals increased in relative abundance, whereas larger (>10 cm), coarsely branched, and perennial algae decreased. Calibrations of individual species to local sediment cover, using canonical correspondence analysis, indicated that part of the change in species composition was related to sediment load. Furthermore, large-scale climate differences (NAO Winter Index) between the study periods indicated a higher impact of Baltic Sea and Kattegat water in the nutrient dynamics of the fjord in the 1998 study. We concluded that the observed long-term changes in the macroalgal community at Stora Borno Island were consistent with an increased nutrient availability.

AB Macroecology is an emerging subdiscipline within ecology that explores effects of large-scale processes on local, regional, and global patterns of species diversity and taxon-independent scaling of structural and functional relationships. Statistical analysis of these patterns yields hypotheses concerning the processes determining population, community, and ecosystem-level patterns, which have been the historical focus of most ecological research, including that done in mangroves. The majority of studies of mangrove forests have aimed to better understand the causes of local (within-forest) ecological patterns (e.g. zonation, tolerance to salinity and hypoxia, litter-fall and production), with little attention to the larger environmental, historical and evolutionary contexts that can influence local processes. I argue that a focus on the larger-scale contexts that constrain local processes (a "macroecology of mangroves") will provide us with new insights into the structure and function of mangrove ecosystems. Further, such analyses can be used to determine if mangroves follow similar general rules that have been identified for upland forested ecosystems. I consider two examples: relationships between local species richness and latitude, longitude and regional diversity; and structural coordination of leaf traits. I present data and analyses of these macroecological patterns in mangrove forests, and illustrate points of agreement and disagreement between these and upland ecosystems. I suggest that ecological theory developed in upland forests can be readily applied to mangrove forests. Such a conclusion should lead to advances in ecological research of mangroves and better predictions of how they will respond to global climate change.

AB We examined variation in leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA) in relation to the distribution of 22 chaparral shrub species on small-scale gradients of aspect and elevation. Potential incident solar radiation (insolation) was estimated from a geographic information system to quantify microclimate affinities of these species across north- and south-facing slopes. At the community level, leaf size and SLA both declined with increasing insolation, based on average trait values for the species found in plots along the gradient. However, leaf size and SLA were not significantly correlated across species, suggesting that these two traits are decoupled and associated with different aspects of performance along this environmental gradient. For individual species, SLA was negatively correlated with species distributions along the insolation gradient, and was significantly lower in evergreen versus deciduous species. Leaf size exhibited a negative but non-significant trend in relation to insolation distribution of individual species. At the community level, variance in leaf size increased with increasing insolation. For individual species, there was a greater range of leaf size on south-facing slopes, while there was an absence of small-leaved species on north-facing slopes. These results demonstrate that analyses of plant functional traits along environmental gradients based on community level averages may obscure important aspects of trait variation and distribution among the constituent species.

AB Rhyacophila larvae are aquatic free living Trichoptera, which are commonly considered as carnivorous predators by stream ecologists. We carried out gut contents analyses of each of the five larval instars of four Rhyacophila species, and we found that all larvae started their development (from the first to the first three instars) with a strictly phytophagous diet (diatoms and filamentous algae). The larvae became strictly carnivorous since instar III, IV or V, depending on the considered species. Both young herbivorous and older carnivorous larvae occurred together in the stream, during 10 and 7 months in the two species R. meridionalis and R. occidentalis respectively. Therefore, the functional role of these 'predators' within macroinvertebrate communities should be interpreted more conservatively. Some implications for common ecological approaches are discussed.

AB Water potential and morpho-anatomical parameters were measured, during the course of I year, on leaves of Quercus ilex trees growing in two coastal stands in Tuscany (Central Italy) with different conditions of water availability: Colognole (CL, mesic site) and Cala Violina (CV, xeric site). Morpho-anatomical measurements included: general leaf features and sclerophylly indices (surface area, thickness, mass per area and density), leaf moisture indices (water content, relative water content, succulence) and histochemical analysis (detection and localization of cutine and tannins in the leaves and starch reserves in the twigs). During the warmest and driest period (August) pre-dawn water potential (psi (pd)) in Holm-oak leaves reached -2.7 MPa at CV and -0.6 MPa at CL. Leaf surface was lower (-34%) and total leaf thickness (+10%), as well as spongy-palisade parenchyma ratio (+20%) were higher at CV. The sclerophylly parameters (leaf mass per area and leaf tissue density) were higher at CV than at CL (+24% leaf mass per area and +19% leaf tissue density). Among the moisture parameters, water content was higher at CL (+8%) and succulence was higher at CV (+13%). No differences in relative water content were observed between the two sites. All the parameters considered were substantially stable during the study period, with the exception of relative water content at CL, that fluctuated within the year. Histochemical analysis revealed a greater thickness of the upper cuticular layer at CV, whereas there were no differences in tannin distribution and content between the two sites. Differences in starch storage were detected in branchlets: it was abundant in CV but very scarce at CL. The strategies of Quercus ilex to cope with water stress were discussed at morpho-structural level. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen fixation by diazotrophic bacteria is a significant source of new nitrogen in salt marsh ecosystems. Recent studies have characterized the physiological and phylogenetic diversity of oxygen-utilizing diazotrophs isolated from the rhizoplanes of spatially separated intertidal macrophyte habitats. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the traits encoded by and the diversity of plasmids occurring in this key ecological functional group. Five-hundred and twenty-one isolates cultivated from the rhizoplanes of Juncus roemarianus, Spartina patens and different growth forms (short-form and tall-form) of Spartina alterniflora were screened for the presence of plasmids. One-hundred and thirty-four diazotrophs carrying plasmids that ranged in size from 2 to > 100 kbp were identified. The majority of the marine bacteria contained one plasmid. Diazotrophs from the short-form S. alterniflora rhizoplane contained significantly fewer plasmids relative to isolates from tall-form S. alterniflora, J. roemarianus and S. patens. Although some plasmids exhibited homology to a nifH gene probe, the majority of the plasmids were classified as cryptic. Two oligonucleotide primers were developed to facilitate genotypic typing of the endogenously isolated marine plasmids by the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)PCR technique. These primers proved to be more effective than 21 commercially available primers tested to generate RAPD-PCR patterns. Analysis of the RAPD-PCR patterns indicated as many as 71 different plasmid genotypes occurring in diazotroph bacterial assemblages within and between the four different salt marsh grass rhizoplane habitats investigated in this study.

AB Dichogamy is one of the most widespread floral mechanisms in flowering plants and is thought to have evolved to reduce interference between pollen import and export within flowers, especially self-pollination. Self-pollination between flowers may also be reduced if dichogamy is synchronous among flowers on an inflorescence. The analysis of dichogamy at both levels requires that the sexual phases of individual flowers be defined functionally in terms of pollen deposition and removal. We conducted morphological and functional analyses to investigate the degree of dichogamy within flowers and the synchronicity of dichogamy between flowers within inflorescences in an emergent. aquatic monocot, flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus). Based on daily observations of the development of marked flowers, data on the schedule of anther dehiscence within flowers, and repeat surveys of floral sex ratios in three populations. individual flowers appear to be strictly protandrous. On average, each flower spends similar to1 d in each of male and female phases with an intervening 1-d neuter phase during which there is no available pollen in anthers and stigmas are not yet exposed to receive pollen. Morphological criteria used to delimit the beginning and end of each of these three sex phases were validated by quantifying the temporal schedule of pollen removal from anthers and pollen deposition on stigmas. Experimental pollinations showed that the morphological changes marking the end of female phase are hastened by pollen deposition. At the umbel level, synchronous development within sequential cohorts of flowers reduced overlap of male and female sexual phases between flowers. On average (+/- 1 SE), 72 +/- 3% of flowers completed their female phase while no other flowers on the same umbel were in male phase. Computer simulations of umbel development showed that this value is significantly higher than expected if the Liming of flower development within umbels was random (30 +/- 1%). Surveys of floral sex ratios in three populations revealed that 87% of umbels were either unisexual male or female at any given time. Pollinators usually visited more than one flower in sequence when foraging on umbels, suggesting that synchronous dichogamy may be an adaptation to avoid geitonogamy. The adaptiveness of both flower- and umbel-level dichogamy is also suggested because both traits are expressed to a lesser extent in obligately clonal, triploid populations, where flowers do not make seeds and hence floral adaptations are not maintained by natural selection.

AB Nectar-feeding vertebrates respond to variation in nectar sugar content by modulating volumetric intake. In some nectar feeding animals, the intake response to sugar concentration can be accurately predicted from simple mathematical models that rely on knowledge of gut morphology, in vitro rates of sugar digestion, and daily energy expenditures. Because most of the floral nectars consumed by vertebrates are dilute, these animals ingest large amounts of water while feeding. The water turnover rates of hummingbirds feeding on dilute nectar are more similar to those of amphibious and aquatic organisms than to those of terrestrial vertebrates. Dilute nectars can pose osmoregulatory challenges for nectarivores. Nectarivorous birds exhibit renal traits that are well suited to dispose of large water loads and that appear inadequate to produce concentrated urine. Nectar-feeding birds prefer concentrated over dilute sugar solutions. However, the concentration difference that they can discriminate is smaller at low than at high concentration. We hypothesize that this pattern is a consequence of the functional form of intake responses that often results in decelerating sugar intakes with increasing sugar concentration. The diminishing returns in floral attractivity that may result from increased nectar concentration may be one of the reasons why the nectars of hummingbird pollinated flowers are dilute in spite of the preference of birds for higher concentrations. The intake responses of nectar-feeding birds capture the integration of a behavioral response with the physiological processes that shape it. Because the behavior of nectar-feeding birds can have consequences for the plants that they visit, the intake response may also have coevolutionary effects.

AB Six functional replication origins (repGA14, repGA33, repGA70, repSD41, repSD164 and repSD172), obtained from endogenously isolated, broad-host-range (BHR) marine plasmids ranging in size from 5 to 60 kb, were used to determine plasmid occurrence in three coastal marine sediment sites (in California, Georgia and South Carolina, USA). The plasmid-specific replicons were isolated from plasmid-bearing marine sediment bacteria belonging to the alpha and gamma subclasses of the Proteobacteria. The plasmid sources of the endogenous replicons were considered to be cryptic due to a lack of identifiable phenotypic traits. The putative Rep proteins from a number of these replicons showed similarity to replicons of two recognized families: RCR group III (repSD164) and the FIA family of theta group A (repSD41, repSD121, repGA33 and repGA14). Plasmids isolated from marine bacteria belonging to the genera Pseudoalteromonas, Shewanella and Vibrio cultivated from geographically different coastal sites exhibited homology to two of the marine plasmid replicons, repSD41 and repGA70, obtained from a Vibrio sp. The repGA33 plasmid origin, obtained from a Shewanella sp. isolated from coastal Georgia, was detected in 7% of the Georgia marine sediment Shewanella sp. isolates. Microbial community DNA extracted from marine sediments was also screened for the presence of the plasmid replication sequences. Community DNA samples amplified by PCR yielded a positive signal for the repSD172 and repGA14 replication sequences. The replication origin of BHR plasmid RK2 (IncP) was also detected in marine Vibrio sp. and microbial community DNA extracted from the three coastal sites. These findings provide molecular evidence that marine sediment bacteria harbour an untapped population of BHR plasmids.

AB Disturbance has profound effects on plant community composition. This paper deals with the influence of grazing on species richness and proportions of life-history attributes of grassland vegetation at six spatial scales (0.001-1000 m(2)) in two provinces of southern Sweden. The study comprised 33 dry grassland sites, including 22 grazed and 11 abandoned localities, and 28 sites of coastal brackish meadows, divided into five management types (From "heavily grazed" to "abandoned since long time").
   In general grazed sites were species-richer than abandoned sites; especially at small plot sizes. However, there was a steeper increase in species number rewards larger plot sizes in the abandoned sites. Heavy grazing in the coastal meadows resulted in a comparatively low number of species, corroborating the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.
   The analysis of life-history traits indicated the importance of taxonomic group, canopy structure, height, regenerative strategy and, in particular, life form. Leaf anatomy and seed dispersal seemed to be less important. The responses to grazing as regards species traits differed somewhat between grassland types. Grazed sites generally had high proportions of legumes, therophytes, species with basal position of leaves and with regeneration by means of a persistent seed bank. Abandonment of grazing favoured monocots, geophytes, species with vegetative regeneration and (partly) leafy canopy structure. Some differences between grazed and abandoned sites were confined to either the smallest or largest plot sizes, indicating different responses of matrix and interstitial species. Various positive associations (attribute syndromes) or negative associations between individual traits were identified. There was, for example, a positive link between the attributes "geophytes" and "ability of vegetative regeneration". The recognition of such links is important to avoid misinterpreting certain attributes as functional adaptations to grazing while they are only positively correlated to other attributes of larger significance.

ID HOVERING INSECT FLIGHT; AERODYNAMICS; PROPULSION; FLUID
AB Both kinematics and morphology are critical determinants of performance in flapping flight. However, the functional consequences of changes in these traits are not get well understood. Traditional aerodynamic studies of planform wing shape have suggested that high-aspect-ratio wings generate more force per area and perform more efficiently than low-aspect-ratio wings, but these analyses may neglect critical components of flapping flight such as unsteady fluid dynamics and wing or fin flexion, In this paper, we use an unsteady potential Row analysis that incorporates wing flexion to test predictions of optimal wing shape under varying degrees of unsteady motion and wing flexion, We focus on forward flapping flight and examine the effects of wing/fin morphology and movements on thrust generation and efficiency. We test the model by comparing our predictions with kinematic data derived from the aquatic Right of the ratfish Hydrolagus colliei, Our analyses show that aspect ratio and the proportion of area in the outer one-fifth of the wing can characterize wing shape in terms of aero- or hydrodynamic performance. By comparing the performance of wings that vary in these two parameters, we find that traditional predictions of optimal wing shape are valid only under limited circumstances (when flapping frequency is low, wings are stiff or wings are tapered at the tips), This indicates a complex relationship between locomotor traits and performance and helps explain the diversity of wing kinematics and morphologies observed in nature.

AB Mass extinctions have played many evolutionary roles, involving differential survivorship or selectivity of taxa and traits, the disruption or preservation of evolutionary trends and ecosystem organization, and the promotion of taxonomic and morphological diversifications-often along unexpected trajectories-after the destruction or marginalization of once-dominant clades. The fossil record suggests that survivorship during mass extinctions is not strictly random, but it often fails to coincide with factors promoting survival during times of low extinction intensity. Although of very serious concern, present-day extinctions have not yet achieved the intensities seen in the Big Five mass extinctions of the geologic past, which each removed greater than or equal to 50% of the subset of relatively abundant marine invertebrate genera. The best comparisons for predictive purposes therefore will involve factors such as differential extinction intensities among regions, clades, and functional groups, rules governing postextinction biotic interchanges and evolutionary dynamics, and analyses of the factors that cause taxa and evolutionary trends to continue unabated, to suffer setbacks but resume along the same trajectory, to survive only to fall into a marginal role or disappear ("dead clade walking"), or to undergo a burst of diversification. These issues need to be addressed in a spatially explicit framework, because the fossil record suggests regional differences in postextinction diversification dynamics and biotic interchanges. Postextinction diversifications lag far behind the initial taxonomic and morphological impoverishment and homogenization; they do not simply reoccupy vacated adaptive peaks, but explore opportunities as opened and constrained by intrinsic biotic factors and the ecological and evolutionary context of the radiation.

AB Revealing the consequences of species extinctions for ecosystem function has been a chief research goal(1-7) and has been accompanied by enthusiastic debate(8-11). Studies carried out predominantly in terrestrial grassland and soil ecosystems have demonstrated that as the number of species in assembled communities increases, so too do certain ecosystem processes, such as productivity, whereas others such as decomposition can remain unaffected(12). Diversity can influence aspects of ecosystem function, but questions remain as to how generic the patterns observed are, and whether they are the product of diversity, as such, or of the functional roles and traits that characterize species in ecological systems. Here we demonstrate variable diversity effects for species representative of marine coastal systems at both global and regional scales. We provide evidence for an increase in complementary resource use as diversity increases and show strong evidence for diversity effects in naturally assembled com-munities at a regional scale. The variability among individual species responses is consistent with a positive but idiosyncratic pattern of ecosystem function with increased diversity.

AB On Tenerife, the occurrence of environmental gradients over short distances provides a unique opportunity to investigate the relationship between vegetation and environmental factors. In the semi-arid coastal region of Tenerife, floristic composition, species richness and vegetation structure of perennial plants have been studied in 67 locations covering the existing precipitation gradient.
   On the island as a whole, variation in species composition could be best explained by mean annual precipitation; at coastal sites, substrate age and soil characteristics also played a significant role. On the other hand, substrate chemistry and the type of eruptive material explained little of the floristic variation. Stand biomass was strongly correlated with mean annual precipitation and was, on the youngest lava flows studied, also affected by substrate age. The native stem succulent species made up the bulk of total biomass along the whole precipitation gradient. Disturbed and undisturbed sites differed significantly in stand biomass and cover. Species richness was correlated with precipitation and substrate age. Distribution of plant functional types was also related to the precipitation gradient. The relative abundance of hemicryptophytes and shrubs with non-hairy leaves increased with increasing precipitation whereas the ratio of shrubs with hairy/non-hairy leaves and succulent plants decreased. Some alien plants were quite frequent at disturbed sites but, on the whole, they contributed little to the species spectrum and to the stand biomass. Undisturbed sites remained almost free of introduced species not considering annuals.

AB Field and laboratory investigations were performed to study the distribution and functional significance of antilysozyme activity (ALA) in algal cultures. According to the results obtained, ALA as a trait is widespread among green and blue-green algae but is expressed to different extents. Experiments on the algae-zooplankters model showed that ALA is a factor facilitating the survival of algae in freshwater communities by promoting the establishment of their trophic and symbiotic relationships with other aquatic organisms. Analyzing the intrapopulation structure of algal cultures associated with zooplankters, it was shown that changes in the ALA of algal clones have adaptive significance, providing for a greater stability of algal populations in biocenoses.

AB It is widely assumed that adaptations to an aquatic lifestyle are so profound as to produce only obvious differences between pinnipeds and the remaining, largely terrestrial carnivore species ("fissipeds"). Thus, comparative studies of the order Carnivora routinely examine these groups independently. This approach is invalid for two reasons. First, fissipeds are a paraphyletic assemblage, which raises the general issue of when it is appropriate to ignore monophyly as a criterion for inclusion in comparative studies. Second, the claim that most functional characters (beyond a few undoubled characteristic features) are different in pinnipeds and fissipeds has never been quantitatively examined, nor with phylogenetic comparative methods. We test for possible differences between these two groups in relation to 20 morphological, life-history, physiological, and ecological variables. Comparisons employed the method of independent contra!:ts based on a complete and dated species-level phylogeny of the extant Carnivora. Pinnipeds differ from fissipeds only through evolutionary grade shifts in a limited number of life-history traits: litter weight (vs. gestation length), birth weight, and age of eyes opening (both vs. size). Otherwise, pinnipeds display the same rate of evolution as phylogenetically equivalent fissiped taxa for all variables. Overall functional differences between pinnipeds and fissipeds appear to have been overstated and may be no greater than those among major fissiped groups. Recognition of this fact should lead to a more complete understanding of carnivore biology as a whole through more unified comparative tests. Comparative studies that do not include monophyletic groups for phyiogenetically based comparative tests should be reconsidered.

AB Studies of biodiversity and ecosystem function require to consider the identification level that accurately describes the functional diversity of communities, in terms of their biological traits, at different spatial scales. Therefore, we combined three published data sets of stream macroinvertebrate abundances collected at three spatial scales with a database of functional species traits (e.g. life history, morphology, physiology, and behaviour). We investigated the abundance of taxa and their traits at five levels of taxonomic (from species to class) and three levels of spatial resolution (from local habitat to catchment). We used multivariate analyses and correlations to evaluate the accuracy of community descriptions through the stability of such descriptions, the degree of similarity of site ordinations, and the overall community structure expressed at each taxonomic level. The accuracy of community descriptions based on the abundance of taxa depended on the spatial scale considered. The accurate description of the abundance of taxa required identifications to genera and/or families on the local habitat scale, while species identifications were needed on the catchment scale. In contrast, the accurate description of the abundance of biological traits was achieved by identifications to species, genera, or families on all three spatial scales. Thus, species identifications may not be necessary for future studies on the functional diversity of the stream benthos at different spatial scales.

AB The aim of this paper was to investigate the potential use of biological and ecological traits of macroinvertebrates as indicator systems of quality conditions in freshwater ecosystems. To provide a framework for the trait analysis, a data base was developed; it stored biological information about 472 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa. Twenty-two variables describing biological and ecological traits were resolved into a number of simple attributes. A fuzzy coding procedure was used to describe the link between taxa and variables. Three strategies, using simple descriptive statistics or multivariate ordination techniques, were examined in their abilities to demonstrate some of the characteristics of the environment and to bring out clear information on the rate of changes in habitats. We used the Loire River, France, as a specific example. Like faunal analyses, trait analyses showed that a major change occurred in the community in the upper reaches of the river, but transition zones that were not detected with faunal data alone, were discriminated. They corresponded to differences in combinations of biological and ecological traits of communities and were linked to tributary influences (e.g. the Allier-Loire confluence) or anthropogenic disturbances: dams (Grangent, Villerest) or urban zones (Le Puy, Tours). We concluded that the species trait approach had the potential to evaluate the actual state of ecosystems, to discriminate among different types of human impact, and to develop monitoring tools considering the functional diversity of communities.

AB The main objective of this study was to quantify the relationship between taxonomic and functional parameters of macroinvertebrate assemblages and reach/landscape attributes of agricultural catchment. We aimed to analyse the relation between landscape patchiness and land-water ecotone structure, and their influence on benthic fauna composition, biomass and functional organization. A variety of catchment characteristics: land use patterns, surface geology (e.g. type of soils), elevation, hydrology database were incorporated into a geographical information system (GIS) to evaluate anthropogenic impact on landscape properties. The scenarios of potential transfer of nitrogen load along the gradient of the river valley were elaborated. The assessment of nutrient export focused on identifying the most effective nutrient barriers across spatial scales. The analysis of landscape and reach units demonstrated significant, negative correlations between the rate of nutrient transfer to surface/groundwaters and (i) the length of riparian ecotones, (ii) river width, and (iii) the areas of wetland and forested patches in the catchment. The trophic base (primary producers; CPOM; FPOM) in the stream channel was analysed as a factor modifying the structural and functional organization of macrobenthos. Canopy cover, and the consequent amount of solar input reaching the stream bed, significantly influenced food-related variables: leaf input and algal biomass. The factor that significantly affected food availability, retention and transport of benthic particulate organic matter (BPOM) and amount of chlorophyll a was stream discharge. Higher discharge contributed to low retention of BPOM. To obtain more information about environmental variability (56 variables) and macroinvertebrate functional organization, the entire data matrix was analysed using Principal Component Analysis. A significant correlation was shown in the case of shredder abundance (i) in the low-order station S1, (ii) high canopy cover complexity, and (iii) retention of benthic organic matter. Filtering collectors were significantly associated with the presence of suspended organic matter. Other faunal assemblages, highly related to stream hydraulics factors, were alternative gathering collectors/scrapers, much retained at fourth-order station S3. Stream discharge, depth and chlorophyll a significantly affected the presence of these organisms. This indicated the crucial role of habitat heterogeneity, which was attributable to local conditions (detrital inputs, hydraulics, morphological characteristics), and significantly influenced the trophic structure of biocommunities. In the regulated section of the river (S2) without overhanging vegetation, the abundance of scrapers was significantly correlated with open canopy. Domestic and agricultural impact, evidenced by high nutrient concentrations, significantly reduced species richness (stations S4/S4a). Macroinvertebrate communities were used to detect environmental stress in the river system. Assessment of water quality with biological indices directly revealed human-induced alterations (e.g. land use, lack of riparian vegetation, channelization).

AB Macroalgal blooms are a growing environmental problem in eutrophic coastal ecosystems world wide. These blooms are dominated typically by only one out of several co-occurring opportunistic species, which are all favored by increased nutrient loads. We asked whether pronounced dominance of filamentous Pilayella littoralis Kjellm. (Phaeophyceae) over foliose Enteromorpha intestinalis L. (Chlorophyceae) in the Baltic Sea can be explained by interspecific physiological differences. In laboratory experiments, we analyzed uptake kinetics of nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate and the time dependency of uptake rates for both species. We further examined growth rates and nutrient assimilation in relation to single and combined enrichment with nitrate and phosphate, and three different nitrogen sources. Overall, we did not detect distinct differences in uptake, growth, and assimilation rates between P. littoralis and E. intestinalis. Minor differences and the related advantages for single species are discussed. Highest maximal uptake rates were found for ammonium, followed by nitrate and phosphate. Strong time dependency of uptake occurred, with the highest rates during the first 15 to 30 min. Nitrate enrichment had far more of an effect on growth than phosphate. Enrichment with urea, ammonium, and nitrate significantly increased growth rates without interspecific differences. A larger surface area to volume (SA/V) ratio in Pilayella compared with Enteromorpha did not translate into greater physiological capacity. We conclude that species dominance patterns in macroalgal blooms are not always a direct result of different ecophysiological traits among species. Ecological traits such as susceptibility to herbivory are important factors in determining species distribution in the field.

AB The objective of this work was to study the drainage basin of a small crater lake whose short tributary runs through pastureland and ponds. The catchment was separated into four morphological units and core sampling was carried out to analyze pedological horizons. Five stations were surveyed along the stream. The water quality was investigated seasonally through both physical and chemical variables (oxygen, pH, temperature, phosphorus, nitrate) and with the French normalised biological index. The analysis of macroinvertebrates was made with regard to the spatial heterogeneity of the streambed and the community structure, then categorized by habitat preferences and functional feeding groups. The land at the top of the catchment area, consisting of hydromorphic soils, was used for cattle breeding. This generated the increase in suspended sediment and nutrients concentration in the water. However, the decrease in nutrients from up to downstream, and the evolution of the benthic communities, indicated an improvement in water quality. The high degree of self-purification in the catchment area may result from the combined action of ungrazed hydromorphic soils, ponds and natural purification of the stream. Moreover, the geomorphological characteristics of the catchment influence physical and chemical variables, as well as the biological traits of the macroinvertebrates. As a consequence, the indices of taxa diversity, weighted according to substrates types, seemed to be the most accurate descriptors of the environmental changes. Thus, the resilience of the aquatic ecosystem may be influenced by the degree of complexity of the watershed geomorphology.

AB More than 1600 Valves of Late Cretaceous and early Paleocene Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain gryphaeid oysters (Exogyrinae and Pycnodonteinae) were examined for breakage-induced shell repair and morphologic variability to evaluate the hypothesis of escalation. The Exogyrinae show disproportionately higher average repair frequency (0.41) relative to the ecologically and functionally similar unornamented pycnodonts (0.19). An increase in repair frequency (independent evidence of the action of a selective agent, e.g., predation) through the stratigraphic interval supports escalation. Variation in repair frequencies may reflect differences in oyster morphology and in the strength and diversity of shell crushers across an onshore-offshore gradient. Escalation of antipredatory adaptation characterized the evolutionary response of gryphaeid oysters to their durophagous predators. Adaptation generally occurred by the enhancement of existing traits in both oyster Lineages. Characters that confer a selective advantage against predators are not all expressed or improved concurrently in both oyster lineages. Morphologic adaptations to minimize shell breakage include the development of expansive, broad commissural shelves, thickened valves, and surface ornamentation (Exogprinae). Surface ornament in the Exogyrinae gradually increased with time. For some characters, such as thickness, conflicting functional demands (e.g., valve stabilization) may have limited adaptation to predators.

AB Understanding the functional linkages between the pelagic and demersal stages of marine organisms is a central goal in ecology. To better understand events that occurred during the larval period as well as their initial influence on juvenile traits, we examined individual level variation in early Life-history traits (larval and early juvenile otolith growth rates, size-at-age, and larval duration) of 3 seasonal cohorts of the common coral reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum (Bloch) (Labridae). Juveniles were collected at regular intervals (every second day) for 2 wk following their first appearance on the nearshore reefs of Barbados, West Indies. Otolith analysis indicated that each cohort exhibited a broad range of larval traits. Individuals with shorter larval durations had faster otolith growth and settled at relatively smaller sizes (based on otolith length and standard length) than larvae with longer larval durations, which exhibited slower otolith growth rates. Despite the range in larval durations for T. bifasciatum, otolith growth records revealed no evidence for delay of metamorphosis. Instead, the range in larval durations is likely to be the result of-a variable pelagic environment influencing growth rates. Because metamorphosis in this species is an energetically costly non-feeding (3 to 5 d) period, we propose that successful metamorphosis requires a minimum energy reserve. Slower growers may need to remain in the plankton longer (consequently attaining larger sizes) to obtain this minimum condition. Variability in early life-history traits also occurred among the seasonal cohorts. Despite differences in patterns of larval otolith growth, mean larval duration was similar for the 2 fall cohorts (57 and 55 d), but much shorter for the spring cohort (42 d). Such inter-cohort variability in early life-history traits suggests a variable pelagic environment. In contrast to the larval period, juvenile growth rates were much less variable within and among cohorts, reflecting a more constant physical and biological environment on the reef.

AB A series of models was developed using functionally-derived variables (mainly based on morphological attributes of freshwater macrophytes) to predict the trophic status of river and associated channel systems. The models were compared with an existing species-assemblage based procedure for predicting British river trophic conditions (the Macrophyte Trophic Ranking scheme, MTR). We compared sites in cooler temperate conditions (in Scotland) and warmer, sub-tropical conditions (in Egypt). In total, we made measurements of 13 traits from > 600 individual plant specimens of 33 species growing at 42 sites (divided into independent input and test site datasets). N status (as annual mean concentration in water of total oxidised nitrogen, TON) was only very poorly predicted by this approach. However, P (as annual mean concentration in water of soluble reactive phosphate, SRP) was better predicted: both by a model based on MTR (r = -0.585, p < 0.001), and by models using functional attributes of the macrophyte vegetation. River Trophic Status Indicator (RTSI) models based on ranked plant functional group relationship to river water P concentrations (RTSIFG), or field-measured trait sets of the plants (RTSITR) could also individually explain up to about 34% of the variation in P, both for the total dataset and for subsets from Egypt or Scotland alone or for high v. low-flow sites. Combining both types of RTSI measure produced the most powerful predictive model (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), explaining just over half the variability in P.

AB The assessment of properties and processes of running waters is a major issue in aquatic environmental management. Because system analysis and prediction with deterministic and stochastic models is often limited by the complexity and dynamic nature of these ecosystems, supplementary or alternative methods have to be developed. We tested the suitability of various types of artificial neural networks for system analysis and impact assessment in different fields: (1) temporal dynamics of water quality based on weather, urban storm-water run-off and waste-water effluents; (2) bioindication of chemical and hydromorphological properties using benthic macroinvertebrates; and (3) long-term population dynamics of aquatic insects. Specific pre-processing methods and neural models were developed to assess relations among complex variables with high levels of significance. For example, the diurnal variation of oxygen concentration (modelled from precipitation and oxygen of the preceding day; R-2 = 0.79), population dynamics of emerging aquatic insects (modelled from discharge, water temperature and abundance of the parental generation; R-2 = 0.93), and water quality and habitat characteristics as indicated by selected sensitive benthic organisms (e.g. R-2 = 0.83 for pH and R-2 = 0.82 for diversity of substrate, using five out of 248 species). Our results demonstrate that neural networks and modelling techniques can conveniently be applied to the above mentioned fields because of their specific features compared with classical methods. Particularly, they can be used to reduce the complexity of data sets by identifying important (functional) inter-relationships and key variables. Thus, complex systems can be reasonably simplified in clear models with low measuring and computing effort. This allows new insights about functional relationships of ecosystems with the potential to improve the assessment of complex impact factors and ecological predictions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Although functional classifications have been successfully used in terrestrial and marine ecosystems to generate ecological hypotheses, compare local and regional environments, and supplement studies of biodiversity, they rarely have been applied to aquatic ecosystems, especially interstitial ones. We present two complementary classifications of interstitial invertebrates, and demonstrate their utility as a supplement for conventional measurements of biodiversity, as "common currency" for regional and global comparisons, as a tool for generating hypotheses, and as indictors of ecological variation in space and time. The first classification uses three species traits: diet, locomotion, and body size. Although mode of reproduction and extent of parental care were originally explored, these traits were less useful for prediction and explanation. The second classification reflects the degree of affinity for different subsurface habitats. Invertebrates can be classified as stygoxenes, stygophiles and stygobites. Changes in conditions in subsurface habitats (e.g. through groundwater extraction, sedimentation) can alter the proportions of these categories, providing a useful biological indicator of subsurface dynamics. Presently, use of these functional classifications is limited by a lack of autecological data for many interstitial species. However, as our knowledge increases and these data are obtained, there is great potential for large-scale ecological hypothesis-testing, prediction of the effects of human and natural disturbances, and global comparisons of interstitial assemblages and biodiversity.

AB There is some evidence that traits of fresh leaves that provide structural or chemical protection ('defence') remain operational in the leaf litter and control interspecific Variation in decomposition rate in or on the soil. We tested experimentally whether the negative relationship between foliar defence and litter decomposition rate is fundamental, i.e. whether it is seen consistently across higher plant species and life forms, and whether it is repeated in the floras of geographically and climatically distinct areas separated by an ocean. We employed the published results of two outdoor litter bag experiments, in which we simultaneously compared the relative mass losses ('decomposibility') of leaf litters of a wide range of plant species. One experiment was in Cordoba, Argentina, and included 48 Argentine species typical of the dry, subtropical landscapes along a steep altitudinal gradient. The other was in Sheffield, UK, and hosted 72 British species typical of the temperate-Atlantic landscape there. We linked the two experiments through a similar experiment in Sheffield that hosted litters of subsets of both the Argentine and British species. We also tested fresh leaves of all species from the same areas for tensile strength ('toughness') and relative palatability to generalist herbivorous snails in multi-species 'cafeteria' experiments. Both in Argentina and in Great Britain there were highly significant correlations between leaf palatability (r = 0.61; 0.73) or leaf tensile strength (r = -0.60; -0.60) and litter mass loss across all species. These relationships could be explained by variation both between and within broad life-form groups. Specific leaf area (area:dry mass) of fresh leaves was consistently correlated only with litter mass loss within British life form groups. We illustrated the possible ecosystem consequences of these relationships by comparing functional traits of British species differing in leaf habit. In comparison with deciduous species, evergreens generally had innately slow growth, which corresponded to their longer-lived leaves of lower specific leaf area, higher tensile strength and lower palatability to generalist invertebrate herbivores. Correspondingly, evergreens produced more resistant leaf litter. Thus, slow-growing evergreens might maintain their position in infertile ecosystems through leaf traits that help them to conserve their nutrients efficiently and to keep nutrient mineralization low, thereby not allowing potentially fast-growing deciduous species to outcompete them.

AB A new species of tetraphyllidean eucestode inhabiting Urobatis tumbesensis from inshore waters of southeastern Ecuador shares 3 synapomorphies with Rhinebothroides spp.: apical bothridial suckers poorly differentiated from the marginal loculi, internal seminal vesicles, and insertion of the vas deferens dorsally closer to the poral than the aporal end of the cirrus sac. The new species differs from Rhinebothroides spp. by lacking medial bothridial septa and loculi and having symmetrical ovarian arms, and possesses an apparent autapomorphic trait by having the vas deferens tapering to a narrow tube before entering the cirrus sac, extending posteriorly to the posterior end of the cirrus sac where it expands into an external seminal vesicle running ventral to the cirrus sac anteriorly to anterior to the vagina. In Rhinebothroides spp. the vas deferens is expanded into an external seminal vesicle near the insertion into the cirrus sac As the sister group of Rhinebothroides, we propose a new genus to accommodate the new species. Phylogenetic evaluation of phyllobothriids recently assigned to Anthocephalum shows that they represent a paraphyletic assemblage of species of varying degrees of relatedness to Rhinebothroides spp. and the new species. Uncovering the relationships of the new species and the various species assigned to Anthocephalum permitted reevaluation of character transformations used in previous phylogenetic analysis of Rhinebothroides. Transformation series for 3 characters, previously based on functional outgroup comparisons, changed and a new character, length of cirrus sac, was added. The new phylogenetic analysis differs from the previous hypothesis only in placing R. scorzai as the sister species of R. circularisi + R. venezuelae + R. moralarai rather than of R. freitasi + R. glandularis + R. mclennanae. The occurrence of the sister species of Rhinebothroides in a Pacific Ocean stingray adds additional support to the hypothesis of Pacific origins of South American freshwater stingrays.

AB 1. Traditionally the assessment of river water quality has been based solely on the measurement of physical, chemical and some biological characteristics. While these measurements may be efficient for regulating effluent discharges and protecting humans, they are not very useful for large-scale management of catchments or for assessing whether river ecosystems are being protected.
   2. Measurements of aquatic biota, to identify structural or functional integrity of ecosystems, have recently gained acceptance for river assessment. Empirical evidence from studies of river ecosystems under stress suggests that a small group of biological ecosystem-level indicators can assess river condition. However, physical and chemical features of the environment affect these indicators, the structure and function of which may be changed by human activities.
   3. The term 'river health', applied to the assessment of river condition, is often seen as being analogous with human health, giving many a sense of understanding. Unfortunately, the meaning of 'river health' remains obscure. It is not clear what aspects of river health sets of ecosystem-level indicators actually identify, nor how physical, chemical and biological characteristics may be integrated into measures rather than just observations of cause and effect.
   4. Increased examination of relationships between environmental variables that affect aquatic biota, such as habitat structure, flow regime, energy sources, water quality and biotic interactions and biological condition, are required in the study of river health.

AB Following metamorphosis, juveniles of marine benthic invertebrates continue to develop traits that allow them to function and survive in their (new) non-pelagic environment. The sensitivity of juvenile development to environmental conditions or larval quality, such as nutritional condition, are not well understood. This study presents descriptions of trait development that allow species identification of newly metamorphosed juvenile sea urchins Strongylocentrotus franciscanus and S. purpuratus. Following metamorphosis, these two species were distinguishable for at least 3 weeks by different patterns of coronal and aboral pedicellariae. Temperature studies, conducted at three environmentally relevant levels (8, 11, and 14 degrees C) show that developmental rates varied, but the order in which structures formed and became functional in the first 2 weeks after metamorphosis were not affected by temperature. Juvenile feeding begins 9 days after metamorphosis at 14 degrees C and after other traits have developed. Based on suites of traits, we identified juvenile stages and quantified effects of temperature on rate of development (stage day(-1)) with nonparametric regression and with a temperature coefficient, Q(10). Additional laboratory studies on S. purpuratus show that larval food ration strongly affects the rate of juvenile trait development prior to and after the onset of feeding by juveniles. Comparisons of size of juvenile rudiments and size at metamorphosis between larvae reared in the laboratory at two food levels and wild-caught larvae and juveniles from coastal Oregon (USA) indicate those from the held were well fed and developed at rapid rates. The above information was used to develop a procedure for aging field caught juveniles ( less than or equal to 2 weeks after metamorphosis), provided their thermal history is known. This procedure can be adapted for other invertebrates that acquire traits in an orderly fashion and can be used, in-addition to sampling-intensive surveys, to investigate recruitment dynamics in benthic populations.

AB In our continued investigation of the adaptive interplay between feeding ecology and digestive physiology, we measured postfeeding responses of juvenile Chelydra serpentina, adult Sternotherus odoratus, and subadult Trachemys scripta, three aquatic turtle species that feed at frequent intervals and consume a catholic diet of plants and animals. In this study, we measured O-2 consumption rates from fasting and digesting individuals and compared intestinal nutrient uptake rates and organ masses of turtles fasted for one month with turtles sacrificed one day after the ingestion of a meal equivalent to 5-11% of body mass. O-2 consumption during digestion peaked at rates 3.4, 2.1, and 2.7 times fasting values, respectively, for C.serpentina, S. odoratus, and T. scripta-factors much smaller than those documented previously for reptile species that normally consume large meals at long intervals. None of the turtle species experienced significant postfeeding changes in intestinal uptake of amino acids or D-glucose. Ratios of amino acid uptake rates to D-glucose uptake rates were much greater than 1.0 for each species, either fasted or fed, a finding characteristic of other carnivores as well. Total intestinal capacity to transport the amino acids L-leucine and L-proline and the sugar D-glucose did not change with feeding for any of the turtle species. None of the species experienced significant differences in intestinal mass or enterocyte morphology between fasted and fed individuals. Chelydra serpentina and T. scripta experienced no significant postfeeding changes in organ masses, and the only changes for S. odoratus were 59% and 42% increases in stomach wet and dry masses, respectively, upon feeding. Thus,juvenile C. serpentina, adult S. odoratus, and subadult T. scripta maintain the functional and morphological integrity of their guts during fasting and exhibit only modest metabolic responses to feeding. We hypothesize that these are adaptive traits characteristic of species that frequently consume and digest small meals.

AB The foredune vegetation in the Gulf of Cadiz (SW Spain, S Portugal) was studied by means of morphological characters and functional traits of plants. The 55 vascular species recorded in the area were classified into three functional types: Type I consists mainly of winter annuals of moderate size with soft leaves, showing no presumed adaptations to the dune environment. Plants of Type Il are mostly perennials with a below-ground spreading root network and leaves with presumed adaptations to coastal environmental stress. Type III includes plants mostly capable of being dispersed by sea-water and of withstanding sand burial.
   In relatively unstable soil, Type II and Type III plants were found to be more abundant, their relative proportion depending on the dominance of accretion/erosion processes. Increasing cover of Type I plants was associated with relatively more stable soils. The ratios in occurrences of the three types can be used as an indicator of foredune dynamics.

AB This study used germination methods to examine the density, species composition and functional composition of propagule banks in a series of riverine wetland aquatic habitats subject to varying degrees of hydrological and management-related disturbance. Under permanent inundation (the conditions prevailing at most sites during the growing season) propagule germination and species richness was low, with floodplain perennials and helophytes particularly affected. Densities of floodplain annuals were largely maintained through continued germination of a few flooding tolerant species. On damp mud (conditions associated with hydrological instability) total seedling number and species richness increased significantly, but species richness of germinating hydrophytes declined. Mean seedling density at 0-0.1m depth was 15450 +/- 4400 m(-2), reaching a maximum(162 050 m(-2)) in temporary backwaters. Annual (e.g., Lindernia dubia, Cyperus fuscus) and facultative ruderal species (e.g., Lythrum salicaria and Alisma plantago-aquatica) predominated. Vertical zonation of the propagule bank was weakly developed. The numbers of individuals and species germinating varied significantly between sites. The seasonal, most intensely. disturbed sites (temporary backwaters) supported a numerically large, species rich propagule bank based on floodplain annuals, while the permanent, less disturbed sites (ditches and an oxbow pond) had a small, species-poor propagule bank composed of hydrophytes and helophytes supplemented by allochthonous seed inputs. Sites intermediate on the gradient had a propagule bank dominated by facultative amphibious, ruderal hydrophytes. The composition of the seed bank and the established vegetation was most similar at the heavily disturbed sites where the seed bank was maintained by vigorously fruiting annuals and supplemented by inputs from temporary habitats upstream. At permanent sites much of the propagule bank composition could be accounted for by inputs of floodborne seed from the immediately adjacent floodplain. The established vegetation at such sites appeared to be maintained mainly by vegetative propagation with recruitment from the propagule bank likely only after severe disturbance. The potential contribution of functionally diverse propagule banks to sucessional processes within fluvially dynamic floodplain aquatic habitats is emphasised.

AB The naturally occurring genetic heterogeneity of autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing populations belonging to the beta subclass of the Proteobacteria was studied by using a newly developed PCR-based assay targeting a partial stretch of the gene which encodes the active-site polypeptide of ammonia monooxygenase (amoA). The PCR yielded a specific 491-bp fragment with all of the nitrifiers tested, but not with the homologous stretch of the particulate methane monooxygenase, a key enzyme of the methane oxidizing bacteria. The assay also specifically detected amoA in DNA extracted from various aquatic and terrestrial environments. The resulting PCR products retrieved from rice roots, activated sludge, a freshwater sample, and an enrichment culture were used for the generation of amoA gene libraries. No false positives were detected in a set of 47 randomly selected clone sequences that were analyzed further. The majority of the environmental sequences retrieved from rice roots and activated sludge grouped within the phylogenetic radiation defined by cultured strains of the genera Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira. The comparative analysis identified members of both of these genera in activated sludge; however, only Nitrosospira-like sequences with very similar amino acid patterns were found on rice roots. Further differentiation of these molecular isolates was clearly possible on the nucleic acid level due to the accumulation of synonymous mutations, suggesting that several closely related but distinct Nitrosospira-like populations are the main colonizers of the rhizosphere of rice. Each of the amoA gene libraries obtained from the freshwater sample and the enrichment culture was dominated by a novel lineage that shared a branch with the Nitrosospira cluster but could not be assigned to any of the known pure cultures. Our data suggest that amoA represents a very powerful molecular tool for analyzing indigenous ammonia-oxidizing communities due to (i) its specificity, (ii) its fine-scale resolution of closely related populations, and (iii) the fact that a functional trait rather than a phylogenetic trait is detected.

AB A hypothesis is tested about the functioning of plant secondary metabolite diversity taking into account the role of concentration of mixtures or single compounds: a high diversity secondary metabolite mixture in high concentration provides a more effective protection against herbivores than single compounds or low diversity mixtures in both low and high concentrations. Additionally the role of two unusual secondary metabolites for a weevil when they are incorporated in its diet is explored. Number of eggs laid and diet consumption are measured in the granary weevil Sitophilus granarius exposed to cereal and non-cereal secondary metabolites incorporated in artificial diets to test the hypothesis. Artificial diets had one, two, four or six compounds. The mixtures or single compounds were offered simultaneously to the weevils in concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 5mgg(-1) in a multiple choice experiment. Low oviposition in high concentration six compounds mixture supported the hypothesis. However, low oviposition in a low concentration mixture of four compounds suggests that a moderate diversity may be equally functional in low and high concentrations. Diet consumption by the weevil was not affected by concentration but an increasing number of compounds in the diet reduced it slightly but significantly. The unusual secondary metabolites for the weevil were less or equally effective reducing oviposition and consumption as usual compounds did. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This investigation examines the role of trait-mediated indirect interactions in a simple aquatic food web. We conducted the experiments in cattle watering tanks in order to establish whether competitive and predator-prey interactions between two species are affected by other species in the system; i.e., are pairwise interaction strengths affected by the background species assemblage? We examined the survival and growth response of small bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and small green frog (Rana clamitans) tadpoles in the presence and absence of a competitor (large bullfrogs), the lethal presence of the larval odonate predator Tramea lacerata, and the nonlethal (caged) presence of the larval odonate predators Anax junius and Anax longipes. We demonstrate that large bullfrog competitors and caged Anax affect traits (foraging activity level) of small bullfrog and small green frog tadpoles and that these changes in traits, in turn, affect interactions of the small tadpole species with each other and with the other species. In particular, the following four trait-mediated indirect interactions were evident: (1) Presence of large bullfrog competitors increased the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs and small bullfrogs. (2) Presence of nonlethal Anax reduced the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs. (3) Presence of nonlethal Anax increased the competitive advantage of bullfrogs over green frogs. (4) Presence of nonlethal Anax facilitated midge invasion of the experimental units. The proposed mechanisms (changes in small tadpole activity) involved in these trait-mediated indirect interactions were supported by observational data on tadpole activity and resource levels in the experimental units, and in laboratory experiments examining tadpole activity responses to predators. The occurrence of strong trait-mediated indirect interactions in this simple food web underscores the potential importance of such interactions in animal communities.

AB A heuristic framework for understanding and predicting the distribution and categorical abundance of species in stream communities is presented. The framework requires that species be described in terms of their functional relationships to habitat selective forces or their surrogates, which constitute ''filters'' occurring at hierarchical landscape scales (ranging from microhabitats to watersheds or basins). Large-scale filters are viewed as causative or mechanistic agents that constrain expression of local selective forces or biotic potential at lower scales. To join a local community, species in a regional pool must possess appropriate functional attributes (species traits) to ''pass'' through the nested filters. Biotic interactions are also a potential filter on local community composition, and they are invoked at the lower hierarchical levels, after species have passed through the physicochemical habitat filters. Potential landscape filters and their associated selective properties are identified, as are prospective species traits (for invertebrates and fish) that correspond with filters. A categorical niche model is used to illustrate how relative abundances of species in local communities might be predicted from habitat data collected at different scales.
   The framework emphasizes a biologically based approach to understanding and predicting species distribution and abundance and local community composition by explicitly considering environmental constraints imposed at different scales. As such, it can complement non-mechanistic, correlative approaches to community prediction that often lack generality. Operationalizing the framework will require additional research to specify more clearly 1) the degree to which habitat features at different scales are linked functionally or statistically, 2) what species traits ate possessed by strongly interactive species (e.g., keystones) and which habitat filters most strongly constrain the distribution of these species, and 3) the functional significance of a range of species traits and the extent to which these traits are correlated and hence respond in concert to the presence or modification, of a particular filter. Multi-scale, mechanistic understanding of species-environment relations will likely contribute to better predictions about large scale problems, such as the establishment and spread of exotic species or alterations in community composition with changing land use or climate.

AB The impact of colonization by Sargassum muticum (Phaeophyta: Fucales) on the resident macroalgal assemblage in tidepools was investigated in northern Spain. Sargassum muticum was allowed to colonize and spread in some tidepools, and was periodically removed in others. Changes in the abundance of macrophytes were recorded at three sites over two years. The colonization by S. muticum and the subsequent changes induced on the native assemblage was extremely variable among sites. Where the invader colonized profusely, it induced changes in the macroalgal composition of tidepools. The leathery group of macrophytes was significantly affected and changes were also observed in the foliose group. It was suggested that S. muticum may take advantage of their perennial and opportunistic traits in the interaction with groups of algae with different survival strategies. However, the spatial patchiness of the colonization may mitigate the impact of the invasion at local and regional scales.

AB Observations are presented on mouthpart functional morphology, and on feeding, grooming and defaecatory behaviour of eight species of corophioid Amphipoda, viz. Corophium bonnellii, Lembos websteri, Aora gracilis, A. spinicornis, Gammaropsis nitida, Ericthonius punctatus, Jassa falcata and J. marmorata. These data are considered in relation to tube structure and amphipod posture in relation to the tube. All these species occupy double-ended cylindrical tubes made from 'amphipod silk' secreted by the third and fourth peraeopods, incorporating sediment and other debris to varying degrees. Uniquely among this set of species, however, E. punctatus has a tube that is architecturally distinct. It tapers along its length and has a distinctive oblique main entrance at its widest end. This end is used preferentially. The other species studied use either opening with equal facility. Such a feature is adaptive in facilitating deployment of the antennae and shielding the head of E. punctatus.
   Two groupings of species are proposed: group A which feed inside their tube using pleopod-induced through-tube currents, and group B which feed outside or at the entrance to their tube using external water currents. Group A includes C. bonnellii, L. websteri and the Aora spp. Group B includes E. punctatus and the Jassa spp. Gammaropsis nitida exhibits traits from both groups, adding weight to its perceived status as a genus representative of the stem corophioid. The ischyrocerid habit of externalizing food-gathering may be regarded as the first step along an evolutionary line leading to the rod-building podocerid types and ultimately towards the caprellids. All species examined show a degree of flexibility in their feeding habits which helps to explain the success of this taxon, which has radiated into a great diversify of aquatic biotopes.

AB In pursuit of developing an oil-degrading microbial consortium, we used the principle of ''plasmid assisted molecular breeding'' (PAMB) in a continuous culture system, Three marine bacteria, Pseudomonas putida, Brevibacterium epidermidis, and Pseudomonas diminuta with distinct colony traits, growth rates, and crude oil-degrading abilities (75, 74, and 60% respectively at 1% v/v concentration) were examined for changes in densities of different populations as an index of their functional role in a continuous culture system. The changes observed in the ratio from 4:2:1 through the experimental period are discussed. Pseudomonas putida increased in number in the first 15 days and declined thereafter with a concomitant 10-fold increase in P. diminuta population as observed on day 24. This reversal in trend of the least dominant strain evolving as the most predominant one is highlighted, together with the total oil degradation and emulsifying activity in continuous culture.

AB Bioluminescence is a property that is common in marine bacteria and almost totally absent in terrestrial bacteria, the only known example being the entomopathogenic bacteria in the group Photorhabdus luminescens. Bioluminescence is also one of several traits that are modulated when secondary variants appear in P. luminescens; that is, the secondary variants are in general very dim, or dark. We present here some preliminary studies of the regulation of light emission in P. luminescens in the hope that they may elucidate some of the mechanistic details involved in the conversion between primary and secondary variants. Bioluminescence is a late function in P. luminescens, increasing dramatically after the culture reaches an optical density of 2.0 or more. Addition of rifampicin (RIF), an inhibitor of mRNA synthesis, results in early development of the luminous system; this enhancement is seen approximately two generations after RIF addition. Secondary form variants of strain Hm emit only about 1% as much Light as the primary forms, and this low level of luminescence can be restored to the high level of the primary form by the addition of RIF, indicating that the lux genes are completely functional, and consistent with the hypothesis that the defect that leads to decreased luminescence in the secondary form is at least partially at the post-transcriptional level of regulation. The effect of RIF is specific for light emission, reversing none of the other properties associated with the primary/secondary conversion. In addition, a mutant called hyper was isolated as a hyperpigmented, hyperluminous strain, These two properties are apparently controlled together, as revertants to a wild type level of pigmentation also show a wild type (primary) level of luminescence. These data suggest that a variety of control points and mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of factors considered to be part of the primary/secondary form conversion.

AB Somatic embryogenesis is a phylogenetically ancient trait that allows sessile plants to grow in a modular fashion and to respond plastically to different environmental cues. It facilitates damage repair and permits clonal growth, the capacity to produce potentially independent but genetically identical offspring. Clonal growth is observed to originate from both the shoot or the root part of the plant body and it has been assigned various ecological functions such as reproduction, exploitation and persistence. These functions are rooted in two basic morphological characteristics of clonal growth: the longevity and the length of the connection between clonal parts. Clonality, although an ancient trait, shows a polyphyletic distribution among plant taxa with a strong representation especially among monocots. Phylogenetically controlled comparisons show that clonality is more common among species that occur in cold or nutrient-poor habitats and under poor light conditions. The frequent occurrence of clonals among aquatic species is confounded by the fact that many aquatics are monocots. This however does not necessarily preclude a functional ecological explanation. It is further shown that longevity and length of connection covary negatively, yielding two distinct clonal growth strategies (fragmenting versus compact, persistent clones) with a preference for the more common habitat trait combinations: nutrient-rich, shaded and/or wet versus nutrient-poor, open and/or dry, respectively.

AB The functional significance of herbivore-induced plant traits known to directly or indirectly influence herbivore performance remains largely untested under field conditions due to the difficulty of uncoupling the response to herbivory from the act of herbivory. The signals that activate many of the induced responses in plants are endogenously produced in response to wounding, unlike many of the predator-induced responses found in aquatic invertebrates (which are activated by exogenous cues derived from predators). Jasmonates, endogenously-produced damage signals, activate diverse wound-induced responses in plants including induced nicotine production in Nicotiana sylvestris. The results presented here are from two experiments which illustrate the use of jasmonates to uncouple induced nicotine production in Nicotiana attenuata (Torrey ex. Watson) from wounding. The exogenous addition of methyl jasmonate (MJ) in small quantities (11 mu g for a 1.4 g dry mass plant) to roots of hydroponically-grown plants induces de novo nicotine synthesis and increases whole-plant nicotine concentrations just as wounding does. The MJ-induced changes were proportional to the quantity of MJ given. Moreover, the effects of MJ were additive to the effects of damage. Applications of MJ to shoots were less effective. Root treatments also worked with plants growing in a field plot. The application of MJ represents a promising tool for examining the functional significance of induced nicotine responses in plants growing in their native environments.

AB When animals compete for copulations, large body size often implies high mating success. Small males may, however, compensate for their competitive disadvantage by special adaptive traits. This is the case in marine iguanas, iguanid reptiles of the Galapagos archipelago. In marine iguanas, females copulate only once per season. During copulations, males needed 2.8-3.1 min to initiate ejaculation. Large territorial males copulated long enough (more than 3.1 min) to achieve ejaculations in 95% of copulations, even when disturbed. Small males were separated from females by rival males in 29% of copulations before the start of ejaculation. Small males nevertheless fertilized females using prepared viable ejaculate, which was kept in readiness in hemipenis pouches and transferred into the female cloaca at intromission. This tactic increased the mating success of small males by 41%. This tactic demonstrates the adaptive significance of a trait which is functionally equivalent to non-ejaculatory 'masturbation', and appears to be unique for vertebrates. However, similar phenomena have occasionally been observed, but mostly lacked functional explanation. An 'ejaculation-in-advance' could occur in many taxa in which there is size-dominance hierarchy and sexual interference, but this remains to be determined.

AB Nearly all aspects of the life histories of individual marine-invertebrate species are characterized by ranges of;sizes, seasonal variation, and functional flexibility and phenotypic plasticity in response to varying environmental conditions; that is, they are highly polytypic. Four major areas of polytypy are considered: (1) breeding seasons and cycles vary greatly in time and duration with latitude and from year to year; (2) egg and larval sizes, while showing both genetic and stochastic variability in all species, are often also flexible responses to adult and larval nutrition; (3) modes of development are variable within a number of single species, often reflecting egg-size differences between populations, or even as a result of hatching age of siblings from a single egg mass; and (4) duration of the pelagic larval phase, both before and after the onset of metamorphic competence. Planktotrophic larvae show plastic responses to phytoplankton abundance in their morphologies, and most larvae are flexible in their age at metamorphosis because this complex process requires a more-or-less specialized substratum to induce it for most invertebrate species. New data are presented that provide additional examples of broad flexibility of sibling lecithotrophic larvae to hatch and settle at greatly differing ages. Larvae of the patelloidean gastropod Lottia pelta settled from 8 to 28 days after fertilization, and those of the fissurelloidean Diodora aspera hatched over a three week period from 7 to 30 days post-fertilization; larval settlement had a similarly broad range. Even the planktotrophic-lecithotrophic dichotomy breaks down as increasing numbers of species are found to produce larvae that can metamorphose without feeding (i.e. lecithotrophy), or feed and greatly extend their larval durations (planktotrophy) in the absence of suitable settlement substrata. Invertebrate groups with rigidly canalized life histories are noted to be components of the fouling community, and it is conjectured that an evolutionary history on floating substrata canalized their life histories toward high inbreeding tolerance, often selfing, and brief pelagic larval durations. We note that most life-history theory has considered extremes and major modes in invertebrate development, and suffers from lack of-attention to the abundance of polytypic life-history traits as evolutionary survival mechanisms at the species level. We conclude that response flexibility and plasticity increase both survivorship and fecundity of individuals, while life-history variability increases the likelihood of recruitment across populations and persistence over geological time. More data are needed on the ranges of scalar characters and flexible responses in marine-invertebrate life histories to rigorously evaluate their contributions to evolutionary success.

AB Modem immunology can now trace its molecules, cells, organs and functions that fight infectious diseases to prototypic ancestors in both the aquatic and terrestrial environments. It is not clear which environment exerted the greatest evolutionary pressure during the development of immunologic characteristics. Clearly immune responsiveness began as recognition even at the unicellular level when eukaryotes appeared. Multicellularity brought with it the simultaneous differentiation and specialization of multiple functions including immune competence. For comparative immunologists to adhere to the dogmatic deuterostome/protostome classification of complex metazoans may prove to be inadequate since this taxonomic scheme concerns embryologic origins of the mouth and anus, Other theories that relate to homology/analogy, convergence/divergence may help us to explain what are (for now) common, functional immune traits among both animal groups. Origins deciphered by amino acid and nucleotide sequences will resolve the dilemma of immunologic characteristics common to deuterostomes and protostomes. Precise characterizations and analyses of the resulting homologies and comparisons will yield fruitful information. First, we may then deduce common origins as has been revealed, for example, in functional molecules and cells such as actin/myosin that govern motility. Second, in contrast, we may arrive at what are clear analogies. With respect to origins of immunity there seems to be a preponderance of characteristics associated with tunicates [those of lymphocyte-like cells; IL-1; (IL-2 like) molecules, putative members of the Ig superfamily (Thy-1; Lyt); lectins] that may prove to be homologous once stringent requirements of sequence analyses are fully described. The self/non-self view should be rescued from ad nauseam preoccupation with examining yet more species with respect to (for example) phagocytosis, graft rejection or agglutinin synthesis. Instead, we should direct our research at the membrane level of hemocytes.

AB Adaptation to the thermal environment depends upon heritable, intraspecific variability in the thermal dependence of organismal function. We tested for variability in the thermal dependence of crawling speed population growth rate, and mating compatibility among four strains of the ciliate Euplotes vannus (LL1, Elba, Por7, and Sard6). In addition, we tested for differences in thermal acclimation of crawling speed among the four strains after more than 2 wk of chronic exposure to constant temperatures. The thermal dependence of crawling speed and population growth rate differed significantly among the four strains as determined by ANOVA. Strains also differed significantly in locomotory acclimation to chronic, constant temperature treatments, as indicated by a significant interaction among the effects of strain, acclimation temperature, and test (experimental) temperature. One strain (LL1) showed evidence of positive thermal compensation, whereas other strains showed mixed or no acclimatory responses. The frequency of conjugation between strains of E. vannus was also temperature-dependent. This finding in particular has important implications for Euplotes systematics; genetic exchange may occur between some strains that were previously thought to be reproductively isolated. Differences in functional traits among these clonal strains represent genotypic variability that may broaden the range of thermal environments available to E. vannus and may, in conjunction with differential mating, accelerate the evolutionary response to selection. Such variability may be particularly advantageous for E. vannus, an organism common to shallow marine environments(e.g., tidal pools) that undergo substantial daily and seasonal changes in temperature.

AB 1. To test predictions of the river habitat templet and the patch dynamics concept, trends in species traits and species richness of aquatic beetles were related to the spatial - temporal variability of eighteen habitat types in the alluvial floodplain of the French Upper Rhone River. One hundred and twenty species of beetles were used in this analysis.
   2. The basic information was obtained either from the literature (for most of the species traits) or from observations made at approximately 500 sampling sites in the Bregnier-Cordon and Jons sections over the past 19 years (for habitat utilization). This information was structured by a fuzzy coding technique and examined by ordination analyses.
   3. Analyses of the relationships among nineteen species traits revealed a clear distinction according to traits such as body form (for adults), functional feeding type and food (adults and larvae), attachment to the substrate and dissemination potential (adults and larvae), and patterns of aquatic and/or terrestrial life of adults and larvae. Species traits such as number of descendants per reproductive cycle, and number of reproductive cycles per year or per individual showed less contrast, because these traits are rather homogeneous in aquatic beetles.
   4. Analyses of the habitat utilization by the aquatic beetles revealed a vertical gradient that separates interstitial from superficial habitats, and a transverse gradient for the superficial habitats, which extends from the main channel towards permanent oxbow lakes and temporary waters.
   5. The significant relationship betweeen species traits and habitat utilization demonstrates that most beetle species use a particular set of habitat types with a particular set of species trait modalities.
   6. Species traits of aquatic beetles are homogeneous but evidently very successful and are adapted to many potential conditions of spatial-temporal variability. Because of this homogeneity, observations on aquatic beetles do not support trends of traits in the framework of spatial-temporal variability predicted from the river habitat templet.
   7. The observed species richness of aquatic beetles is low in habitat types with a low spatial-temporal variability, increases as spatial variability increases, and tends to be highest at intermediate temporal variability. This pattern matches predictions of the patch dynamics concept.

AB Several studies have reported positive correlations between the degree of enzyme heterozygosity and fitness-related traits. Notable among these are the correlations between heterozygosity and growth rate in marine bivalves. Whether the correlation is the result of intrinsic functional differences between enzyme variants at the electrophoretic loci scored or arises from non-random genotypic associations between these loci and others segregating for deleterious recessive genes (the associative overdominance hypothesis) is a matter of continuing debate. A prediction of the associative overdominance hypothesis, not shared by explanations that treat the enzyme loci as causative agents of the correlation, is that the correlation is not specific to the type of genetic marker used. We have tested this prediction by scoring heterozygosity at single locus nuclear restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in a cohort of juvenile scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) in which growth rate was known to be positively correlated with an individual's degree of allozyme heterozygosity. A total of 222 individuals were scored for their genotypes at seven allozyme loci, two nonspecific protein loci of unknown function and eight nuclear RFLPs detected by anonymous cDNA probes. In contrast to the enzyme loci, no correlation was observed between growth rate and the degree of heterozygosity at the DNA markers. Furthermore, there was no relationship between the magnitude of heterozygote deficiency at a locus and its effect on the correlation. The differences observed between the effects of allozyme and RFLP heterozygosity on growth rate provide evidence against the associative overdominance hypothesis, but a strong case against this explanation must await corroboration from similar studies in different species.

AB Four definable feeding behaviors used during the metamorphic life history of tiger salamanders are terrestrial prey capture and transport (as adults) and aquatic prey capture and transport (as larvae). Previous studies have focused primarily on the first three of these behaviors and thus aquatic prey transport is poorly understood. These studies have indicated that terrestrial prey capture has unique kinematic and motor patterns, whereas the other behaviors are quite similar to one another. Using high-speed video analysis, the kinematics of aquatic prey transport in larval Ambystoma tigrinum are described using both lateral and ventral views. These kinematic patterns are statistically compared with the kinematic patterns of aquatic prey capture, terrestrial prey capture and terrestrial prey transport. Statistical analyses allow us to assess the similarities and differences among the four behaviors and to determine the effect of the metamorphic environmental transition (water to land) and morphological changes of the feeding mechanism (suction-to lingual-based) on feeding kinematics. Our data do not support the notion that lingual-based terrestrial prey capture uses unique kinematic patterns compared with the other three behaviors, which consist of similar movements. Rather, each of the feeding behaviors has unique kinematic features that distinguish it from the others. In addition, variation in tiger salamander feeding kinematics is more a function of the feeding event (whether it is capture or transport) than of the environment in which the feeding takes place or the morphology of the feeding mechanism. Finally, we encourage the use of parsimony-based methods of phylogenetic analysis to analyze shared traits (such as kinematic and/or electromyographic variables) in comparative studies of behavior within a single species.

AB Nonfeeding larval forms of echinoderms are believed to have evolved repeatedly from feeding larval forms, and these transformations usually result in major shifts in morphogenesis. Current hypotheses on form change invoke relaxation of stabilizing selection on traits that function in feeding, coupled with selection for rapid development of juvenile traits. However, comparative evidence from 51 species of nonfeeding larvae, representing 19 independent origins, suggests that body form, patterns of ciliation, and possibly buoyancy reflect functional requirements for maintenance of swimming performance. Nonfeeding larvae with body lengths less than 600 mu m usually have several transverse ciliated bands, while those with body lengths greater than 800 mu m usually have uniform ciliation. A preliminary model which compares estimated drag and buoyancy forces with ciliary propulsive forces predicts that bands of simple cilia do not produce sufficient propulsive forces to permit swimming in larger larvae. For larger larvae, increases in areal coverage of cilia may be required to produce propulsive forces sufficient to oppose drag and buoyancy forces and permit movement. For these larger larvae, estimates of water velocities at the tips of uniform arrays of cilia are well below the upper limits of water movements by cilia of echinoderms. Functional constraints on nonfeeding larval forms should be considered, along with (above mentioned) current hypotheses, in explanations of morphogenetic changes associated with transition from feeding to nonfeeding larval development.

AB A statistical and functional relationship between neural canal anatomy and locomotor mode is demonstrated in living marine mammals of the Order Carnivora. This relationship is interpreted to be the result of differential innervation and territory of musculature involved in generating the six locomotor patterns analyzed. This osteological reflection of a behavioral trait allows prediction of locomotor pattern in extinct genera of closely related taxa. The robust data allow such predictions even when a considerable number of presacral vertebrae are missing in the fossil specimens. In some cases, these predictions conflict with interpretations based solely on limb osteology.

AB The behavioral feeding ecology of Ephemerella needhami McDunnough (Ephemeroptera: Ephemerellidae) larvae was studied using field observations, gut content analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and videomacroscopy. These techniques allowed correlation of behavior, microhabitat, and diet. Field studies showed that the mayfly larvae were intimately associated with the filamentous green alga Cladophora. Development of middle and late instar larvae always coincided with the early season development of Cladophora mats. Behavioral observation and gut analysis indicated that detritus and epiphytic diatoms associated with Cladophora filaments, as well as the filaments themselves, constituted the primary diet of E. needhami. The mayfly is primarily a collector-gatherer detritivore but also qualifies as a herbivore and a carnivore. The larvae possess several morphological and behavioral traits that are apparent adaptations for living with Cladophora. Life cycle synchronization, spination, coloration, and feeding behavior allow E. needhami to use Cladophora as a substrate, refuge, food, and food-gathering device.
