AB Traits-based analyses of insect assemblages support biomonitoring programme objectives. To date, however, few traits-based metrics have demonstrated the degree of sensitivity or discriminatory power required by biomonitoring programmes. Trait information used for analyses is typically based on static descriptions of dynamic communities and is attributed only to taxonomic units. Given that traits can vary even among specimens from the same species, quantifying trait variation and its consequences could be essential for successful traits-based biomonitoring. Here, we study the consequences of measuring trait expression among individual specimens versus assigning trait states from published databases at the taxon level (genus or family) for the interpretation of trait patterns within aquatic insect assemblages. Specifically, do database body size trait states accurately reflect measured body size values of aquatic insects collected in biomonitoring samples and should body size data be aggregated at the taxon level or assessed at the specimen level to detect differences among sites? We assessed body size, a continuous trait linked to fundamental organism properties and ecological function, for four orders of aquatic insects: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata. Invertebrate samples were collected from the Miramichi River basin (New Brunswick, Canada) according to the Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network method. Concordance between measured specimen sizes and published trait states was poor; 55% of taxa expressed body sizes considerably smaller or larger than assigned database states. Recalibration of size classes based on specimen measurements yielded three size classes that facilitated detection of assemblage-aggregated size differences among reference sites. Measured body size trait values were able to distinguish these differences in community structure, while values derived from databases yielded erroneous patterns in the size structure among sites. Gaining accurate ecological insights from traits-based biomonitoring may require assessing trait properties at the scale of individual specimens. The benefits of this approach, however, should be balanced against additional effort required in the context of specific study or programme objectives.

AB Seasonal droughts are predictable components of arid-land stream hydrology, and many arid-land aquatic taxa have adapted to their extreme environment. However, climate change is altering this predictable hydrology, producing longer and more severe droughts and creating novel disturbance regimes for resident organisms. The hydrologic transitions from flowing stream to fragmented pools to dry stream bed are frequently associated with steep decreases in taxonomic and functional diversity, referred to as thresholds of biodiversity loss. Less is known about how taxa respond between these thresholds, as fragmented pools gradually dry and abiotic conditions intensify. While an increasingly extreme environment may be expected to reduce taxonomic and trait richness, species adapted to predictable seasonal fragmentation may be resistant to declining water levels until all surface water is lost. We used aquatic mesocosms to test two competing hypotheses of the relationship between richness and pool drying for arid-land stream invertebrates: (i) the drought vulnerability hypothesis (richness gradually decreases with drying) and (ii) the drought resistance hypothesis (richness remains constant until complete drying occurs). We inoculated replicate mesocosms with aquatic invertebrates from arid-land streams in Arizona, U.S.A., and applied three drying treatments representing a continuum of drying stress commonly observed in local streams during the summer dry season (water depths: 10, 7 and 1cm). Mesocosms were covered to restrict dispersal and colonisation processes and to isolate resistance (in situ survival of species) from resilience (community recovery following disturbance). After 45days, we destructively sampled all invertebrates in the mesocosms and calculated various taxonomic and functional trait metrics. Taxonomic richness and composition did not differ between drying treatments, providing strong support for the drought resistance hypothesis. Severe drying was associated with lower invertebrate abundances and higher densities than the moderate and control treatments. This finding suggests that density-dependent processes generated by decreased available habitat may be more important determinants of community composition during droughts than abiotic stress in this system. We observed a near-complete overlap of trophic traits (body size and functional feeding group) and resistance traits (respiration mode and diapause) among the three treatments. This high functional redundancy may provide a buffer against changes to ecosystem functioning, even in cases of severe-drying-induced habitat contraction and fragmentation.

AB Despite a general recognition that benthic macroinvertebrates respond to changes in hydrological connectivity within floodplain ecosystems, no consensus about patterns in community structure and ecosystem processes across large scales and different climates has yet been established. Such knowledge is necessary since anthropogenic activities continue to alter the natural hydrogeomorphology of large floodplains, with most consequences for aquatic communities remaining unknown. Using information from six large rivers located in four different climate regions (humid subtropical, maritime temperate, Mediterranean and dry semi-arid), we compared benthic macroinvertebrate responses along lateral gradients of hydrological connectivity. We tested hypotheses related to differences among climate regions and to similar hydrological constraints within any one climate. The large geographical scale covered by this study provides the first comprehensive comparison of aquatic community patterns across hydrological gradients under different climatic settings. Multivariate ordinations demonstrated a higher overlap of trait community composition (50% variance explained by the first two axes) than taxonomic composition (15%) among floodplains, displaying high interclimate trait stability. The taxonomy-based ordination separated the subtropical floodplain, with an average 86% of non-insect taxa, from the insect-dominated temperate, Mediterranean and semi-arid floodplains (with >50% insect abundance). In the trait-based ordination, large body size (60% of organisms >4cm) and long lifespan duration (80% of organisms) discriminated the subtropical from the other five studied floodplains. Across a gradient of lateral connectivity, linear mixed effect (LME) models supported seven of 15 hypotheses, which suggests remarkably consistent macroinvertebrate patterns in floodplains regardless of the climate regime. Taxon and trait richness were positively related and peaked at sites of intermediate hydrological connectivity. Our predictions about the feeding guilds of macroinvertebrates (e.g. that shredders and scrapers would be more abundant in connected channels, and predators and deposit feeders at isolated sites) were more strongly supported by the data than those about life history (e.g. plurivoltinism and short lifespan would be better represented in connected channels). This difference was related to the influence of extended periods of hydrological disconnection as disturbance in addition to flooding. Trait stability across hydrological connectivity provides a meaningful ecological context for the comparison of the macroinvertebrate benthos among climatic zones, where taxonomic composition differs strongly. In addition, trait similarities and dissimilarities found in this study suggest that large-scale biogeographical filters do operate on communities, resulting in different trait combinations in temperate and Mediterranean floodplains when compared to semi-arid and subtropical environments. The extent to which global macroecological factors (i.e. climate, dispersal history) and local biotic and abiotic factors (i.e. drought frequency, habitat structure, water chemistry) contribute to this difference requires further investigation.

AB Leaf litter in streams is exploited by benthic macroinvertebrates, and leaf traits may influence colonisation by this group. This study aimed to compare the leaf decomposition rates, structure, and composition of the macroinvertebrate fauna colonising the litter of plant species with contrasting leaf traits. Litter bags from two native plant species (Sebastiania brasiliensis and Campomanesia xanthocarpa) and two non-natives (Hovenia dulcis and Platanus x acerifolia) were incubated in a subtropical stream. After 7, 14, 21, and 28 days, four leaf bags for each species were removed, and the leaf decomposition rates, density of organisms and trophic guilds, taxonomic richness, and functional composition of the macroinvertebrates were compared. The decomposition rates and densities of organisms, shredders, and collector-gatherers were higher for the leaves considered to be better quality, with lower C:N and Lignin:N ratios (from S. brasiliensis and H. dulcis). Additionally, the taxonomic and functional compositions of the macroinvertebrates were different for these leaves. In contrast, the species richness and density of the other guilds showed no significant difference between species. This study shows that detritivorous groups prefer leaves of better quality, and most results may be influenced by the high nutritional content and low amount of compounds that complicate fragmentation, such as tannins, lignin, and cellulose. Therefore, the effects of the replacement of riparian plant species on the local macrofauna depend of the traits of the introduced and replaced plant, regardless of their origin.

AB The 'diversity-stability hypothesis', in which higher species diversity within biological communities buffers the risk of ecological collapse, is now generally accepted. However, empirical evidence for a relationship between beta-diversity (spatial turnover in community structure) and temporal stability in community structure remains equivocal, despite important implications for theoretical ecology and conservation biology. Here, we report strong beta-diversity-stability relationships across a broad sample of fish taxa on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. These relationships were robust to random sampling error and spatial and environmental factors, such as latitude, reef size and isolation. While beta-diversity was positively associated with temporal stability at the community level, the relationship was negative for some taxa, for example surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), one of the most abundant reef fish families. This demonstrates that the beta-diversity-stability relationship should not be indiscriminately assumed for all taxa, but that a species' risk of extirpation in response to disturbance is likely to be taxon specific and trait based. By combining predictions of spatial and temporal turnover across the study area with observations in marine-protected areas, we conclude that protection alone does not necessarily confer temporal stability and that taxon-specific considerations will improve the outcome of conservation efforts.

AB Common reed (Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.) is distributed widely throughout the world with various ecotypes. This research compares the functional traits and biomass allocation patterns of two contrasting reed ecotypes. Twelve pairs of aquatic and terrestrial reed samples were collected in northern China. Significant differences in functional traits between the two reed ecotypes were observed, while biomass allocation patterns of reed organs did not differ significantly except for at the root. The dry matter content (DMC) in the whole of the reed plant, leaf, root, and rhizome was higher; while the specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length (SRL) were lower in terrestrial versus aquatic reed. The biomass allocation in organs of the two forms of reed was isometric, only root in the terrestrial habitat increased faster with an increase in the whole plant biomass. It can be affirmed that aquatic and terrestrial reed that adapt to different environments generally has distinct leaf and root functional traits but isometric biomass allocation patterns. This suggests different resource acquisition strategies: (1) aquatic reed grows faster with high SLA and SRL and is more responsive to the environment, while (2) terrestrial reed with high DMC grows slower and is less responsive to the adverse environment (e.g. dry soil conditions).

AB Although the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system exports large amounts of nutrients to the Northern Gulf of Mexico annually, nutrient limitation of primary productivity still occurs offshore, acting as one of the major factors controlling local phytoplankton biomass and community structure. Bioassays were conducted for 48 hrs at two stations adjacent to the river plumes in April and August 2012. High Performance of Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) combined with ChemTax and a Fluorescence Induction and Relaxation (FIRe) system were combined to observe changes in the phytoplankton community structure and photosynthetic activity. Major fluorescence parameters (F-o, F-v/F-m) performed well to reveal the stimulating effect of the treatments with nitrogen (N-nitrate) and with nitrogen plus phosphate (+NPi). HPLC/ChemTax results showed that phytoplankton community structure shifted with nitrate addition: we observed an increase in the proportion of diatoms and prasinophytes and a decrease in cyanobacteria and prymnesiophytes. These findings are consistent with predictions from trait-based analysis which predict that phytoplankton groups with high maximum growth rates (mu(max)) and high nutrient uptake rates (V-max) readily take advantage of the addition of limiting nutrients. Changes in phytoplankton community structure, if persistent, could trigger changes of particular organic matter fluxes and alter the micro-food web cycles and bottom oxygen consumption.

AB Rapid advances in molecular microbial ecology have yielded an unprecedented amount of data about the evolutionary relationships and functional traits of microbial communities that regulate global geochemical cycles. Biogeochemical models, however, are trailing in the wake of the environmental genomics revolution, and such models rarely incorporate explicit representations of bacteria and archaea, nor are they compatible with nucleic acid or protein sequence data. Here, we present a functional gene-based framework for describing microbial communities in biogeochemical models by incorporating genomics data to provide predictions that are readily testable. To demonstrate the approach in practice, nitrogen cycling in the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) was modeled to examine key questions about cryptic sulfur cycling and dinitrogen production pathways in OMZs. Simulations support previous assertions that denitrification dominates over anammox in the central Arabian Sea, which has important implications for the loss of fixed nitrogen from the oceans. Furthermore, cryptic sulfur cycling was shown to attenuate the secondary nitrite maximum often observed in OMZs owing to changes in the composition of the chemolithoautotrophic community and dominant metabolic pathways. Results underscore the need to explicitly integrate microbes into biogeochemical models rather than just the metabolisms they mediate. By directly linking geochemical dynamics to the genetic composition of microbial communities, the method provides a framework for achieving mechanistic insights into patterns and biogeochemical consequences of marine microbes. Such an approach is critical for informing our understanding of the key role microbes play in modulating Earth's biogeochemistry.

AB Alternative stable states have long been thought to exist in natural communities, but direct evidence for their presence and for the environmental switches that cause them has been scarce. Using a combination of greenhouse and field experiments, we investigated the environmental drivers associated with two distinctive herbaceous communities in coastal ecosystems in New Zealand. In a mosaic unrelated to micro-topography, a community dominated largely by native turf species (notably Leptinella dioica, Samolus repens, and Selliera radicans) alternates with vegetation comprising exotic (i.e., nonnative) pasture species (notably Agrostis stolonifera, Holcus lanatus, Lolium perenne, and Trifolium repens). The species of these two communities differ in functional characters related to leaf longevity and growth rate, and occupy soils of differing nitrogen levels. Both spatial and environmental factors influenced the species composition locally. Reciprocal transplants of soil, with and without associated vegetation, showed that a native turf community developed when sward or soil from either community was bounded by turf, and a pasture community developed when sward or soil from either community was surrounded by pasture. In artificial mixed communities in the greenhouse, turf was able to invade the pasture community where the vegetation was clipped to simulate grazing, and also where Trifolium was removed and/or salt spray was applied. The pasture community invaded the turf where Trifolium was present or nitrogen was added. These results were supported by trends in experimentally manipulated field plots, where the amount of turf cover increased when nitrogen was kept low and when salt spray was applied, whereas pasture cover increased in the absence of salt spray. Thus, persistence of the native turf community is dependent on grazing, both directly and via its effect on keeping nitrogen levels low by excluding the exotic, nitrogen-fixing Trifolium, and by exposing the vegetation to salt spray. If any of these factors change, there could be a state change to pasture dominance that might be resistant to reversion to turf. Managing such coastal herbaceous communities therefore requires an understanding of the environmental and species characteristics that maintain alternative states.

AB Benthic macroinvertebrates and wild fish aggregating in the vicinity of four Mediterranean fish farms were sampled. Concentrations of metals and other elements were measured in macrofaunal taxa and in fish tissues (muscle, liver, gills, bone, gonad, stomach, intestine, and stomach content). Biological and geochemical characteristics play an important role in metal accumulation in benthic invertebrates, and consequently in metal transfer to higher trophic levels. Macroinvertebrates accumulated lower concentrations of most metals and elements than their respective sediment, except As, P, Na, Zn and Cd. Elemental concentrations of benthic organisms increased with increasing sediment metal content, except Cd, and with % silt, refractory organic matter and chlorophyll-a of sediment due to the influence of sediment geochemistry on metal bioavailability. Tolerant species were found to accumulate higher concentrations of most metals and elements, except for Cd, than equilibrium species. The ecological and morphological characteristics of the benthic invertebrates can affect the bioaccumulation of metals and elements in macrobenthos. Hg and P were found to increase their concentrations from zoobenthos to wild fish aggregating around fish cages feeding on macrofauna. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We tested the ability of juvenile sporophytes of two coexisting kelps native to Portugal, Laminaria ochroleuca and Saccorhiza polyschides, to adjust their photosynthesis and respiration to increasing sea water temperatures. These responses were measured for S. polyschides from both the subtidal and the intertidal habitat, and for L. ochroleuca from the intertidal habitat. L. ochroleuca showed a reduced ability to acclimatize to changing conditions, whereas S. polyschides demonstrated a larger physiological flexibility. These findings are connected with the life-history traits of these species. Additionally, optimum temperatures for the primary production of kelps were assessed, indicating higher values for inter- than subtidal S. polyschides. Significant physiological differences between inter- and subtidal S. polyschides were observed, based on metabolic rates of primary production and dark respiration. This study suggests that, under a warming climate scenario, responses can significantly vary for each species, and that L. ochroleuca is more susceptible to ocean warming than S. polyschides, due to larger acclimatization capacity of the latter.

AB The taxonomic and functional structure of the subtidal nematode assemblages from a temperate estuary (Mondego estuary, Portugal) was studied, focussing on different taxonomic levels (genus, family and order), on single functional groups and on multiple biological traits. Based on taxonomic levels and on four biological traits (feeding type, life strategy, tail and body shape), the analysis of the nematode assemblage distribution patterns revealed spatial differences but no clear temporal pattern. At the family and genus level, a separation of the upstream sections was observed, while a distinction of polyhaline and euhaline areas was less evident. The use of biological traits added new information regarding the relationships between diversity patterns and the environmental variables. Most nematodes encountered along the estuary were non-selective deposit feeders (1B) and omnivores/predators (2B), colonizer-persisters (score of 2 or 3), with clavate-conicocylindrical tails and slender bodies and with a distribution related essentially to salinity, oxygen and chlorophyll a. Applying a Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) showed the role of oxygen concentration in the distribution of the nematode communities. Although the BTA was no more powerful than the traditional taxonomic approach in detecting spatial differences along the Mondego estuary, it has increased our knowledge of the functional structure and characterization of nematode communities in the estuary.

AB We present an integrative model predicting associations among epiphytism, the tank habit, entangling seeds, C-3 vs. CAM photosynthesis, avian pollinators, life in fertile, moist montane habitats, and net rates of species diversification in the monocot family Bromeliaceae. We test these predictions by relating evolutionary shifts in form, physiology, and ecology to time and ancestral distributions, quantifying patterns of correlated and contingent evolution among pairs of traits and analyzing the apparent impact of individual traits on rates of net species diversification and geographic expansion beyond the ancestral Guayana Shield. All predicted patterns of correlated evolution were significant, and the temporal and spatial associations of phenotypic shifts with orogenies generally accorded with predictions. Net rates of species diversification were most closely coupled to life in fertile, moist, geographically extensive cordilleras, with additional significant ties to epiphytism, avian pollination, and the tank habit. The highest rates of net diversification were seen in the bromelioid tank-epiphytic clade (D-crown = 1.05 My(-1)), associated primarily with the Serra do Mar and nearby ranges of coastal Brazil, and in the core tillandsioids (D-crown = 0.67 My(-1)), associated primarily with the Andes and Central America. Six large-scale adaptive radiations and accompanying pulses of speciation account for 86% of total species richness in the family. This study is among the first to test a priori hypotheses about the relationships among phylogeny, phenotypic evolution, geographic spread, and net species diversification, and to argue for causality to flow from functional diversity to spatial expansion to species diversity.

AB One of the most controversially discussed topics in current biodiversity-ecosystem function research is the transfer of results from experimental and theoretical studies to natural ecosystems. At the same time, monitoring data on biodiversity are requested as key indicators for the state of an ecosystem in most environmental evaluation frameworks. We analyse two monitoring data sets comprising information on abundance and biomass of macrozoobenthos communities in the German Wadden Sea in order to evaluate how much information monitoring data on biodiversity provide concerning ecosystem functioning and what implications this information (or the lack thereof) has for future monitoring programmes. Our results show a positive correlation between number of species of macrozoobenthos and its standing stock. Despite differences in overall biomass and individual size in different functional groups, this correlation remained consistent for different feeding guilds and therefore is likely to be independent of certain species traits. Moreover, functional turnover analyses indicate that increasing species richness is needed to maintain biomass levels over increasing periods of time. Whereas our data thus corroborate predictions from theory, we could not determine any causal relationships, because monitoring data commonly include only vague proxies for very few functional parameters, in our case standing biomass as a proxy for production. As to the use of diversity as an indicator for ecosystem functioning, we advise that management decisions are to be based on verified causal relationships and therefore strongly suggest the general incorporation of unambiguous proxies for functional parameters in the measuring campaigns of monitoring programmes.

AB Marine ecosystems are typically under the influence of multiple Human activities, which hinders the assessment of the effects of a specific activity upon their biological assemblages. In this context, distance-based linear models were used to analyse the relationships of several structural and functional metrics of both macroinvertebrates and fish assemblages with the specific types of pressure (i.e. fishing, organic, physical and non-point-source) as well as the global pattern of cumulative pressures. Both indicators detected similarly the effects of the global degradation and the analyses of the metrics' sensitivity (given the expected response trends) suggested that the non-point-source had the strongest contribution to this pattern, followed by organic pollution. The difficulties of assessing single pressure effects in a multiple pressures context are discussed. An approach based on the previous identification of pressure sources, a sampling strategy directed to those sources, together with indicator response is highly recommended, as it could be the only way to accurately predict human-induced changes on broad range ecosystems, with likely implications in the success of marine management plans.

AB Balanced harvesting, where species or individuals are exploited in accordance with their productivity, has been proposed as a way to minimize the effects of fishing on marine fish communities and ecosystems. This calls for a thorough examination of the consequences balanced harvesting has on fish community structure and yield. We use a size- and trait-based model that resolves individual interactions through competition and predation to compare balanced harvesting with traditional selective harvesting, which protects juvenile fish from fishing. Four different exploitation patterns, generated by combining selective or unselective harvesting with balanced or unbalanced fishing, are compared. We find that unselective balanced fishing, where individuals are exploited in proportion to their productivity, produces a slightly larger total maximum sustainable yield than the other exploitation patterns and, for a given yield, the least change in the relative biomass composition of the fish community. Because fishing reduces competition, predation and cannibalism within the community, the total maximum sustainable yield is achieved at high exploitation rates. The yield from unselective balanced fishing is dominated by small individuals, whereas selective fishing produces a much higher proportion of large individuals in the yield. Although unselective balanced fishing is predicted to produce the highest total maximum sustainable yield and the lowest impact on trophic structure, it is effectively a fishery predominantly targeting small forage fish.

AB Background: Under predicted climate change scenarios, estuaries and deltas face increased threats to biological sustainability. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA forms the upstream component of the largest estuary on the Pacific coast of the Americas. It is a Mediterranean system in steep ecological decline under threat from current and potential climate changes.
   Goal: Illustrate how climate change impacts on an already fragile system can be monitored with new, advanced remote sensing methods. Describe how remote sensing data can improve monitoring of ecosystem changes. Use examples from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California to illustrate some of the types of ecosystem changes that are expected with climate change, such as changing species composition and dominance, changes in environmental conditions like salinity, water and air temperatures, and precipitation patterns. Show how imaging spectroscopy can provide information about the dynamics of native and invasive estuarine plant communities.
   Data: Airborne HyMap imaging spectroscopy data of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta collected in June for the years 2004 through 2008. Approximately 65 flightlines covered the Delta each year with 3 x 3 m spatial resolution. Concurrent field data recorded geographical locations and phenology of different aquatic plant species. Airborne LiDAR data rasterized at 1 x 1 m, collected in winter 2007 for the entire Delta, was used to calculate light interception by riparian tree canopies.
   Analysis method: We used hyperspectral image analysis in various classification algorithms to perform vegetation type and species mapping, and estimate plant densities and functional traits. A radiative transfer model was applied to LiDAR data to estimate the effects of riparian tree canopies on the irradiance budget of the surface waters of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as a surrogate for potential water temperature increases.
   Results: New remote sensing techniques and data detected and measured the density and other functional traits of plant communities and species in this delta. Examining the year-to-year locations of pixels containing invasive species shows that they have high rates of persistence, and that the predicted increases in water temperature may improve the habitat conditions for invasive aquatic plant species. Other changes, such as altered precipitation patterns, may affect the hydrograph of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and its turbidity that could further improve the habitat for non-native species, although sea level rise and increasing upstream salinity might produce the opposite effect.
   Conclusions: The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Estuary face ecosystem problems that are characteristic of most Mediterranean estuaries. Interactions between the biological and physical conditions in the Delta affect the trajectory of dominance by native and invasive aquatic plant species. Trends in growth and community characteristics associated with predicted impacts of climate change (sea level rise, warmer temperatures, changes in the hydrograph with high winter and low summer outflows) do not provide simple predictions. Individually, the impact of specific environmental changes on the biological components can be predicted, however it is the complex interactions of biological communities with the suite of physical changes that make predictions uncertain. Systematic monitoring of these estuarine environments is critical to achieving sustainable management of these ecosystems and providing the data needed to document and understand change and to identify successful adaptation strategies.

AB Ocean biogeochemistry (OBGC) models span a wide variety of complexities, including highly simplified nutrient-restoring schemes, nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) models that crudely represent the marine biota, models that represent a broader trophic structure by grouping organisms as plankton functional types (PFTs) based on their biogeochemical role (dynamic green ocean models) and ecosystem models that group organisms by ecological function and trait. OBGC models are now integral components of Earth system models (ESMs), but they compete for computing resources with higher resolution dynamical setups and with other components such as atmospheric chemistry and terrestrial vegetation schemes. As such, the choice of OBGC in ESMs needs to balance model complexity and realism alongside relative computing cost. Here we present an intercomparison of six OBGC models that were candidates for implementation within the next UK Earth system model (UKESM1). The models cover a large range of biological complexity (from 7 to 57 tracers) but all include representations of at least the nitrogen, carbon, alkalinity and oxygen cycles. Each OBGC model was coupled to the ocean general circulation model Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) and results from physically identical hindcast simulations were compared. Model skill was evaluated for biogeochemical metrics of global-scale bulk properties using conventional statistical techniques. The computing cost of each model was also measured in standardised tests run at two resource levels. No model is shown to consistently outperform all other models across all metrics. Nonetheless, the simpler models are broadly closer to observations across a number of fields and thus offer a high-efficiency option for ESMs that prioritise high-resolution climate dynamics. However, simpler models provide limited insight into more complex marine biogeochemical processes and ecosystem pathways, and a parallel approach of low-resolution climate dynamics and high-complexity biogeochemistry is desirable in order to provide additional insights into biogeochemistry-climate interactions.

AB Bronze Age research in the eastern Baltic was actually initiated with the very first archaeological settlement excavations at Asva and Iru in Estonia and KlarAukalns in Latvia in the 1930s. Before the discovery of these hill fort sites the material culture remains were so minimal that researchers even expressed doubt concerning the existence of a proper Bronze Age or any remarkable settlement activity in this region. The quantity and quality of finds from these hill forts resulted in completely new insights into a fairly unknown cultural past of the eastern Baltic region. Quite soon the Estonian prehistorian Harry Moora reached the conclusion that the cultural life in the Early Metal Ages was against all expectations a very active and developed one, and vividly benefitting from intercultural contacts. Interestingly, Moora also stated that the rich archaeological material from these newly discovered sites indicated that the scarceness of grave and hoard finds (containing metals) need not necessarily correspond to the social and cultural reality of the past and that local deposition processes and customs should be considered. Consequently, there was no reason to believe that eastern Baltic societies suffered metal-poor or low-level economic conditions and cultural developments (see Chapter 1).
   Unfortunately, this was just a promising start of Bronze Age research that, as the entire methodology and working practice in eastern Baltic archaeology, could not be developed further. This was mainly due to the political conditions and circumstances throughout the post-World War II period and the times of the Iron Curtain. After the continuation of excavations at Asva on the Island of Saaremaa in the late 1940s and mid-1960s and other archaeological campaigns in the newly discovered site of Ridala (with palisade structures; excavated 1961-1963) in western Estonia preliminary results only and a few minor articles have been published. In his dissertation in 1970 Vello Laugas gave a detailed overview of the current state of research into the Bronze and Early Iron Ages in Estonia, also introducing the main results from earlier and his own archaeological investigations at Asva (years 1965-1966). The comprehensive account of facts leading to his chronological system and periodisation, particularly his interpretation and discussion of socio-economic processes and developments, were all grounded on archaeological objects, types and groups from Bronze Ages settlement sites. Because of remaining unpublished and the general isolation of Estonian archaeology in Soviet time Lougas' work could never be received or reviewed by any international research platform. The Bronze Age research of other Baltic Sea regions was simply denied access to the archaeological progress of the Baltic countries, also during the next decades. Laugas had a sort of autonomous position in the field of Bronze and Iron Age research in the Soviet republic of Estonia. Being practically the only academic authority specialising in and permitted to study and investigate the heritage from these prehistoric time periods, he also had to cover a large scope of other duties in salvation and heritage management. Accordingly, there was not much room and spirit left for theoretically reflective research, not to mention the danger of being steadily confronted with political ideological doctrines in Soviet archaeology and history sciences. When reflecting his (not always fully reproducible) applied methods in archaeological work and the missing data and documentations of significant archaeological sites and contexts, this background of political and economic circumstances needs to be reconsidered (Chapter 6). This concerns in particular the meteorite crater area of Kaali on Saaremaa and the archaeological excavations and the reporting under his direction (in 1976-1979), which have left some confusion and many open questions behind.
   In the late 1980s Valter Lang initiated a proper landscape and settlement archaeology in Estonia with emphasis on palaeogeography and palaeoecology, mainly in the course of studies and fieldworks in coastal areas of north Estonia (including Iru hill fort). His micro-regional and diachronic perspective on the dynamics in the interplay of humans and the environment in this region and on the introduction and development of agriculture also used to consider multidisciplinary studies of grave monuments and funerary customs. The research into stone cist graves as sources of osteoarchaeology and forensic research also helped to formulate new subject matters of social archaeology. Thus, compared to the Island of Saaremaa primarily represented by settlements in the period of study, the north Estonian research area offered a completely different but very convenient situation for developing new theories and models explaining these social and economic processes that are of significance for studies of the Asva settlement phenomenon. The archaeological evidence of land use for animal husbandry and field cultivation made researchers aware of socio-political implications of both the territorial organisation including land ownership and the technological systems behind agriculture. The emergence of a stratified agrarian society with control and ownership over the fertile lands (limestone rendzinas) and the population growth at the end of the Bronze Age as witnessed by the stone cist graves inferred to a drastically increasing social competition. According to Lang's studies, this eventually resulted in more diverse and complex relationships in society and between settlements during the Late Bronze Age. Asva and Iru, for instance, are now perceived as central places and integral in a functionalist perception of a system of interdependent open (single farms) and enclosed (complex) settlements. It is the exclusive occurrence of bronze casting workshops in settlements of hill fort type, a general eastern Baltic phenomenon, that makes the metalwork production perceived as a subject of social power-and-control institutions over supply and trade of metal (and the technology). With"the Late Bronze Age and the metalwork activity in the eastern Baltic the social and economic processes mentioned are viewed in close interaction and connection with the Nordic Bronze Age cultural sphere, with regions such as eastern Sweden and Gotland of southern Scandinavia. These processes, with Asva as a key site, are now viewed from a macro-historical center periphery perspective, situated in a Bronze Age world-system framework (Chapters 3 and 4).
   The recent studies performed by Lembi LOugas, Heidi Luik und Liina Maldre produced large amounts of new data and information on breeding strategies, the exploitation of animals and consumption patterns as well as on different social and technological aspects of craft production. Thus, the current Bronze Age research considers the Asva-type sites as key phenomena in the socio-economic developments in eastern Baltic's prehistory. This study is about completing the material culture studies and comparative analyses initiated by the aforementioned researchers (Lang et al.). In the course of the study, the archaeological groups of metalworking ceramics (moulds) and pottery emerged as illustrious 'materialised' sources of the social life and the economic activities, which allowed contributing to the discussion of the dynamics in the cultural development throughout the Bronze Age in the eastern Baltic region.
   It was the topic of metalwork production and the archaeological evidence in the Estonian Bronze Age settlement sites that offered great potential for developing and discussing the much debated problems of Bronze Age research (Chapter 7). This is first of all due to the peculiar and paradoxical scarcity of archaeologically recorded metal finds in the Bronze Age eastern Baltic, particularly in Estonia. This metal-scarce situation has traditionally been viewed in research from a metal-centred perspective and that of the metal-rich Nordic Bronze Age culture in southern Scandinavia, with countless bronze depositions in graves and hoards as obvious manifestations of social and religious acts. In the eastern Baltic only the Late Bronze Age saw a slight increase in archaeological finds related to metalwork, but hoards and graves containing bronzes remained seldom. Settlement sites of hill fort type emerged at that time, with about 25 of them revealing evidence of local bronze casting production. Since their discovery there has been no doubt about the adoption and utilisation of metalworking technology in this region; however, its impact on society and economy has been perceived fairly differently in research. While emphasis has generally been put on the social significance behind the introduction and the organisation of metalworking production (with socio-political implications of power and control), the technology aspect has been either neglected, underestimated or any advancements and skilled practice in bronze casting have been regarded as minimal However, in a kind of axiomatic way, and always ruled by the applied Nordic perspective, there has been a sort of pessimistic ('metal poor') view of the entire eastern region, namely that Bronze Age societies suffered from sporadic and poor metal supplies. In turn, the eastern Baltic has been perceived either as an economically retarded region or as socio-politically and culturally dependent on the Nordic Bronze Age sphere.
   This is where the ordering and analysing of the archaeological metalwork remains of the Estonian Bronze Age sites led to critically question this paradigmatic approach of overemphasising the socio-economic significance of metals in the study area. This also concerned the neglection of culturally regionally different depositional customs possibly distorting our image of past realities and bronze circulation. In any case, the study of a production place such as Asva leaves no doubt that metals were imported, processed and distributed (and utilised) in regular and fairly large amounts. It also became clear that the current state of research (and knowledge) does not allow yet drawing hasty conclusions about the level of technological and skilled practices in eastern Baltic metalwork. This also concerns the relationship between the bronzeworker and his environment and raises questions such as how cultural, social or religious aspects of the Bronze Age life might have affected any choices and selection of materials and resources in metal production. Thus, the material culture studies performed actually provide us with the insights necessary to assess the social significance and function of bronzes in past societies. Technological innovations as results of intercultural contact are another research issue that emerged from this material-immanent analysis and that is in need of being developed further.
   Part of Chapter 7 is dedicated to the question concerning the striking preference of casting rings (ingots?) in the eastern Baltic production places and in neighbouring regions. Because the dominance of ring-shaped clay moulds is highly visible in the casting debris it is assumed that these ring moulds might reflect an intended standardisation and commoditisation in the production and distribution of bronzes. It is furthermore assumed that the bronze rings served as multi-functional semiproducts that were commoditized valuables facilitating the exchange of agricultural products and livestock. However, as ring ingots they were of particular use and value for the metalworker, i.e. the person who was able to distinguish different material qualities in the processes of technical complexity such as alloying and melting that implied the manipulation of the metal's properties (malleability, colour, hardness, etc.). The ring object allowed easy fragmentation, division and portioning for the crucible melt, it simply fulfilled the requirements in the production process and in the distribution and exchange In practicing ring casting the settlements of Asva type seem indeed to represent a stage in the metallurgy cycle of re-melting and converting scrap bronzes and primary metals to 'ingots' in accordance with the custom and usage in the interregional metal exchange. The actual amounts of objects produced, the intensity and duration of bronze casting as well as the applied skill and expertise in metalwork technology are subject matters of further material studies.
   It has been acknowledged that in view of the economic foundations required for the import, exchange and production of metals, bronzework indeed points to a privileged or even elitist social craft activity, but not necessarily with the postulated implications of social power and control. In view of the social organisation of bronze casting the settlements of Asva and Ridala are remarkable examples of how production activities (not only metalwork) were subject to several social and economic units (households) within the settlement areas. In accordance with the various, apparently simultaneously existing production places, it appears that the major part of the community was actively involved in the complex and consuming processes of bronze casting (e.g. fabrication of moulds). It seems likely that there existed a multi-tiered organisation between the contributing craft persons, those with advanced skills and technological practice able to handle the demanding and complex melting and casting conditions such as air supply, heating procedure, determination of the melting point, etc. However, in consequence the social pattern behind metalwork craft in the Asva milieu appears to have been sort of 'democratised' and bronze casting still a matter of seasonally practised community specialisation. Asva is indeed a key site in the Bronze Age context (and beyond) when it comes to discussions of the social meaning of craft specialisation in theory and archaeological praxis, particularly because of many indications of standardisation in style, design and technique of objects, semi-products and implements related to craft and production. This concerns not only the finds related to metalwork production but also those of the bone and antler industry in the Asva milieu (see also Chapter 11).
   The Asva pottery makes up another big subject matter in the analysis of the archaeological settlement material (Chapter 8), where several morphological, technical and functional utilitarian criteria create a picture of the emergence of various coarse and fine ceramic ware and pottery types. The burnished and profiled bowls, some with handles, are distinctive of the Asva-type ceramics and enrich the range of eastern Baltic pottery groups. They also speak of an advanced technology of ceramic processing. Remarkably, the external influences highly visible in the bowls and their manufacture, design and use seem to have only affected the pottery that represents the sphere of eating and drinking customs, which quantitatively makes up only a minor part in the Asva-type pottery. The jars, food containers and/or cooking pots as the most numerous and homogeneous group (coarse ware pottery) are way less advanced in design and stylistic individuality, and also the creative effort invested in their manufacture seems somewhat restricted. The coarse ware pots, discernible by the shape of the neck and rim parts and particularly by the applied techniques of surface treatment (smoothed, striated or textile imprints) seem to be modest in terms of quality (ware, temper), but apparently sufficient for their usage. The coarse pots, constantly decorated with horizontal rows of pits pressed in neck or shoulder parts of the vessels, display a tradition of the Bronze an Early Iron Age pottery of the northeastern European forest zone and appear to have been resistant to any innovations or implementation of stylistic features. This speaks in favour of a behaviour in style and technique following strict conventions and rules, all manifesting a local pottery tradition where the jars were allowed only very restricted concessions to outside influences (rusticated surfaces, knobs, cordon applications).
   As it is likely that the fine as well as the coarse ware pottery in the settlements of Asva type was locally produced, presumably by both native potters and new arrivals in the community, the causes of this dichotomy have been discussed. First, it has been assumed that the fine ware bowls, showing distinct traits of a central European Urnfield culture milieu, that of the Late Bronze Age Lusatian tradition, might signify or express aspects of both personal use and social identity behind these dishes. The specific use of the Asva-type bowls and their possible (ritual?) contexts of utilisation have also been discussed, but it remains a subject matter to be cleared with further chemical analysis of organic residues (e.g. lipids). However, the dichotomy and exclusive application and combination of decorative elements (pit stamps or striation on jars and imprints of twisted bronze rings and burnish on bowls) were rooted in a cultural traditional disposition. These rules and conventions in regard to style and technique of ceramic work and function were perceived and communicated in the given Bronze Age society, and therefore keenly respected by the potters. That is why it has been assumed that both the persistence and the openness for innovation or implementation of foreign elements highly visible in these two ceramic groups of the Asva-type sites are the results of a collective and dualistic habitus, a phenomenon that has been described in socio-anthropological literature. Accordingly, the coarse pots and large bowls could be understood as complementary representatives of two realms: that of the inner, the domestic, and that of the outer, the public. The jars as multi-purpose vessels used for storage and preparation of food on the one hand, and the hanging and the cup-like bowls used to prepare and serve special liquids or ingredients on the other, seem to represent different spheres of closed and private household activities against 'exclusive' table and drinking manners (as open and communicative acts).
   Furthermore, the interconnection and coexistence of old and new elements in style and technique of the Asva-type pottery illustrate not only the integration of the coastal regions of western Estonia in a large interregional contact network, but also the complex ways and mechanisms in the transmission and diffusion of cultural stimuli and innovations eventually manifested in local ceramic groups (or style/culture provinces). The foreign characteristics and features on the bowls in the Asva pottery seem to be distributed in diverse and eclectic ways, with stylistic influences deriving from various geographical regions such as western and central Poland, southern and eastern Sweden and Gotland. In sum, these different, rather sporadic and changing directions of cultural influences and contacts give the Asva-type bowls an odd impression of a creolisation in style and technique. Their exclusive occurrence in the Estonian Late Bronze Age sites (Asva, Ridala, Kaali and Iru) only, while missing in Latvian and Lithuanian hill forts, and their sudden disappearance from the record with the decline of this very settlement type make them appear as evidence and symbols of social gestures.
   In the final conclusion the changes in society, economy and settlement in eastern Baltic Bronze Age have been discussed opposing the theories of the current re earch with the author's own material culture studies (Chapter 13). Places such as Asva, occurring in the Late Bronze Age on the archaeological map, do not only represent a new settlement type of permanent stationarity and centrality. Characteristic is the agrarian and maritime-based subsistence economy, complemented by various branches of secondary product processing and exclusive crafts (e.g. metalworking production). It has been asked whether the archaeologically studied settlements and the various production activities correspond to the postulates of sociopolitical relations determined by power and control based primarily on agriculture and metalwork. The Island of Saaremaa seems to reveal a slightly different, complex picture in comparison with hill forts of the eastern Baltic mainland: with Asva and complementary all-season activities, with hunting and fishing practices not only widening the range of subsistence practices. Particularly seal hunting and seasonality give reason to reassess the society relations and the settlement organisation behind this complex subsistence and craft production pattern. Both seasonality (i.e. climate and environmental aspects) and community specialisation (seal hunting strategies) need to be considered when applying theoretical concepts of hierarchisation and multi-tiered social organisation to the eastern Baltic Bronze Age cultural milieu, that is when implying chiefdom-like structures, elites or craft professionals.
   In dealing with the causes and factors of the societal change an attempt at an alternative explaination of the emergence of the Asva-type settlements against the neglected background of the role of seal hunting in Bronze Age settlement economy has been made. Accordingly, the maritime character of the studied sites on Saaremaa has been viewed from the perspective of seal exploitation as one of most eminent (marine) resources. The large percentage of seal bones among the rich osteological find material is undoubtedly a clear indicator of the extensive use and exploitation of seal products (blubber, leather). In any case, the subsistence of the Asva and Ridala hill forts was apparently not based on mixed farming and processing of secondary agrarian products alone like in the hill forts of the mainland. It seems also likely that seal populations and hunting grounds in southeastern Saaremaa (and the Gulf of Riga) have determined the location selection of the Bronze Age sites, particularly in a geographical landscape with limited, rather sporadic distribution of fertile soils (alvar or loo) for field cultivation and grazing cattle. Furthermore it has been hypothesised that settlements such as Asva and Ridala might have emerged from the fusion of conglomeratic, regionally dispersed single farms or households that might have constituted seasonal hunting sites. The merging and culmination of various economic and crafting activities and skills, the sort of communal and 'democratised' participation in exclusive crafts such as metalwork plus the versatile interregional cultural contacts and influences visible in the material culture are aspects and phenomena that could be understand from the perspective of community specialisation. Thus, the marine 'subsistence and the seasonal hunting trips to far regions in the Baltic following coastal routes could be the main determinant of the changing development in society and economy of Bronze Age Saaremaa. Not only the form of settlement organisation and the nature and complexity of social relations in community but also the character and the practice of a maritime settlement economy of Asva and its participation in the communication network of the Bronze Age Baltic Sea appear in a new light.
   This study provides a presentation, order and analysis of archaeological findings and contexts that are treated as representative, 'materialised' sources of social and economic activities and that are considered as significant for the understanding of the major cultural processes taking place in the local settlement milieu throughout the Late Bronze Age. With this material immanent approach applied to archaeological remains of an outstanding quality and informative value and in connection with current and forthcoming insights from archaeozoological and -botanical research we possibly will be able to reconstruct the basic conditions, actions and choices of Bronze Age communities when adapting to their environment. This all leads to discussing the possible causes and factors behind these societal changes primarily visible in the archaeological settlement milieu. However, in regard to the social patterns behind settlement economy and craft as well as the territorial use and perception of the surrounding landscape, many questions on the entire Estonian Bronze Age settlement phenomenon still remain to be answered.
   In any case, the Asva site has the potential of taking a key position in future Bronze Age research. The reason is the quality and spectrum of the archaeological material and the data and information available. Considering the excellent conditions of preservation of bone material, for instance, the current interdisciplinary methods of research provide a large set of applications and solutions in approaching the above-mentioned problems and subject matters of research. Some of the formulated questions and hypotheses in connection with the Bronze Age technologies and economic strategies are already subjects of current or applied research projects involving various archaeological subdisciplines (e.g. materials science, experiments, archaeobiology) and building up international research platforms. As the ongoing archaeological excavations at Asva (since 2012), in collaboration with Valter Lang and Lembi Lougas, reveal, a new stage of Bronze Age research in Estonia has already begun.

AB This study was aimed at identifying macroecological patterns in the relationship between phytoplankton cell size, abundance and metabolism in 2 marine ecosystems characterised by marked differences in resource availability and water-column stability. Several patterns emerged: (1) nearly isometric size-scaling of phytoplankton carbon fixation rate was described for both open-ocean and coastal ecosystems (mean slope: 1.17 and 0.90, respectively), supporting the idea that biomass-specific photosynthesis rates are largely independent of cell size; (2) less steep values for the size-scaling of abundance (mean slope: -0.73) were found in the coastal ecosystem compared to the open ocean (mean slope: -1.15); (3) large phytoplankton used more photosynthetic energy than smaller cells in the coastal ecosystem, but a constant flow of energy along the size spectrum was found in the open ocean; and (4) phytoplankton biomass turnover rates were 1 order of magnitude higher in the coastal ecosystem than in the open ocean, implying physiological limitation of phytoplankton growth in the oligotrophic ocean. Bottom-up and top-down mechanisms and their interaction with nutrient supply dynamics were suggested as major factors determining the contrasting phytoplankton size abundance distributions observed in coastal and open-ocean waters.

AB Benthic communities were studied twice (during the autumn and spring) in three Mediterranean coastal lagoons located in Greece (Logarou) and Italy (Cesine and Grado-Marano). The species composition and distribution, community diversity, species richness, dominant taxa and their ecological identity, benthic trophic and biomass size structure were investigated in these lagoons and the results were correlated with the environmental variables. The overall similarity based on species composition and abundance among the lagoons was low due to the differences in the dominant environmental factors, whereas the variations in the community diversity and species richness were mainly related to the degree of marine influence, reflecting the natural structure. The benthic classification indices AMBI, M-AMBI, BENTIX, BO2A, ISD and ISS were applied to assess the ecological status of the lagoons studied. The results revealed that the biotic indices AMBI, M-AMBI, BENTIX, and BO2A were not adequately efficient due to the natural dominance of the tolerant and opportunistic species and the correlation of the species diversity with natural stress. The ISD and ISS, on the other hand, based on size distribution frequencies and on size spectra sensitivity, respectively, showed good discrimination power among the impacted and unimpacted sites. The results indicate that except for species sensitivity, other traits of the communities such as the biomass or size structure could be more robust, sensitive and suitable for assessing the ecological quality of lagoons.

AB Trophic polymorphism, defined as the state in which two or more clearly different feeding functional traits exist within the same population of a species, is general in fishes. In aquatic ecosystems, the fishes often have strong impacts on prey communities as keystone predators, so that phenotypic divergence of their feeding traits can alter biotic and abiotic attributes of environments through changes in the form of trophic interactions. The predator-induced environmental alterations may, in turn, drive evolutionary changes in adaptive traits of themselves as well as of other members in the communities. This process, in which ecology and evolution reciprocally interplay over contemporary time-scales, is termed "eco-evolutionary feedback." In this chapter, we review how and when trophic polymorphism has been generated in fish populations and then discuss what consequences it has in ecological and evolutionary aspect. Special references are made to the case in the ancient Lake Biwa, which has a geological history long enough for divergent fish populations to come to ecological speciation and thus provides a good opportunity to understand how such an evolutionary process diversifies biological communities and consequently ecosystem properties in lakes.

AB To investigate the influence of macrofaunal species on recovery in soft-sediment habitats, a multi-site defaunation experiment was conducted in intertidal sandflats in Mahurangi Harbour, New Zealand. Paired treatment and control plots were monitored for 394 d after defaunation, and the recovery trajectories of individual species and their relationships with environmental factors were evaluated over time. Recruitment events were not apparent drivers of recovery, as we observed a massive recruitment of some species by Day 203, but the abundance of these individuals largely decreased by the end of the experiment, regardless of location in the estuary or hydrodynamics. Multiple regression models revealed highly variable responses, but suggested that several factors including sediment type and post-settlement species interactions contributed to species persistence in recovering plots. Juveniles generally settled at sites where adults from the same taxa occurred in the ambient community, suggesting local settlement patterns. Populations of functionally important surface deposit feeders and suspension feeders, including the large bivalves Austrovenus stutchburyi and Macomona liliana, failed to recover at most sites. The latter is likely one of the major drivers of divergence between disturbed and control plots in this experiment. The generally slow recovery dynamics, the degree of divergence of recovering communities and the failure of some key functions to recover have important implications for the response trajectories of coastal benthic communities subjected to increasingly frequent disturbance.

AB Biotic interactions in aquatic communities are dominated by predation, and the distribution of trophic link strengths in aquatic food webs crucially impacts their dynamics and stability. Although individual body size explains a large proportion of variation in trophic link strengths in aquatic habitats, current predominately body size-based views can gain additional realism by incorporating further traits. Functional traits that potentially affect the strength of trophic links can be classified into three groups: i) body size, ii) traits that identify the spatiotemporal overlap between the predators and their prey, and iii) predator foraging and prey vulnerability traits, which are readily available for many taxa. Relationship between these trait groups and trophic link strength may be further modified by population densities, habitat complexity, temperature and other abiotic factors. I propose here that this broader multi-trait framework can utilize concepts, ideas and existing data from research on metabolic ecology, ecomorphology, animal personalities and role of habitats in community structuring. The framework can be used to investigate non-additive effects of traits on trophic interactions, shed more light on the structuring of local food webs and evaluate the merits of taxonomic and functional group approaches in the description of predator-prey interactions. Development of trait-and size-based descriptions of food webs could be particularly fruitful in limnology given the relative paucity of well resolved datasets in standing waters.

ID PRODUCTIVITY; OCEAN; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; IMPACT; TIME
AB Marine ecosystem models used to investigate how global change affects ocean ecosystems and their functioning typically omit pelagic plankton diversity. Diversity, however, may affect functions such as primary production and their sensitivity to environmental changes. Here we use a global ocean ecosystem model that explicitly resolves phytoplankton diversity by defining subtypes within four phytoplankton functional types (PFTs). We investigate the model's ability to capture diversity effects on primary production under environmental change. An idealized scenario with a sudden reduction in vertical mixing causes diversity and primary-production changes that turn out to be largely independent of the number of coexisting phytoplankton subtypes. The way diversity is represented in the model provides a small number of niches with respect to nutrient use in accordance with the PFTs defined in the model. Increasing the number of phytoplankton subtypes increases the resolution within the niches. Diversity effects such as niche complementarity operate between, but not within PFTs, and are constrained by the variety of traits and trade-offs resolved in the model. The number and nature of the niches formulated in the model, for example via trade-offs or different PFTs, thus determines the diversity effects on ecosystem functioning captured in ocean ecosystem models.

AB Freshwater habitats and organisms are among the most threatened on Earth, and freshwater ecosystems have been subject to large biodiversity losses. We developed a Climate Change Sensitivity (CCS) indicator based on trait information for a selection of stream-and lake-dwelling Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa. We calculated the CCS scores based on ten species traits identified as sensitive to global climate change. We then assessed climate change sensitivity between the six main ecoregions of Sweden as well as the three Swedish regions based on Illies. This was done using biological data from 1,382 stream and lake sites where we compared large-scale (ecoregional) patterns in climate change sensitivity with potential future exposure of these ecosystems to increased temperatures using ensemble-modelled future changes in air temperature. Current (1961 similar to 1990) measured temperature and ensemble-modelled future (2100) temperature showed an increase from the northernmost towards the southern ecoregions, whereas the predicted temperature change increased from south to north. The CCS indicator scores were highest in the two northernmost boreal ecoregions where we also can expect the largest global climate change-induced increase in temperature, indicating an unfortunate congruence of exposure and sensitivity to climate change. These results are of vital importance when planning and implementing management and conservation strategies in freshwater ecosystems, e.g., to mitigate increased temperatures using riparian buffer strips. We conclude that traits information on taxa specialization, e.g., in terms of feeding specialism or taxa having a preference for high altitudes as well as sensitivity to changes in temperature are important when assessing the risk from future global climate change to freshwater ecosystems.

AB We investigated the impact of fish farming on the benthic biota of 2 habitats (sea-grass meadows of Posidonia oceanica and non-vegetated soft bottoms), by examining in detail the nematode assemblages, and the effects of organic enrichment on their abundance, diversity (species richness and trophic diversity), community structure and individual size. All investigated faunal variables differed significantly between impact and control sediments, except for individual nematode biomass. Nematodes displayed reduced biodiversity beneath the investigated fish farms in both vegetated and non-vegetated habitats. The nematode genera Richtersia, Desmoscolex and Halalaimus were highly sensitive to biodeposition and disappeared almost completely in farm sediments, whereas other genera such as Daptonema and Prochromadorella largely increased their relative abundance. The impact of biodeposition was investigated also in terms of K-dominance curves and functional variables (life strategies as maturity index, and functional [i.e. trophic] diversity) which showed that nematodes are very sensitive to this kind of environmental disturbance. Our results indicate that the analysis of nematode assemblage composition, the life traits of the dominant species and the presence/disappearance of certain nematode species represent a reliable tool for monitoring the quality state of marine sediments exposed to fish-farm organic wastes.

AB The California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), a temperate marine region dominated by episodic upwelling, is predicted to experience rapid environmental change in the future due to ocean acidification. The aragonite saturation state within the California Current System is predicted to decrease in the future with near-permanent undersaturation conditions expected by the year 2050. Thus, the CCLME is a critical region to study due to the rapid rate of environmental change that resident organisms will experience and because of the economic and societal value of this coastal region. Recent efforts by a research consortium - the Ocean Margin Ecosystems Group for Acidification Studies (OMEGAS) - has begun to characterize a portion of the CCLME; both describing the spatial mosaic of pH in coastal waters and examining the responses of key calcification-dependent benthic marine organisms to natural variation in pH and to changes in carbonate chemistry that are expected in the coming decades. In this review, we present the OMEGAS strategy of co-locating sensors and oceanographic observations with biological studies on ben-thic marine invertebrates, specifically measurements of functional traits such as calcification-related processes and genetic variation in populations that are locally adapted to conditions in a particular region of the coast. Highlighted in this contribution are (1) the OMEGAS sensor network that spans the west coast of the US from central Oregon to southern California, (2) initial findings of the carbonate chemistry amongst the OMEGAS study sites, and (3) an overview of the biological data that describes the acclimatization and the adaptation capacity of key benthic marine invertebrates within the CCLME.

AB Habitat reserves can promote ecological resilience to climate variability by supporting intact trophic webs and large-bodied individuals(1-3). Protection may also alter community responses to long-term climate change by offering habitat for range-shifting species(4). Here we analyse the species richness, diversity and functional traits of temperate reef fish communities over 20 years in a global warming hotspot and compare patterns in a marine reserve with nearby sites open to fishing. Species richness and diversity oscillated strongly on the decadal scale. Long-term warming signatures were also present as increasing functional trait richness and functional diversity, driven in part by a general increase in herbivores. Nevertheless, reserve sites were distinguished from fished sites by displaying: greater stability in some aspects of biodiversity; recovery of large-bodied temperate species; resistance to colonization by subtropical vagrants; and less pronounced increases in the community-averaged temperature affinity. We empirically demonstrate that protection from fishing has buffered fluctuations in biodiversity and provided resistance to the initial stages of tropicalization.

AB This paper provides the first assessment of the functional diversity (FD) of the Barents Sea fish community. FD is recognized as an important driver of ecosystem functions and, thus, governs the adaptability of ecosystems in the face of disturbance. We integrate ecosystem survey data with an extensive trait matrix and show that fish FD displayed large spatial variation. The study period (2004 to 2009) was characterized by increasing water temperatures and decreasing ice coverage. FD remained stable between years in some areas but showed substantial variation in other areas. For instance, FD was consistently high in the central-west Barents Sea because of the high richness of functionally homogeneous species, whereas it varied strongly in northern areas through time. Such patterns of strong variation were probably driven by the strong warming trend registered in the study period. The species found in the eastern Barents Sea were more functionally distinct than those found in the west. Even though this pattern indicates that assemblages in the eastern areas display high adaptability relative to the number of species present, species loss in these areas will have a higher impact on the FD. Our findings show that FD gives more information about fish community structure and functioning than traditional biodiversity measures, and we suggest that such trait-based methods may constitute useful tools for future monitoring and management of marine fish communities.

AB In response to temporal changes in the quality and availability of food resources, consumers should adjust their foraging behavior in a manner that maximizes energy and nutrient intake and, when resources are limiting, minimizes dietary overlap with other consumers. Floodplains of the Amazon and its lowland tributaries are characterized by strong, yet predictable, hydrological seasonality, seasonal availability of fruits, seeds, and other food resources of terrestrial origin, and diverse assemblages of frugivorous fishes, including morphologically similar species of several characiform families. Here, we investigated how diets of frugivorous fishes in the Amazon change in response to fluctuations in food availability, and how this influences patterns of interspecific dietary overlap. We tested predictions from classical theories of foraging and resource competition by estimating changes in diet breadth and overlap across seasons. We monitored fruiting phenology to assess food availability, and surveyed local fish populations during three hydrological seasons in an oligotrophic river and an adjacent oxbow lake in the Colombian Amazon. We analyzed stomach contents and stable isotope data to evaluate temporal and interspecific relationships for dietary composition, breadth, and overlap. Diets of six species of characiform fishes representing three genera changed according to seasonal fluctuations in food availability, and patterns of diet breadth and interspecific overlap during the peak flood pulse were consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory. During times of high fruit abundance, fishes consumed items to which their functional morphological traits seemed best adapted, potentially enhancing net energy and nutritional gains. As the annual flood pulse subsided and availability of forest food resources in aquatic habitats changed, there was not a consistent pattern of diet breadth expansion or compression. Nonetheless, shifts in both diet composition and stable isotope ratios of consumer tissues during this period resulted in trophic niche segregation in a pattern consistent with competition theory.

AB Haploops nirae is a gregarious tubiculous amphipod which extended its habitat over thousands of hectares in shallow waters of South Brittany bays (Bay of Biscay, Atlantic) over the last decades and created uniquely large and dense tube mats. In the bay of Concameau, we investigated the specific diversity (i.e. species richness and species composition) and the functional structure (using biological traits) of the macrofauna associated with this Haploops community as a comparison with several surrounding soft-sediment communities to determine the effect of this engineer species on ecosystem functions. We showed that the occurrence of Haploops tubes and individuals significantly modifies sediment features (e.g. change in sediment grain size, increase in C and N organic content) but also largely affect species diversity and benthic composition. The species richness was significantly higher in Haploops community but the species assemblage associated with Haploops habitat was very homogeneous compared to the neighboring habitats and unique with 33% of all species exclusively found in this community. Multivariate analysis (dbRDA) revealed that Haploops density was by far the factor explaining the variation in species composition of benthic communities. No differences in species diversity and assemblage were detected in relationship to Haploops density. A biological trait analysis performed on the whole ecosystem (Haploops included) revealed that Haploops largely dominates the functional structure of the Haploops community by its own functional traits. When performed on selected traits of the associated fauna only (Haploops excluded) the functional structure of the Haploops community was characterized by a greatly reduced proportion of small to medium long lived, sensitive to disturbance, free living or burrowing/tube-building filter-feeding species. H. nirae appears to be a bioengineer and a foundation species that largely modifies its hydro-sedimentary features, controlling diversity and abundances of associated species, and creating a complex set of positive and negative interactions so that a unique benthic assemblage is found in sediments they colonized.

AB The gut contents of 2982 specimens of 33 amphipod families, 71 genera and 149 species were examined, representing a high percentage of amphipod diversity in the Iberian Peninsula. Material was collected mainly from sediments, algae and hydroids along the whole coast of the Iberian Peninsula from 1989 to 2011. Although detritus was the dominant food item in the majority of amphipods, gammarideans also included carnivorous (mainly feeding on crustaceans) and herbivorous species (feeding on macroalgal tissues). Our study revealed that general assignment of a type of diet for a whole family is not always adequate. Some families showed a consistent pattern in most of the studied species (Corophiidae, Pontoporeiidae = detritivorous; Oedicerotidae, Phoxocephalidae, Stenothoidae = carnivorous; Ampithoidae = primarily herbivorous on macroalgae), but others included species with totally different feeding strategies. In general terms, detritivorous families were characterized by a stronger mandibular molar, while in carnivorous taxa this feature was less developed or reduced. The percentage of macroalgae in the digestive contents was associated in most cases with a reduction or loss of the mandibular palp. It seems that high trophic diversity in amphipods is a generalized trait along different ecosystems in all latitudes, and could be related to the ecological success of this group in marine benthic communities.

AB Phytoplankton requires a sufficient supply of light and nutrients to grow. At the same time it is largely entrained in water motion and is subject to grazing from planktonic herbivores. The pelagic life of lake phytoplankton is based on 4 pillars: living in suspension, light harvesting, nutrient uptake, and escape from grazing. Environmental variability and the uneven distribution of resources among and within the different aquatic ecosystems exert a selective pressure on these organisms, which are formed by a single cell or by colonies with either relatively low or high numbers of cells. Phytoplankton displays an amazing morphological variability representing an adaptation to spatial and temporal variability of their environments. Among functional traits of phytoplankton, morphological features such as shape and size represent an unavoidable starting point to fully understand the relationships between this group of organisms and its environment. The molding effect of environmental variables on phytoplankton morphology is particularly evident in highly dynamic environments such as reservoirs or ponds. The analysis of phytoplankton morphology can thus supply important information on the ecological conditions of a given waterbody. To support this hypothesis, data are presented on the main morphological features of phytoplankton from a 20-year limnological investigation carried out in a Mediterranean man-made lake. The results show that phytoplankton morphological variability reflects different environmental scenarios, and that the morphological features of phytoplankton represent a powerful tool to assess the ecological or trophic state of aquatic ecosystems.

AB Our study challenges the functional approach for its usefulness in assessing the consequences of hypoxia disturbance events on macrofaunal communities in the south-western Baltic Sea. Time series for two decades of observations from two monitoring stations, one in the Fehmarnbelt (exposed to aperiodic hypoxia), and another in the Darss Rise (normoxic conditions) is used. Our results designate differences of functional structure of benthic fauna communities between sites based on biological traits that characterise species role in modifying the environment, behavioural strategies, morphology and life history, thus suggesting differences in functioning. Hypoxic years reveal sharp increase of the role of sedentary species, suspension filter feeders, epibenthic structures, globulose form, medium/large size of individuals, preponderance of species with long lifespan (caused for instance by remaining ocean quahog). The link of functional and species diversity to the stagnation periods is proposed for the Darss station that exhibit continuous changes and low temporal variability of traits distribution. Before the major inflow in 1993 the increased role of small size organisms, containing calcium carbonate, filter feeders and grazers, higher presence of semi-pelagic species is observed. The hypoxic events and water renewal processes impact the communities not only in respect to species composition but also functionally. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Idealized equilibrium models have attributed the observed size structure of marine communities to the interactions between nutrient and grazing control. Here, we examine this theory in a more realistic context using a size-structured global ocean food-web model, together with a much simplified version of the same model for which equilibrium solutions are readily obtained. Both models include the same basic assumptions: allometric scaling of physiological traits and size-selective zoo-plankton grazing. According to the equilibrium model, grazing places a limit on the phytoplankton biomass within each size-class, while the supply rate of essential nutrients limits the number of coexisting size classes, and hence the total biomass, in the system. The global model remains highly consistent with this conceptual view in the large-scale, annual average sense, but reveals more complex behaviour at shorter timescales, when phytoplankton and zooplankton growth may become decoupled. In particular, we show temporal and spatial scale dependence between total phytoplankton biomass and two key ecosystem properties: the zooplankton-to-phytoplankton ratio, and the partitioning of biomass among different size classes.

AB The importance of genetic variation in evolution is well established. Yet, the mechanisms by which genetic variation-particularly variation in traits under selection-is maintained in natural populations has long been an evolutionary puzzle. Understanding individual variables driving selection and their functional mechanisms is increasingly important in the context of global change and its potential consequences for biodiversity. Here we examined intra-population performance among allelic variants of a pleiotropic locus in response to thermal stress in the variable platyfish, Xiphophorus variatus. The wild-type tailspot allele exhibited significantly lower heat tolerance than all three pattern alleles found in the population, conforming to predictions based on previously observed correlations between temperature and pattern frequencies in the wild. Furthermore, differences between tailspot pattern frequencies in adults and juveniles were broadly consistent with this trend. Thus, it appears that physiological stress and reduced performance of the wild-type allele at higher relative temperatures is a mechanism balancing its frequency in natural populations. Temperature variation and not dissolved oxygen alone, as previously reported, is likely a important abiotic variable contributing to the maintenance of adaptive polymorphism. Furthermore, our findings underscore the potential implications of rising temperatures and physiological stress for levels of genetic variation in natural populations.

AB The limiting similarity hypothesis predicts that communities should be more resistant to invasion by non-natives when they include natives with a diversity of traits from more than one functional group. In restoration, planting natives with a diversity of traits may result in competition between natives of different functional groups and may influence the efficacy of different seeding and maintenance methods, potentially impacting native establishment. We compare initial establishment and first-year performance of natives and the effectiveness of maintenance techniques in uniform versus mixed functional group plantings. We seeded ruderal herbaceous natives, longer-lived shrubby natives, or a mixture of the two functional groups using drill- and hand-seeding methods. Non-natives were left undisturbed, removed by hand-weeding and mowing, or treated with herbicide to test maintenance methods in a factorial design. Native functional groups had highest establishment, growth, and reproduction when planted alone, and hand-seeding resulted in more natives as well as more of the most common invasive, Brassica nigra. Wick herbicide removed more non-natives and resulted in greater reproduction of natives, while hand-weeding and mowing increased native density. Our results point to the importance of considering competition among native functional groups as well as between natives and invasives in restoration. Interactions among functional groups, seeding methods, and maintenance techniques indicate restoration will be easier to implement when natives with different traits are planted separately.

AB Resprouting of woody species after above-ground damage may help plants to persist longer at a given site and quickly reoccupy disturbed sites, thereby strongly influencing forest dynamics. Resprouting has been discussed from two adaptation perspectives: recovery from damage by catastrophic disturbance and survival in frequently disturbed shaded understorey. However, few studies have comprehensively dealt with both adaptation types to understand resprouting strategies. To understand the adaptive significance of resprouting, we assessed the size dependence of resprouting ability after stem clipping for 24 deciduous broad-leaved species, including shrubs, sub-canopy and canopy trees, in a cool-temperate forest in Japan. The community assembly includes species adapted to past catastrophic disturbances (e.g. fire, logging) and to stable forest with intermittent treefall (currently the dominant disturbance). We correlated resprouting ability with life-history strategies based on demographic parameters and plant functional traits, such as leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf toughness and wood density. All the studied species could resprout in juveniles, and resprouting ability increased as stump size increased. Most sub-canopy and canopy trees lost their ability to resprout after attaining a particular stump size, whereas shrub species retained the ability to resprout throughout their lifetimes. The relative growth rate, LMA and foliar nitrogen did not greatly influence the resprouting ability of a species. In contrast, species with smaller maximum size, lower leaf toughness and lower wood density had better juvenile resprouting ability. This better resprouting ability may have evolved because these characteristics make them more vulnerable to shaded understorey. However, species with larger maximum size and lower leaf toughness retained their ability to resprout to a larger size.Synthesis. A better resprouting ability is related to the ability to survive frequent disturbances, in juveniles, which are characteristics of both forest understorey and frequent fire or drought. To retain resprouting ability until grown seems to be an adaptation to survive infrequent large disturbances. Light-demanding species, which generally have better resprouting ability than shade-tolerants both in juveniles and adults, are adapted to disturbances of various scale and frequency; however, shade-tolerants could survive well in the understorey due to a combination of stronger physical defences and resprouting ability.

AB QuestionHow does the interaction between silicon (Si) and vegetation affect local and global ecological processes, higher levels of ecological organization, and terrestrial- and watershed-scale Si fluxes?
   LocationWe selected several ecosystems throughout the world, from river headwaters to estuaries, being examples of (i) terrestrial vegetation, (ii) aquatic and floodplain vegetation, and (iii) tidal wetland vegetation.
   MethodsWe provide examples of the importance of linking Si use by terrestrial and aquatic vegetation, to larger-scale Si flux consequences towards and through rivers. Cross-disciplinary studies achieve the best understanding of vegetation effects on the global Si cycle, and the role of Si as a plant functional trait.
   ConclusionSi use by plants has not always received the research attention of other elements. Yet, today the importance of Si for plant functioning is slowly becoming better understood. Silicon is a crucial element for many plant species, being important for decomposition processes, plant competitiveness and stress tolerance. The inclusion by vegetation scientists of Si uptake as a plant functional trait is important to assess links between plant physiology, plant distribution and plant tolerance to environmental changes, but also to understand the role of vegetation on Si fluxes through the watershed. However, lack of knowledge regarding the biological control of the Si cycle hinders accurate quantification. Only a concerted effort bringing scientists together from a broad array of disciplines will provide this new direction for research on vegetation-Si cycling.

AB Tree genomics are advancing at an accelerated rate thanks to recent developments in high-throughput next generation sequencing capabilities and novel biostatistical tools. Our ability to understand the wealth and structure of genetic variation in nature, plantations and orchards, as well as the processes of selection, adaptation and speciation will be limited in the future more by conceptual and analytical weaknesses than by the amount of molecular data available. The major facets of tree genomics, structural, functional, comparative, population, landscape and conservation genomics, as well as tree transcriptomics are the focus of this treatise. Reference is made to the state of the art means of surveying tree genomes, such as ETSs and SNPs. The structural aspects of tree genomes, the location and distribution of genes, with a focus on linkage analysis, genome mapping, map construction and the estimation of genome length are discussed. The analysis of functionally important information through functional genomics focuses on methods such as bulk segregant analysis, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and association mapping, in the effort to unravel the relationship of the genotype and the phenotype. Means to implement this knowledge in breeding, such as marker assisted selection (MAS) and genome-wide selection (GWS) are also presented. Moreover, the caveats of these approaches are pinpointed and discussed in an attempt to understand why, despite a wealth of pertinent research, their practical application is still limited. Population and landscape genomics are discussed in light of explaining quantitative and adaptive variation at the gene and molecular level that has so far remained elusive. The use of genome-wide sampling to discern evolutionary processes and the spatially explicit patterns of genomic variation are detailed. A section on perspectives and the future of tree genomics is included as well.

AB Aquatic insects are the dominant taxon group in most freshwater ecosystems. As temperature is the main driver of their life cycle development, metabolic activity, and geographic distribution, these macroinvertebrates are particularly suitable for large scale and comparative studies of freshwater community responses to climate change. A dataset of bio-ecological traits of 1,942 Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa was used to analyze (1) the relationships among traits, (2) the potential vulnerability of EPT species to climate change, and (3) the geographical occurrence patterns of these potentially endangered species at the scale of European ecoregions. By means of a fuzzy correspondence analysis (FCA), two gradients emerged: (1) a longitudinal gradient, describing successive upstream-downstream features, and (2) a biogeographical gradient, separating endemic and micro-endemic species from widely distributed taxa. Moreover, aquatic insects of southern European ecoregions emerged as those most endangered in terms of potential vulnerability to climate change. Comparative multi-taxon studies provide important new insights into freshwater ecosystem functioning and responses to climate change, and could be the first step toward developing integrative monitoring or assessment tools (e.g., trait-based indicators at the species level) by means of non-arbitrary statistical methods.

AB Sprouting is a widespread trait of geographical, ecological and taxonomical scales that allows resource exploitation, space colonization, vegetative reproduction and post-disturbance persistence. It is considered that persistence is the most frequent functional role of sprouting in woody plants. Here we propose that niche differentiation between sprouts and saplings extends the regeneration niche to suboptimal conditions for sexual recruitment. To test this hypothesis, we sampled root suckers (sprouts) and saplings of the long-lived tree species Euczyphia cordziolia Cav, in an even-aged coastal temperate rain forest. Canopy openness was measured over each recruit as a proxy of regeneration niche. Sapling survival was checked after two years. The entire forest canopy openness range was used as an estimation of niche availability. Light and microclimatic conditions were recorded for different canopy openness. Sprouts and saplings occupied a narrow range of the canopy openness near to the closest extreme of the gradient (4.8-14.1%). The distribution of saplings was explained by the lower survival of small saplings under more open canopies, as a consequence of the interactive effect of higher evaporative demand and radiation load in more opened canopies. Although the niches of sexual and vegetative recruits slightly overlapped (31% of the interquartile range on average), sprouts inhabit the more opened sites. Therefore, sprouts extend the regeneration niche to suboptimal conditions for sapling establishment. Our results contribute toward explaining the high colonization ability of E. cordifolia in this kind of forest, whose composition is strongly driven by gap dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Biological traits analysis (BTA) is considered to be a powerful technique for describing the ecological functioning of marine benthic assemblages. This study is the first to apply BTA to assess differences in the traits of benthic faunal assemblages between areas exposed to heavy and light trawling in a major upwelling ecosystem along the west coast of southern Africa. The data were collected from two sampling locations in Namibia and six sampling locations in South Africa. The intensity of trawling varied from area to area. Significant differences in biological traits (BT) were detected between heavily and lightly trawled areas. Weighted infaunal traits showed significant differences between heavily and lightly trawled areas for 17% of the traits investigated, while 24% of epifaunal traits investigated were significantly different between areas of different trawling intensities. This suggests that the measured BTs of the epifauna might be more sensitive to trawling disturbances than BTs of the infauna. The infaunal traits differed significantly between areas with larger or smaller proportions of sand and mud. Nevertheless, more of the significant differences in infaunal BTs were related to variations in trawling intensity than to variations in sediment composition. Significant modifications of BTs are likely to lead to modified functioning of the community and provide more general potential indicators for management than those based on species. The study confirms the need for more basic biological and life history data on macro-benthic invertebrates but nevertheless shows that BTA detected specific features that correlate with trawling intensity and that these features may be important for epifaunal assemblage functioning.

AB In order to identify novel genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of nutritionally important omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, a database search was carried out in the genomes of the unicellular photoautotrophic green alga Ostreococcus RCC809 and cold-water diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus. The search led to the identification of two putative front-end desaturases (6 and 4) from Ostreococcus RCC809 and one 6-elongase from F. cylindrus. Heterologous expression of putative open reading frames (ORFs) in yeast revealed that the encoded enzyme activities efficiently convert their respective substrates: 54.1% conversion of -linolenic acid for 6-desaturase, 15.1% conversion of 22:5n-3 for 4-desaturase and 38.1% conversion of -linolenic acid for 6-elongase. The 6-desaturase from Ostreococcus RCC809 displays a very strong substrate preference resulting in the predominant synthesis of stearidonic acid (C18:4(6,9,12,15)). These data confirm the functional characterization of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic genes from these two species which have until now not been investigated for such activities. The identification of these new genes will also serve to expand the repertoire of activities available for metabolically engineering the omega-3 trait in heterologous hosts as well as providing better insights into the synthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in marine microalgae.

AB AimAlthough invasion has been linked to species losses in native plant communities, it is unclear how invasive species affect other important aspects of native community biodiversity, such as the composition of functional traits or the degree of phylogenetic relatedness. Here, we ask whether declines in taxonomic diversity (TD) associated with the spread of a highly invasive South African species (iceplant) are linked to similar losses in functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD). Motivated by recent advances in coexistence theory, we aim to infer the mechanisms involved in driving the exclusion of native species following invasion.
   LocationCoastal dunes of central Italy.
   MethodsWe sampled 2x2m vegetation plots characterized by varying degrees of abundance of iceplant (Carpobrotus spp.), and combined species occurrence data with life-history trait information and a dated phylogeny of the native species pool. Rao's quadratic entropy index was used to quantify the TD, FD and PD of each plot, which we then related to iceplant abundance via linear models. Finally, to better understand the mechanisms driving changes in diversity, we characterized both species and communities according to phylogenetic relatedness to iceplant and functional strategy.
   ResultsWe found that the negative association between the level of invasion and native community TD is mirrored by quantitatively similar declines in FD, as well as a shift in community phylogenetic structure. These changes appear to result from the selective exclusion of specific functional groups/clades, likely via a combination of niche- and fitness-related processes.
   Main conclusionsWe found that iceplant poses a greater threat to biodiversity than previously understood and that on top of causing declines in species richness invasion may also hamper ecosystem functioning and reduce evolutionary potential. Accounting for FD and PD holds promise for gaining a better understanding of how invasive species alter the structure of native communities.

AB We synthesise a series of independent but integrated studies on the functioning of a mixed Mediterranean oak forest to demonstrate the tree-soil interactions underpinning a positive feedback process that sustains the coexistence of two oak species. The studies focused on the foliar functional traits, plant regeneration patterns, biogeochemical cycles, soil microbial biomass and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal diversity associated with the co-dominant evergreen Quercus suber and deciduous Quercus canariensis in a Mediterranean forest in southern Spain.
   Foliar attributes differed between oak species, with Q canariensis having higher nutrient content and lower carbon to nutrient ratios and leaf mass per area than Q. suber. These attributes reflected their distinct resource use strategies and adaptation to high and low resource-availability environments, respectively. Leaf-fall nutrient concentrations were higher in Q. canariensis than in Q. suber and were correlated with concentrations in the fresh leaves. Leaf-fall nutrient concentrations influenced nutrient return, leaf-fall decay rate and the proportion of nutrients released from decomposing leaf-fall, all of which were higher for Q canariensis than for Q. suber. This generated a differential net nutrient input into the soil that led to increased soil nutrient concentrations under the canopy of Q. canariensis as compared to Q suber. The fraction of slowly decomposing leaf-fall that builds up soil organic matter was higher for Q canariensis, further raising the nutrient and moisture retention of its soils. Differences between species in soil properties disappeared with increasing soil depth, which was consistent with the hypothesised leaf-fall-mediated effect. Tree-species-generated changes in soil properties had further impacts on soil organisms. Soil microbial biomass (Cmic) and nutrients (Nmic, Pmic) were higher under Q. canariensis than under Q sober and were positively related to soil moisture content and substrate availability (particularly soil N). The composition of the ECM fungal community shifted between the two oaks in response to changes in the soil properties, particularly soil Ca and pH. Lower ECM phylogenetic diversity and higher abundance of mycorrhizal species with saprophytic abilities were related to the greater soil fertility under Q. canariensis. Overall, the two oak species generated soil conditions that aligned with their resource-use strategies and would enhance their own competitive capabilities, potentially creating a positive feedback. The two Quercus created soil spatial heterogeneity that could enable their coexistence through spatial niche partitioning. This study demonstrates the critical role of aboveground-belowground interactions underpinning forest community composition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mediterranean climate ecosystems are characterised by frequent fires, but few studies have focused on the effects of fire disturbance on biological communities in streams in these ecosystems. To compare the responses of macroinvertebrate communities to wildfire, eight sites were established and annually sampled for 5 years. Two months after fire, the number and abundance of macroinvertebrate taxa were not significantly different from those in control streams, but their composition and functional attributes had changed. As expected, an increase in r-strategy taxa was observed during the year following fire. Above all, macroinvertebrate assemblages responded more strongly to hydrology (previous spring precipitation) than to fire. Drought was found to be an overriding disturbance factor, but macroinvertebrate assemblages showed high resilience. In a climate change scenario coupled with human demand for water, it will be important to study the effects of drought interacting with other disturbances like wildfire (which is in turn driven by drought).

AB The appropriate level of taxonomic identification, taxonomic sufficiency, for biomonitoring purposes continues to be controversial. Taxonomic sufficiency, however, fails to address the bias created by size-dependent taxonomic identification, which can result in coarse-resolution identification for immature specimens lacking distinguishing characteristics. Our study provides a direct test for this potential systematic bias in biomonitoring data by examining two morphological traits: body size and shape of key organisms (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata) collected from standard aquatic biomonitoring samples. Direct measurement of body size and a geometric morphometric description of body shape provide consistent, quantitative variables to describe the composition of specimens identified at different levels of taxonomic resolution (genus or family). Corroborating our expectations, we observed evidence of systematic size bias in family-level identifications. Specimens that could only reliably be identified to the family level were significantly smaller than specimens identified to the genus level. Qualitative comparisons of shape variation between specimens demonstrated a high degree of variation in specimens identified only at the family level and support the conclusion that specimens identified at the family level possess multiple constituent taxa (genera or species). Thus, size-dependent taxonomy can have negative consequences for the accurate determination of biodiversity and may invalidate common biomonitoring metrics. Improvements to biomonitoring protocols through technological advances, including DNA-based taxonomy to augment specimen identification, should effectively remove the size-bias problem in the long term. In the short-term, recognizing instances of size bias, the degree to which it may impact bioassessment and exploring methods for remediation, including traits-based assessments, can enhance data quality and inferences derived from biomonitoring studies.

AB Deoxygenation has profound effects on marine biota and delivery of ecological functions in benthic systems. Globally, coastal and oceanic hypoxia is rapidly increasing due to anthropogenic activities including climate change and eutrophication. Little is known about the response of marine ecosystems to deoxygenation over long timescales and the consequences this will have for functioning. This study presents results from biological traits analysis (BTA) of 21 time averaged benthic palaeocommunities from the Wessex Basin, Dorset, UK representing 8 million years of fluctuating regional hypoxia during the Kimmeridgian ( 148-155 Ma). BTA assesses ecosystem functioning using biological traits expressed by species and has not previously been applied to palaeocommunity data. The preserved remains of the palaeocommunities contained gastropods, brachiopods, scaphopods, bryozoans, serpulids, hydroids and crustaceans, but were dominated by bivalves. Significant changes in species composition are shown within periods of less intense hypoxia, but during these periods trait composition did not significantly differ implying conservation of ecological function. However, significant changes in functioning occurred between periods of extremely different palaeoredox state. Proportionally more surface living or shallow burrowing species with traits suggestive of opportunists occurred during periods of low oxygen availability. Morphological differences of hypoxic communities included higher relative abundance of organisms with thinner skeletons (< 0.5 mm) composed of less soluble forms of calcite that may be linked to acidity. These changes are similar to those for modern benthos exposed to hypoxia. Investigation of functional changes that occurred during ancient hypoxic events can be used to infer the magnitude, thresholds, and rates of long-term functional change in modern communities. Results from this study suggest that during de-oxygenation delivery of normal benthic functioning will initially be maintained, but will collapse once thresholds are reached. This is consistent with the patterns emerging for contemporary systems where functional collapse is associated with hysteresis and threshold effects.

AB The geological history of the Ponto-Caspian region, with alternating cycles of isolation and reconnection among the three main basins (Black and Azov Seas, and the more distant Caspian Sea) as well as between them and the Mediterranean Sea, profoundly affected the diversification of its aquatic fauna, leading to a high degree of endemism. Two alternative hypotheses on the origin of this amazing biodiversity have been proposed, corresponding to phases of allopatric separation of aquatic fauna among sea basins: a Late Miocene origin (10-6 MYA) vs. a more recent Pleistocene ancestry (<2 MYA). Both hypotheses support a vicariant origin of (1) Black + Azov Sea lineages on the one hand, and (2) Caspian Sea lineages on the other. Here, we present a study on the Ponto-Caspian endemic amphipod Pontogammarus maeoticus. We assessed patterns of divergence based on (a) two mitochondrial and one nuclear gene, and (b) a morphometric analysis of 23 morphological traits in 16 populations from South and West Caspian Sea, South Azov Sea and North-West Black Sea. Genetic data indicate a long and independent evolutionary history, dating back from the late Miocene to early Pleistocene (6.6-1.6 MYA), for an unexpected, major split between (i) a Black Sea clade and (ii) a well-supported clade grouping individuals from the Caspian and Azov Seas. Absence of shared haplotypes argues against either recent or human-mediated exchanges between Caspian and Azov Seas. A mismatch distribution analysis supports more stable population demography in the Caspian than in the Black Sea populations. Morphological divergence largely followed patterns of genetic divergence: our analyses grouped samples according to the basin of origin and corroborated the close phylogenetic affinity between Caspian and Azov Sea lineages. Altogether, our results highlight the necessity of careful (group-specific) evaluation of evolutionary trajectories in marine taxa that should certainly not be inferred from the current geographical proximity of sea basins alone.

AB Till date, morphology in general was characterized qualitatively to support the traditional classification system. This study for the first time uses an integrated approach to explore the appropriateness of traditional classification by superposing quantitative characters on qualitative classification using advanced mathematical techniques. Here, a quantitative method was applied that calculates changes in body shape by digitizing the inferred ecological niche and functional attributes of relevant morphological traits. Subsequently, absolute values were assigned to structural-functional traits of extinct atrypids to determine their taxonomy at a higher resolution. Investigating phenotypic diversity in these once abundant Paleozoic brachiopods from deep time is important for predicting future marine biodiversity of their closest living relatives and in conserving the marine ecosystem at large. Results show taxonomic over-splitting, a possible consequence of qualitative taxonomy. This study highlights the necessity of revisiting prior taxonomy by incorporating quantified traits and elicits the hazards of proposing classification based on qualitative traits alone. Perhaps, this study can be a starting point to improve the biological classification system in places where it must be based on morphology alone.

AB Organic aggregates provide a favorable habitat for aquatic microbes, are efficiently filtered by shellfish, and may play a major role in the dynamics of aquatic pathogens. Quantifying this role requires understanding how pathogen abundance in the water and aggregate size interact to determine the presence and abundance of pathogen cells on individual aggregates. We build upon current understanding of the dynamics of bacteria and bacterial grazers on aggregates to develop a model for the dynamics of a bacterial pathogen species. The model accounts for the importance of stochasticity and the balance between colonization and extinction. Simulation results suggest that while colonization increases linearly with background density and aggregate size, extinction rates are expected to be nonlinear on small aggregates in a low background density of the pathogen. Under these conditions, we predict lower probabilities of pathogen presence and reduced abundance on aggregates compared with predictions based solely on colonization. These results suggest that the importance of aggregates to the dynamics of aquatic bacterial pathogens may be dependent on the interaction between aggregate size and background pathogen density, and that these interactions are strongly influenced by ecological interactions and pathogen traits. The model provides testable predictions and can be a useful tool for exploring how species-specific differences in pathogen traits may alter the effect of aggregates on disease transmission.

AB Macrofauna community interactions with environmental variables in the water column (salinity, temperature, turbidity, transparency, suspended particulate matter, particulate organic matter, chol-oroplastic pigments) and in the sediment (granulometric variables, organic carbon and pigments) were investigated in a coastal area with high land runoff due to riverine and temporary stream discharges (Greece, Aegean Sea, Maliakos Gulf). Samples were taken along a distance-depositional gradient from the river mouth to the open sea at eight stations, at times of different precipitation regime from August 2000 to May 2001. The physical variables, such as transparency and median grain size, generally increased seawards, and parallelled the depositional gradient as opposed to measures of food inputs and hydrodynamic regime. High environmental heterogeneity was observed during peak precipitation. The total number of species increased seawards and from August (122 species) to May (170 species). Maximum abundance also increased from August (4953 m(-2)) to May (10,220 individuals m-2), irrespective of distance from river mouth. Species belonging to different functional groups, as to recolonization, feeding, motility and substrate preferences, coexisted at all times indicating high functional diversity. Nonparametric multivariate regression showed that at times of low, rising and falling precipitation 78 -81% of community variation was explained by environmental variables, indicating that macrofauna distribution and species composition respond to food inputs and sediment characteristics. During peak land runoff the community environment relationship weakened (57% of the variability explained). The diversity of functional traits of the most abundant species indicates that the macrofauna community can absorb the impact of increased turbidity, sedimentation and current-driven dispersion. The study offers baseline information for the integrated coastal zone management in microtidal areas with high land runoff under Mediterranean-type climate conditions. During peak land runoff the community environment relationship weakened (57% of the variability explained) whilst species distribution ranges increased. The study shows that the functional diversity in the study area prior to high discharge period enable macrofauna community to absorb the impact of increased turbidity, sedimentation and current-driven dispersion. The study offers baseline information for the impact of high land runoff in microtidal areas under Mediterranean-type climate conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies of trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) typically focus on effects higher predators have on per capita consumption by intermediate consumers of a third, basal prey resource. TMIIs are usually evidenced by changes in feeding rates of intermediate consumers and/or differences in densities of this third species. However, understanding and predicting effects of TMIIs on population stability of such basal species requires examination of the type and magnitude of the functional responses exhibited towards them. Here, in a marine intertidal system consisting of a higher-order fish predator, the shanny Lipophrys pholis, an intermediate predator, the amphipod Echinogammarus marinus, and a basal prey resource, the isopod Jaera nordmanni, we detected TMIIs, demonstrating the importance of habitat complexity in such interactions, by deriving functional responses and exploring consequences for prey population stability. Echinogammarus marinus reacted to fish predator diet cues by reducing activity, a typical anti-predator response, but did not alter habitat use. Basal prey, Jaera nordmanni, did not respond to fish diet cues with respect to activity, distribution or aggregation behaviour. Echinogammarus marinus exhibited type II functional responses towards J. nordmanni in simple habitat, but type III functional responses in complex habitat. However, while predator cue decreased the magnitude of the type II functional response in simple habitat, it increased the magnitude of the type III functional response in complex habitat. These findings indicate that, in simple habitats, TMIIs may drive down consumption rates within type II responses, however, this interaction may remain de-stabilising for prey populations. Conversely, in complex habitats, TMIIs may strengthen regulatory influences of intermediate consumers on prey populations, whilst potentially maintaining prey population stability. We thus highlight that TMIIs can have unexpected and complex ramifications throughout communities, but can be unravelled by considering effects on intermediate predator functional response types and magnitudes.

AB Climate change-driven stressors threaten the persistence of coral reefs worldwide. Symbiotic relationships between scleractinian corals and photosynthetic endosymbionts (genus Symbiodinium) are the foundation of reef ecosystems, and these associations are differentially impacted by stress. Here, we couple empirical data from the coral reefs of Moorea, French Polynesia, and a network theoretic modeling approach to evaluate how patterns in coral-Symbiodinium associations influence community stability under climate change. To introduce the effect of climate perturbations, we simulate local extinctions' that represent either the loss of coral species or the ability to engage in symbiotic interactions. Community stability is measured by determining the duration and number of species that persist through the simulated extinctions. Our results suggest that four factors greatly increase coral-Symbiodinium community stability in response to global changes: (i) the survival of generalist hosts and symbionts maximizes potential symbiotic unions; (ii) elevated symbiont diversity provides redundant or complementary symbiotic functions; (iii) compatible symbiotic assemblages create the potential for local recolonization; and (iv) the persistence of certain traits associate with symbiotic diversity and redundancy. Symbiodinium may facilitate coral persistence through novel environmental regimes, but this capacity is mediated by symbiotic specificity, association patterns, and the functional performance of the symbionts. Our model-based approach identifies general trends and testable hypotheses in coral-Symbiodinium community responses. Future studies should consider similar methods when community size and/or environmental complexity preclude experimental approaches.

AB Size spectra exhibit common patterns of variation and predictable responses to pressures across ecosystem types, functional guilds and taxonomic groups. Here, we extend the size spectra approach to phytoplankton ecological status assessment in transitional waters by developing, testing and validating a multi-metric index of size spectra sensitivity (ISS-phyto), which integrates size structure metrics with others such as phytoplankton diversity, biomass and sensitivity of size classes to anthropogenic disturbance. The ability of various theoretical models of size spectra sensitivity to discriminate between disturbed and undisturbed ecosystems and levels of anthropogenic stress was evaluated. We used data on phytoplankton samples collected in 14 Mediterranean and Black sea transitional water ecosystems (coastal lagoons) from Italy, Albania, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania, and compared the models' efficiency by looking at their pressure-impact response along salinity and enrichment gradients, the latter quantified as variations in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP). Data from a fifteenth Mediterranean lagoon was used for external validation purposes. Right asymmetric models of size class sensitivity, implying higher sensitivity of smaller cell size classes, were found to contribute to the ISS-phyto multimetric tool more effectively than symmetric and left asymmetric models, distinguishing disturbed from undisturbed lagoons and disturbed from undisturbed stations within the same lagoon. When based on right asymmetric sensitivity models, i.e., those that were most efficient in identifying anthropogenic impacts, ISS-phyto also showed the best fit of pressure-response relationships along the salinity and enrichment gradients; at low to high levels of impact ISS response was driven by size class sensitivity and at very high impacts by phytoplankton biomass. A scheme for the classification of Ecological Quality Status based on ISS-phyto is proposed and validated. The validation procedure found that ISS-phyto is an effective and sensitive monitoring tool, robust, easy to apply and to inter-calibrate among laboratories. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to their important role in the ecosystem and high economic value, there is a need to assess the effect of anthropogenic impacts on marine fish assemblages. However, this can only be achieved if variations due to natural causes are known. Moreover, while most assessment tools rely on functional traits, bottom-up habitat classification frameworks tend to use species composition. The present study proposes an innovative framework to define fish assemblage types through metric pairwise constrained k-means (MPCK-means) clustering of sites based on functional guild categories and univariate metrics, an approach that takes into account within-site variability due to the sampling method and natural causes. This was followed by a label-based ensemble clustering approach, which finds patterns that minimise information loss when integrating clustering results from individual metrics. In order to test the method, fish assemblages on 14 nearshore rocky reefs along the Portuguese coast were sampled. The final typology configuration achieved through ensemble clustering consisted of three assemblage types and maintained an average normalised mutual information of 0.605 with the individual clustering results. Nested PERMANOVA found differences among types and the most variable metrics in the face of natural variation were identified. Ultimately, a k-nearest neighbours classifier is proposed to label new sites, based only on environmental variables that are unlikely to be directly affected by the presence of anthropogenic impacts. Optimal performance for the classification model was achieved with inverse distance-weighted voting of the 4 nearest neighbours with an average classification accuracy of 96.08%.

AB Floodplain waterbodies and their biodiversity are increasingly threatened by human activities. Given the limited resources available to protect them, methods to identify the most valuable areas for biodiversity conservation are urgently needed. In this study, we used freshwater fish assemblages in floodplain waterbodies to propose an innovative method for selecting priority areas based on four aspects of their diversity: taxonomic (i.e. according to species classification), functional (i.e. relationship between species and ecosystem processes), natural heritage (i.e. species threat level), and socio-economic (i.e. species interest to anglers and fishermen) diversity. To quantitatively evaluate those aspects, we selected nine indices derived either from metrics computed at the species level and then combined for each assemblage (species rarity, origin, biodiversity conservation concern, functional uniqueness, functional originality, fishing interest), or from metrics directly computed at the assemblage level (species richness, assemblage rarity, diversity of biological traits). Each of these indices belongs to one of the four aspects of diversity. A synthetic index defined as the sum of the standardized aspects of diversity was used to assess the multi-faceted diversity of fish assemblages. We also investigated whether the two main environmental gradients at the catchment (distance from the sea) and at the floodplain (lateral connectivity of the waterbodies) scales influenced the diversity of fish assemblages, and consequently their potential conservation value. Finally, we propose that the floodplain waterbodies that should be conserved as a priority are those located in the downstream part of the catchment and which have a substantial lateral connectivity with the main channel.

AB Estuarine and coastal ecosystems are productive and functionally diverse areas that provide a wide range of societal benefits. Along with human exploitative uses comes an array of anthropogenic disturbances that can affect ecological integrity, including changes to the composition and resilience of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. To understand the responses of ecological communities to anthropogenic disturbance and to manage and mitigate effects, indices for assessing the ecological integrity of estuarine and coastal waters have proliferated worldwide. Using data from 84 intertidal sites in Auckland, New Zealand, we evaluated the suitability of two widely used measures of ecological integrity that were developed in USA and Europe, respectively: the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) and the AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). We then developed a local index based on macrofaunal traits and verified its utility using independent data from >100 additional sites. The local traits based index (TBI), constructed from the richness of macrofaunal taxa in seven functional groups, responded to changes in sediment mud percentage and heavy metal contaminant concentration gradients below international guidelines. The TBI performed better than the indices developed overseas, probably because they were designed to track organic enrichment and hypoxia, which are not the predominant stressors in New Zealand at present. The TBI successfully tracked the stressors that were the most relevant locally and indicated the relative levels of within-group taxonomic richness at various sites. As within-group richness is a component of functional redundancy and ecological resilience, the TBI offers a trifecta of simplicity, robustness and meaningfulness that will facilitate management.

AB Due to human impact, there is extensive degradation and loss of marine habitats, which calls for measures that incorporate taxonomic as well as functional and trophic aspects of biodiversity. Since such data is less easily quantifiable in nature, the use of habitats as surrogates or proxies for biodiversity is on the rise in marine conservation and management. However, there is a critical gap in knowledge of whether pre-defined habitat units adequately represent the functional and trophic structure of communities. We also lack comparisons of different measures of community structure in terms of both between-(beta) and within-habitat (alpha) variability when accounting for species densities. Thus, we evaluated a priori defined coastal habitats as surrogates for traditional taxonomic, functional and trophic zoobenthic community structure. We focused on four habitats (bare sand, canopy-forming algae, seagrass above-and belowground), all easily delineated in nature and defined through classification systems. We analyzed uni- and multivariate data on species and trait diversity as well as stable isotope ratios of benthic macrofauna. A good fit between habitat types and taxonomic and functional structure was found, although habitats were more similar functionally. This was attributed to within-habitat heterogeneity so when habitat divisions matched the taxonomic structure, only bare sand was functionally distinct. The pre-defined habitats did not meet the variability of trophic structure, which also proved to differentiate on a smaller spatial scale. The quantification of trophic structure using species density only identified an epi- and an infaunal unit. To summarize the results we present a conceptual model illustrating the match between pre-defined habitat types and the taxonomic, functional and trophic community structure. Our results show the importance of including functional and trophic aspects more comprehensively in marine management and spatial planning.

AB The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) seeks to achieve good environmental status, by 2020, for European seas. This study analyses the applicability of a process-driven benthic sedimentary habitat model, to be used in the implementation of the MSFD in relation to biodiversity and seafloor integrity descriptors for sedimentary habitats. Our approach maps the major environmental factors influencing soft-bottom macrobenthic community structure and the life-history traits of species. Among the 16 environmental variables considered, a combination of water depth, mean grain size, a wave-induced sediment resuspension index and annual bottom maximum temperature, are the most significant factors explaining the variability in the structure of benthic communities in the study area. These variables are classified into those representing the 'Disturbance' and 'Scope for Growth' components of the environment. It was observed that the habitat classes defined in the process-driven model reflected different structural and functional characteristics of the benthos. Moreover, benthic community structure anomalies due to human pressures could also be detected within the model produced. Thus, the final process-driven habitat map can be considered as being highly useful for seafloor integrity and biodiversity assessment, within the European MSFD as well as for conservation, environmental status assessment and managing human activities, especially within the marine spatial planning process.

AB As the process of ocean acidification alters seawater carbon chemistry, physiological processes such as skeletal accretion are expected to become more difficult for calcifying organisms. The crustose coralline red algae (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) form an important guild of calcifying primary producers in the temperate Northeast Pacific. The morphology of important ecological traits, namely, skeletal density and thallus thickness near the growing edge, was evaluated in Pseudolithophyllum muricatum (Foslie) Steneck & R.T. Paine, the competitively dominant alga within this guild. P.muricatum shows a morphological response to increased ocean acidification in the temperate Northeast Pacific. Comparing historical (1981-1997) and modern (2012) samples from the field, crust thickness near the growing edge was approximately half as thick in modern samples compared with historical samples, while crust calcite density showed no significant change between the two sample groups. Morphological changes at the growing edge have important consequences for mediating competitive interactions within this guild of algae, and may affect the role of crustose coralline algal beds as hosts to infaunal communities and facilitators of recruitment in many invertebrate and macroalgal species.

AB Phaeobacter inhibens DSM 17395 is a metabolically versatile, secondary metabolite producing and surface colonizing member of the alphaproteobacterial Roseobacter clade. Proteins compartmentalized across the Gram-negative cell envelope are expected to be relevant for the habitat success of P. inhibens DSM 17395. Subcellular fractionation was followed by gel- or nano-LC-based separation of proteins and peptides, respectively. Subsequent MS-based identification of in total 1187 proteins allowed allocation to cytoplasm (303 proteins), cytoplasmic membrane (346), periplasm (325), outer membrane (76), and extracellular milieu (22). Multidimensional scaling was used to visualize the spreading of heuristically allocated proteins across the five different compartments. Experimentally inferred subcellular protein localization was compared with PSORTb prediction of protein secretion and membrane localization. Determined subcellular localizations of identified proteins were interpreted to reconstruct the functional traits of the different cell envelope compartments, in particular protein secretion and sorting, direct effector molecule transit, and cell envelope biogenesis. From a proteogenomic perspective, functional prediction of 74 genes (including 17 coding for proteins of hitherto unknown function) could be refined.

AB Determining the existence of interconnected responses among life-history traits and identifying underlying environmental drivers are recognized as key goals for understanding the basis of phenotypic variability. We studied potentially interconnected responses among senescence, fecundity, embryos size, weight of brooding females, size at maturity and sex ratio in a semiterrestrial amphipod affected by macroscale gradients in beach morphodynamics and salinity. To this end, multiple modelling processes based on generalized additive mixed models were used to deal with the spatio-temporal structure of the data obtained at 10 beaches during 22months. Salinity was the only nexus among life-history traits, suggesting that this physiological stressor influences the energy balance of organisms. Different salinity scenarios determined shifts in the weight of brooding females and size at maturity, having consequences in the number and size of embryos which in turn affected sex determination and sex ratio at the population level. Our work highlights the importance of analysing field data to find the variables and potential mechanisms that define concerted responses among traits, therefore defining life-history strategies.

AB Bioturbation, the biogenic modification of sediments through particle reworking and burrow ventilation, is a key mediator of many important geochemical processes in marine systems. In situ quantification of bioturbation can be achieved in a myriad of ways, requiring expert knowledge, technology, and resources not always available, and not feasible in some settings. Where dedicated research programmes do not exist, a practical alternative is the adoption of a trait-based approach to estimate community bioturbation potential (BPc). This index can be calculated from inventories of species, abundance and biomass data (routinely available for many systems), and a functional classification of organism traits associated with sediment mixing (less available). Presently, however, there is no agreed standard categorization for the reworking mode and mobility of benthic species. Based on information from the literature and expert opinion, we provide a functional classification for 1033 benthic invertebrate species from the northwest European continental shelf, as a tool to enable the standardized calculation of BPc in the region. Future uses of this classification table will increase the comparability and utility of large-scale assessments of ecosystem processes and functioning influenced by bioturbation (e.g., to support legislation). The key strengths, assumptions, and limitations of BPc as a metric are critically reviewed, offering guidelines for its calculation and application.

AB Biogeographical systems can be analyzed as networks of species and geographical units. Within such a biogeographical network, individual species may differ fundamentally in their linkage pattern, and therefore hold different topological roles. To advance our understanding of the relationship between species traits and large-scale species distribution patterns in archipelagos, we use a network approach to classify birds as one of four biogeographical species roles: peripherals, connectors, module hubs, and network hubs. These roles are based upon the position of species within the modular network of islands and species in Wallacea and the West Indies. We test whether species traits - including habitat requirements, altitudinal range-span, feeding guild, trophic level, and body length - correlate with species roles. In both archipelagos, habitat requirements, altitudinal range-span and body length show strong relations to species roles. In particular, species that occupy coastal- and open habitats, as well as habitat generalists, show higher proportions of connectors and network hubs and thus tend to span several biogeographical modules (i.e. subregions). Likewise, large body size and a wide altitudinal range-span are related to a wide distribution on many islands and across several biogeographical modules. On the other hand, species restricted to interior forest are mainly characterized as peripherals and, thus, have narrow and localized distributions within biogeographical modules rather than across the archipelago-wide network. These results suggest that the ecological amplitude of a species is highly related to its geographical distribution within and across bio geographical subregions and furthermore supports the idea that large-scale species distributions relate to distributions at the local community level. We finally discuss how our biogeographical species roles may correspond to the stages of the taxon cycle and other prominent theories of species assembly.

AB Riparian ecosystems support mosaics of terrestrial and aquatic plant species that enhance regional biodiversity and provide important ecosystem services to humans. Species composition and the distribution of functional traits - traits that define species in terms of their ecological roles - within riparian plant communities are rapidly changing in response to various global change drivers. Here, we present a conceptual framework illustrating how changes in dependent wildlife communities and ecosystem processes can be predicted by examining shifts in riparian plant functional trait diversity and redundancy (overlap). Three widespread examples of altered riparian plant composition are: shifts in the dominance of deciduous and coniferous species; increases in drought-tolerant species; and the increasing global distribution of plantation and crop species. Changes in the diversity and distribution of critical plant functional traits influence terrestrial and aquatic food webs, organic matter production and processing, nutrient cycling, water quality, and water availability. Effective conservation efforts and riparian ecosystems management require matching of plant functional trait diversity and redundancy with tolerance to environmental changes in all biomes.

AB Reduction of flow constitutes one of the most severe human alterations to rivers, as it affects the key abiotic feature of these ecosystems. While there has been considerable progress in understanding the effects of reduced flow on benthic macroinvertebrates, cascading effects of flow reduction on dissolved oxygen concentrations (DO) have not yet received much attention. We compared the macroinvertebrate composition between reference conditions and a situation after several years of discharge reduction in the Spree River (Brandenburg, Germany). Community composition shifted from rheophilic species to species indifferent to flow conditions. Filter feeders were partially replaced by collector/gatherers, which likely reduces the retention of organic matter, and thus the self-purification capacity of the river section. These shifts were associated with low discharge during summer, cascading into daily DO concentration minima of less than 5 mg l(-1) which prevailed 74% of the days in summer. This depletion of DO after flow reduction presumably caused the observed species turnover. Hence, flow reduction in lowland rivers may not only directly impair the ecological functions provided by benthic macroinvertebrates but may also act indirectly by depleting DO concentrations.

AB A size and trait-based marine community model was used to investigate interactions, with potential implications for yields, when a fishery targeting forage fish species (whose main adult diet is zooplankton) co-occurs with a fishery targeting larger-sized predator species. Predicted effects on the size structure of the fish community, growth and recruitment of fishes, and yield from the fisheries were used to identify management trade-offs among the different fisheries. Results showed that moderate fishing on forage fishes imposed only small effects on predator fisheries, whereas predator fisheries could enhance yield from forage fisheries under some circumstances.

AB Species richness has dominated our view of global biodiversity patterns for centuries(1,2). The dominance of this paradigm is reflected in the focus by ecologists and conservation managers on richness and associated occurrence-based measures for understanding drivers of broad-scale diversity patterns and as a biological basis for management(3,4). However, this is changing rapidly, as it is now recognized that not only the number of species but the species present, their phenotypes and the number of individuals of each species are critical in determining the nature and strength of the relationships between species diversity and a range of ecological functions (such as biomass production and nutrient cycling)(5). Integrating these measures should provide a more relevant representation of global biodiversity patterns in terms of ecological functions than that provided by simple species counts. Here we provide comparisons of a traditional global biodiversity distribution measure based on richness with metrics that incorporate species abundances and functional traits. We use data from standardized quantitative surveys of 2,473 marine reef fish species at 1,844 sites, spanning 133 degrees of latitude from all ocean basins, to identify new diversity hotspots in some temperate regions and the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. These relate to high diversity of functional traits amongst individuals in the community (calculated using Rao's Q(6)), and differ from previously reported patterns in functional diversity and richness for terrestrial animals, which emphasize species-rich tropical regions only(7,8). There is a global trend for greater evenness in the number of individuals of each species, across the reef fish species observed at sites ('community evenness'), at higher latitudes. This contributes to the distribution of functional diversity hotspots and contrasts with well-known latitudinal gradients in richness(2,4). Our findings suggest that the contribution of species diversity to a range of ecosystem functions varies over large scales, and imply that in tropical regions, which have higher numbers of species, each species contributes proportionally less to community-level ecological processes on average than species in temperate regions. Metrics of ecological function usefully complement metrics of species diversity in conservation management, including when identifying planning priorities and when tracking changes to biodiversity values.

TI Conspecific Plasticity and Invasion: Invasive Populations of Chinese

AB Global climate change may increase biological invasions in part because invasive species may have greater phenotypic plasticity than native species. This may be especially important for abiotic stresses such as salt inundation related to increased hurricane activity or sea level rise. If invasive species indeed have greater plasticity, this may reflect genetic differences between populations in the native and introduced ranges. Here, we examined plasticity of functional and fitness-related traits of Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) populations from the introduced and native ranges that were grown along a gradient of soil salinity (control: 0 ppt; Low: 5 ppt; Medium: 10 ppt; High: 15 ppt) in a greenhouse. We used both norm reaction and plasticity index (PIv) to estimate the conspecific phenotypic plasticity variation between invasive and native populations. Overall, invasive populations had higher phenotypic plasticity of height growth rate (HGR), aboveground biomass, stem biomass and specific leaf area (SLA). The plasticity Index (PIv) of height growth rate (HGR) and SLA each were higher for plants from invasive populations. Absolute performance was always comparable or greater for plants from invasive populations versus native populations with the greatest differences at low stress levels. Our results were consistent with the "Master-of-some" pattern for invasive plants in which the fitness of introduced populations was greater in more benign conditions. This suggests that the greater conspecific phenotypic plasticity of invasive populations compared to native populations may increase invasion success in benign conditions but would not provide a potential interspecific competitive advantage in higher salinity soils that may occur with global climate change in coastal areas.

AB During plant-transpiration, water molecules having the lighter stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen evaporate and diffuse at a faster rate through the stomata than molecules having the beavier isotopes, which cause isotopic enrichment of leaf water. Although previous models have assumed that leaf water is well-mixed and isotopically uniform, non uniform stomatal closure, promoting different enrichments between cells, and different pools of water within leaves, due to morpho-physiological traits, might lead to inaccuracies in isotopic models predicting leaf water enrichment. We evaluate the role of leaf morphophysiological traits on leaf water isotopic enrichment in woody species occurring in a coastal vegetation of Brazil known as restinga. Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope values of soil, plant stem and leaf water and leaf traits were measured in six species from restinga vegetation during a drought and a wet period. Leaf water isotopic enrichment relative to stem water was more homogeneous among species during the drought in contrast to the wet period suggesting convergent responses to deal to temporal heterogeneity in water availability. Average leaf water isotopic enrichment relative to stem water during the drought period was highly correlated with relative apoplastic water content. We discuss this observation in the context of current models of leaf water isotopic enrichment as a function of the Peclet effect. We suggest that future studies should include relative apoplastic water content in isotopic models.

AB Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) is a method for addressing ecological functioning based on traits exhibited by members of biological assemblages. This study explores and compares species and biological trait patterns on either side (landward and seaward) of coastal breakwater structures in northwestern Adriatic Sea (Italy), with the aim of giving insights and knowledge for management of sandy beach systems affected by coastal development. Eight ecological traits of 96 benthic species were considered. Taxon composition evidenced differences in benthic assemblages across time and exposure: landward and seaward communities shared less than 50% of the total number of species. BTA suggested a no-management effect in the functioning of benthic assemblages. Dominant traits modalities were deposit-feeding, short life, small body size, short life span, iteroparity, gonocorism, with plankto-planktotrophic larvae. The results of BTA highlighted similarities and stability in trait composition contrary to species composition, suggesting a possible persistence in benthic functioning despite the occurrence of species replacements. To best of my knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts to investigate the effects of a management measure (submerged shore-parallel barriers with groynes) in a shallow marine system by means of BTA.

AB The effect of sheep grazing on species richness, higher order diversity measures, inequality, species composition, functional diversity and allometric relationships at a coastal dune heathland site was investigated. After a prescribed fire in 2002, the site was divided into two parts, where one of the parts was unmanaged and the other part was fenced and grazed by sheep. Sheep grazing had a positive effect on species richness as well as a significant positive effect on the functional diversity at the coastal dune heathland site. Generally, the cover of dwarf shrubs was negatively affected by grazing, whereas the cover of sedges and grasses was positively affected by grazing. There is a need for comparative investigations of the effect of different management methods not only on floristic biodiversity, but on all relevant kinds of biodiversity as well as on soil structure, soil chemistry and habitat micro- and macrostructure. Consequently, we advocate the initiation of an international systematic investigation of the effect of different management methods.

AB In corals, biocalcification is a major function that may be drastically affected by ocean acidification (OA). Scleractinian corals grow by building up aragonitic exoskeletons that provide support and protection for soft tissues. Although this process has been extensively studied, the molecular basis of biocalcification is poorly understood. Notably lacking is a comprehensive catalog of the skeleton-occluded proteins-the skeletal organic matrix proteins (SOMPs) that are thought to regulate the mineral deposition. Using a combination of proteomics and transcriptomics, we report the first survey of such proteins in the staghorn coral Acropora millepora. The organic matrix (OM) extracted from the coral skeleton was analyzed by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics, enabling the identification of 36 SOMPs. These results provide novel insights into the molecular basis of coral calcification and the macroevolution of metazoan calcifying systems, whereas establishing a platform for studying the impact of OA at molecular level. Besides secreted proteins, extracellular regions of transmembrane proteins are also present, suggesting a close control of aragonite deposition by the calicoblastic epithelium. In addition to the expected SOMPs (Asp/Glu-rich, galaxins), the skeletal repertoire included several proteins containing known extracellular matrix domains. From an evolutionary perspective, the number of coral-specific proteins is low, many SOMPs having counterparts in the noncalcifying cnidarians. Extending the comparison with the skeletal OM proteomes of other metazoans allowed the identification of a pool of functional domains shared between phyla. These data suggest that co-option and domain shuffling may be general mechanisms by which the trait of calcification has evolved.

AB 1. Understanding the functional significance of species interactions in ecosystems has become a major challenge as biodiversity declines rapidly worldwide. Ecosystem consequences arising from the loss of diversity either within trophic levels (horizontal diversity) or across trophic levels (vertical diversity) are well documented. However, simultaneous losses of species at different trophic levels may also result in interactive effects, with potentially complex outcomes for ecosystem functioning.
   2. Because of logistical constraints, the outcomes of such interactions have been difficult to assess in experiments involving large metazoan species. Here, we take advantage of a detritus-based model system to experimentally assess the consequences of biodiversity change within both horizontal and vertical food-web components on leaf-litter decomposition, a fundamental process in a wide range of ecosystems.
   3. Our concurrent manipulation of fungal decomposer diversity (0, 1 or 5 species), detritivore diversity (0, 1 or 3 species), and the presence of predatory fish scent showed that trophic complexity is key to eliciting diversity effects on ecosystem functioning. Specifically, although fungi and detritivores tended to promote decomposition individually, rates were highest in the most complete community where all trophic levels were represented at the highest possible species richness. In part, the effects were trait-mediated, reflected in the contrasting foraging responses of the detritivore species to predator scent.
   4. Our results thus highlight the importance of interactive effects of simultaneous species loss within multiple trophic levels on ecosystem functioning. If a common phenomenon, this outcome suggests that functional ecosystem impairment resulting from widespread biodiversity loss could be more severe than inferred from previous experiments confined to varying diversity within single trophic levels.

AB Taxonomic sufficiency (TS) has been proposed for assessing community composition and environmental impacts as a way to balance the need to indicate the biology of the organisms present with time and effort needed for species identification. TS has been applied most often to marine and freshwater macroinvertebrates, but tests of its usefulness are lacking for other freshwater groups. We analyzed the effects of taxonomic resolution, functional groupings, and data transformation on multivariate community patterns in periphyton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, and fishes, and on the quantification of biodiversity and environmental gradients. The applicability of TS differed strongly among taxonomic groups, depending on the average taxonomic breadth of the species sets. Numerical data resolution had more pronounced effects on community patterns than taxonomic resolution. Richness was strongly affected by data aggregation, but diversity indices were statistically reliable up to order level. Taxonomic aggregation had no significant influence on ability to detect environmental gradients. Functional surrogates based on biological traits, such as feeding type, reproductive strategy, and trophic state, were strongly correlated (r = 0.64-0.85) with taxonomic community composition. However, environmental correlations were generally lower with data aggregated to functional traits rather than to species. TS was universally applicable within taxonomic groups for different habitats in one biogeographic region. Aggregation to family or order was suitable for quantifying biodiversity and environmental gradients, but multivariate community analyses required finer resolution in fishes and macrophytes than in periphyton and macroinvertebrates. Sampling effort in environmental-impact studies and monitoring programs would be better invested in quantitative data and number of spatial and temporal replicates than in taxonomic detail.

AB Aim Develop a biogeographical classification of phytoplankton size distributions for the Atlantic Ocean and predict the global phytoplankton size composition based on prevailing environmental conditions.
   Location Atlantic Ocean and Global Ocean
   Methods Using phytoplankton size composition data, nutrient concentrations (nitrite+nitrate, phosphate, and silicate), irradiance, temperature and zooplankton abundances of the Atlantic Meridional Transect programme, we derived and tested an environmental classification method of phytoplankton size distribution with a k-means clustering technique. We then used principal component and Dirichlet multivariate regression analyses to disentangle the relative influence of different environmental conditions on the phytoplankton size composition. Subsequently, we evaluated different probabilisitic models and selected the most parsimonious one to estimate the global phytoplankton size distributions in the world oceans based on global climatology data of the World Ocean Atlas 2009.
   Results Based only on prevailing environmental conditions and without a priori knowledge concerning, for example, the position of oceanic fronts, the primary productivity, the distribution of organisms or any geographical information, our classification method captures the size structures of phytoplankton communities across the Atlantic. We find a strong influence of temperature and nitrite+nitrate concentration on the prevalence of the different size classes, and we present evidence that both factors may act independently on structuring phytoplankton communities. While at low nitrite+nitrate concentrations temperature has a major structuring impact, at high nitrite+nitrate concentrations its influence is reduced. Finally, we show that the global distribution of phytoplankton community size structure can be predicted by a probabilistic model based only on temperature and nitrite+nitrate.
   Main conclusion The global distribution of phytoplankton community size structure can be predicted with good approximation using a parsimonious probabilistic model forced by only temperature and nitrite+nitrate data.

AB Questions: Is phylogenetic diversity (PD) an accurate surrogate for functional diversity (FD)? How are FD PD correlations affected by the diversity index used, covarying factors and/or the strength of the phylogenetic signal in ecological traits?
   Location: Field study, coastal marsh plain Mekhada, Algeria, complemented by simulated data.
   Methods: FD and PD indicesmight correlate simply because variation in species richness and evenness (referred to as co-factors) influences both FD and PD values. We partition FD and PD indices into components influenced by species richness, evenness and species' (functional and phylogenetic) characteristics. When a simple partition was not found, comparison to nullmodels was used to remove the effects of co-factors. We examined correlations between ten FD and PD indices, among which several were shown to be connected using our mathematical partitioning approach and several were transformed by comparison with null models to control for effects of co-factors. In doing this, FD values were calculated using simulated trait values with varying phylogenetic signal. We then selected a subset of complementary FD and PD indices in exploring the influence of environmental variables on diversity across 75 plant assemblages in Mekhada.
   Results: Altogether, mathematical partitioning and the comparison to null models successfully removed the effects of co-factors when comparing FD and PD. For all indices affected by species richness, FD:PD correlations approached 1, irrespective of the trait evolution model used. In contrast, simulations showed that FD:PD correlations measured with indices unaffected by co-factors decreased when the phylogenetic signal in traits decreased. Applied to plant assemblages in Mekhada, complementary diversity indices showed that, despite significant (but moderate) FD PD correlation, FD but not PD was significantly correlated with themain stress gradient (salinity).
   Conclusions: From both our simulations and analysis of plant community diversity, PD was a poor surrogate for FD. In Mekhada, PD was also less correlated with environmental variables than FD. Species richness was found to be a better surrogate for FD than PD in identifying the ecological processes that distribute species along the salinity gradient.

AB Question: Variability in species function is often studied by using phylogenetic relatedness as a surrogate for functional similarity between species, rather than by measuring functional traits directly. The phylogenetic-based method is far less data-intensive than trait-based methods. However, to what extent community- level variability in species function is driven by phylogenetic history has rarely been explored in terms of composition and diversity. In this paper we test this empirically by asking: do differences in the functional composition and diversity of species assemblages (i.e. plots) along an environmental gradientmirror differences in phylogenetic structure?
   Location: Coastal dune communities of the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy.
   Methods: We calculated fuzzy-weighted mean trait values and the Rao index for dominant species in 405 plots using 16 functional traits that were measured in the field or from other sources. Based on a phylogenetic distance matrix among species obtained froman aged phylogenetic supertree, we appliedmatrix correlation tested against appropriate null models to calculate how much of the plot-to-plot variability in functional composition (measured through fuzzy weighting) and diversity (measured with the Rao index) is predicted by the corresponding phylogeneticmetrics.
   Results: At the species pool level there was evidence for a phylogenetic signal in trait variation. Furthermore, we found that differences in species functional diversity among plots were closely related to their phylogenetic variability, but this was not true for functional composition.
   Conclusions: The results show that even when there is evidence of phylogenetic trait conservatism at the species pool level, phylogeny may be unable to capture all aspects of functional community structure. This emphasizes the need for caution when interpretingmeasures of phylogenetic community structure as proxies of functional community structure.

AB 1. The biogeography of freshwater fish is determined in part by large-scale filters such as phylogenetic history, the spatial arrangement of catchments and environmental variability. Species are filtered from the regional pool if they possess a combination of functional traits enabling them to persist in the local environment. This article aims to quantify the relative importance of these large-scale filters in determining spatial variation in freshwater fish life-history traits and functional trait composition of Australian river basins.
   2. We developed a database of 10 life-history traits for 141 native freshwater fish species and compiled species distribution data for 123 river basins across the Australian continent. In order to partition the variation in the representation of life-history trait into unique and overlapping components, we also quantified the degree of phylogenetic relatedness among species, the geographical arrangement of river basins throughout the landscape and 12 broad-scale environmental factors. We then related life-history trait composition to gradients of environmental variation by constrained multivariate ordination and simple linear regression.
   3. Our explanatory matrices accounted for 86.8% of the total variation in life-history trait composition at the river basin scale, of which 59.4% could be attributed to phylogeny and spatially structured environmental variation. This component represents the overlap among the broad-scale filtering processes of phylogenetic history, spatial autocorrelation and environmental variability in accounting for the distribution of life-history traits across Australian river basins.
   4. Our analysis showed strong associations between suites of life-history traits that define generation time and reproductive output and a strong climate-hydrological gradient across the landscape. We also showed significant correlations between specific environmental variables and a number of key life-history traits that highlight the importance of trait-mediated environmental filters at broad spatial scales.
   5. This study advances our conceptual understanding of broad-scale community assembly theory and has revealed trait-environment relationships at scales relevant to restoration and conservation of aquatic biodiversity. Our study provides greater insight into the determinants of spatial variation in fish species distributions and potentially addresses key scientific challenges, such as understanding how fish communities are assembled, and identifies the potential threats to, and responses of, these communities caused by environmental change.

AB Background: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), a marine mammal species inhabited in the waters of Southeast Asia, South Africa and Australia, has attracted much attention because of the dramatic decline in population size in the past decades, which raises the concern of extinction. So far, this species is poorly characterized at molecular level due to little sequence information available in public databases. Recent advances in large-scale RNA sequencing provide an efficient approach to generate abundant sequences for functional genomic analyses in the species with un-sequenced genomes.
   Principal Findings: We performed a de novo assembly of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin leucocyte transcriptome by Illumina sequencing. 108,751 high quality sequences from 47,840,388 paired-end reads were generated, and 48,868 and 46,587 unigenes were functionally annotated by BLAST search against the NCBI non-redundant and Swiss-Prot protein databases (E-value<10(-5)), respectively. In total, 16,467 unigenes were clustered into 25 functional categories by searching against the COG database, and BLAST2GO search assigned 37,976 unigenes to 61 GO terms. In addition, 36,345 unigenes were grouped into 258 KEGG pathways. We also identified 9,906 simple sequence repeats and 3,681 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms as potential molecular markers in our assembled sequences. A large number of unigenes were predicted to be involved in immune response, and many genes were predicted to be relevant to adaptive evolution and cetacean-specific traits.
   Conclusion: This study represented the first transcriptome analysis of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, an endangered species. The de novo transcriptome analysis of the unique transcripts will provide valuable sequence information for discovery of new genes, characterization of gene expression, investigation of various pathways and adaptive evolution, as well as identification of genetic markers.

AB Oxylipins are low-molecular weight secondary metabolites derived from the incorporation of oxygen into the carbon chains of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Oxylipins are produced in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages where they are involved in a broad spectrum of actions spanning from stress and defense responses, regulation of growth and development, signaling, and innate immunity. We explored the diversity in oxylipin patterns in the marine planktonic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia. This genus includes several species only distinguishable with the aid of molecular markers. Oxylipin profiles of cultured strains were obtained by reverse phase column on a liquid chromatograph equipped with UV photodiode detector and q-ToF mass spectrometer. Lipoxygenase compounds were mapped on phylogenies of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia inferred from the nuclear encoded hyper-variable region of the LSU rDNA and the plastid encoded rbcL. Results showed that the genus Pseudo-nitzschia exhibits a rich and varied lipoxygenase metabolism of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), with a high level of specificity for oxylipin markers that generally corroborated the genotypic delineation, even among genetically closely related cryptic species. These results suggest that oxylipin profiles constitute additional identification tools for Pseudo-nitzschia species providing a functional support to species delineation obtained with molecular markers and morphological traits. The exploration of the diversity, patterns and plasticity of oxylipin production across diatom species and genera will also provide insights on the ecological functions of these secondary metabolites and on the selective pressures driving their diversification.

AB Local adaptation and plasticity pose significant obstacles to predicting plant responses to future climates. Although local adaptation and plasticity in plant functional traits have been documented for many species, less is known about population-level variation in plasticity and whether such variation is driven by adaptation to environmental variation. We examined clinal variation in traits and performance - and plastic responses to environmental change - for the shrub Artemisia californica along a 700km gradient characterized (from south to north) by a fourfold increase in precipitation and a 61% decrease in interannual precipitation variation. Plants cloned from five populations along this gradient were grown for 3years in treatments approximating the precipitation regimes of the north and south range margins. Most traits varying among populations did so clinally; northern populations (vs. southern) had higher water-use efficiencies and lower growth rates, C:N ratios and terpene concentrations. Notably, there was variation in plasticity for plant performance that was strongly correlated with source site interannual precipitation variability. The high-precipitation treatment (vs. low) increased growth and flower production more for plants from southern populations (181% and 279%, respectively) than northern populations (47% and 20%, respectively). Overall, precipitation variability at population source sites predicted 86% and 99% of variation in plasticity in growth and flowering, respectively. These striking, clinal patterns in plant traits and plasticity are indicative of adaptation to both the mean and variability of environmental conditions. Furthermore, our analysis of long-term coastal climate data in turn indicates an increase in interannual precipitation variation consistent with most global change models and, unexpectedly, this increased variation is especially pronounced at historically stable, northern sites. Our findings demonstrate the critical need to integrate fundamental evolutionary processes into global change models, as contemporary patterns of adaptation to environmental clines will mediate future plant responses to projected climate change.

AB The clam Meretrix meretrix is an important commercial bivalve distributed in the coastal areas of South and Southeast Asia. In this study, marker trait association analyses were performed based on the stock materials of M. meretrix with different vibrio-resistance profile obtained by selective breeding. Forty-eight EST-SSR markers were screened and 27 polymorphic SSRs of them were genotyped in the clam stocks with different resistance to Vibrio parahaemolyticus (11-R and 11-S) and to Vibrio harveyi (09-R and 09-C). Allele frequency distributions of the SSRs among different stocks were compared using Pearson's Chi-square test, and three functional EST-SSR markers (MM959, MM4765 and MM8364) were found to be associated with vibrio-resistance trait. The 140-bp allele of MM959 and 128-bp allele of MM4765 had significantly higher frequencies in resistant groups (11-R and 09-R) than in susceptive/control groups (11-S and 09-C) (P < 0.01), which suggested that the clams carrying these two alleles have stronger resistance against vibrio. Clam individuals of 11-S were divided into three subgroups based on the survival time post-challenge, and the multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis showed that clusters generated by genetic similarity revealed by the three SSR markers were consistent with the three subgroups distinctions. The putative functions of contig959, contig4765 and contig8364 also suggested that the three SSR-involved genes might play important roles in immunity of M. meretrix. All these results supported that EST-SSR markers MM959, MM4765 and MM8364 were associated with vibrio-resistance and would be useful for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in M. meretrix genetic breeding.

AB Aim Why are some species geographically restricted? Ecological explanations suggest that endemic species may have restricted distributions because limited phenotypic variability results in narrow niches. However, studying variability of traits independently may not fully explain the interactions within and between complex phenotypes and environments. Here, we hypothesize that endemic species are restricted to a narrow range of habitats due to strong phenotypic integration (i.e. strong correlations among traits), strong environmental integration (i.e. strong correlations among the environments occupied) and strong correlations among trait-environment combinations.
   Location The Kerguelen Islands, sub-Antarctic.
   Methods We measured flowering phenology, multiple morphological characters, and species distribution along three abiotic environmental gradients (elevation, soil moisture and soil salinity) in 14 plant species whose distributions range from strictly endemic to cosmopolitan.
   Results We found that for individual species, trait means and variances were independent of endemism, but that endemics occupied higher and less variable microhabitats. However, phenotypic integration, environmental integration along the three gradients, and the strength of trait-environment correlations all increased with the level of species endemism.
   Main conclusions Higher levels of integration within and between phenotypes and environments are associated with more restricted geographical ranges in the species studied. In endemic species phenotypic integration may explain range contraction during the taxon cycle and reduce the ability to adapt to novel microhabitats formed as a result of environmental change.

AB In the course of re-oligotrophication in Lower Lake Constance, Germany, the tall-growing angiosperm Myriophyllum spicatum has been almost replaced by dense and lower-growing charophytes. We hypothesise that Chara globularis negatively affects the performance of M. spicatum due to density competition and nutrient interference. Intra-and interspecific competition was assessed using a response surface experimental design with different densities of both species in mono and mixed stands in an outdoor mesocosm experiment. After 8 weeks, we measured the growth and various functional traits of both species, including stoichiometry, ash-free dry mass and dry-matter content, and for M. spicatum, additionally chlorophyll content, leaf-mass fraction, formation of autofragments, and root/shoot ratio. With increasing density, C. globularis reduced the growth of M. spicatum much more strongly than that of conspecifics. Increasing density of C. globularis led to a lower chlorophyll a to b ratio and lower nitrogen content based on ash-free dry mass in M. spicatum as well as reduced autofragmentation. Established C. globularis meadows can negatively affect tall-growing angiosperms such as M. spicatum when the environmental conditions, such as low phosphorus availability and high water-clarity, are appropriate. These findings have implications for the management of lakes, specifically those where a nuisance growth of tall macrophytes occurs, e.g. in systems where M. spicatum is invasive.

AB Ecological communities exhibit regular shifts in structure along environmental gradients, but it has proved difficult to dissect the mechanisms by which environmental conditions determine the relative success of species. Functional traits may provide a link between environmental drivers and mechanisms of community membership, but this has not been well tested for phytoplankton, which dominate primary production in many aquatic ecosystems. Here we test whether functional traits of phytoplankton can explain how species respond to gradients of light and phosphorus across U.S. lakes. We find that traits related to light utilization and maximum growth rate can predict species' differential responses to the relative availability of these resources. These results show that laboratory-measured traits are predictive of species' performance under natural conditions, that functional traits provide a mechanistic foundation for community ecology, and that variation in community structure is predictable in spite of the complexity of ecological communities.

AB 1. Species richness of microarthropods in coastal temperate rainforests of western North America is enhanced by the presence of heterogeneous arboreal habitats (moss mats). We studied the relationship between species traits and microclimate as a structuring mechanism for understanding this high diversity.
   2. To examine whether community composition is associated with distinct microclimate zones we used Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling ordination of environmental and community data. To link the traits of arboreal microarthropod species with observed environmental variables we used a trait-based approach of RLQand fourth-corner analysis.
   3. Distinct microclimatic zones were observed in the canopy ecosystem stemming from gradients of moisture, temperature, and climatic stability associated with height in canopy and distance from trunk. Associated with these gradients is the growth and development of epiphytic bryophytes such as moss mats and suspended soils, which in turn, influence canopy microclimates.
   4. Microarthropod fauna displayed a community-level response to microclimate gradients which was mediated and partially explained by a trait-based analysis. A general decline in species richness was associated with harsher microclimate conditions. While many species possessed desiccation resistance traits under low-moisture conditions, we posit that other species were able to persist by compensatory movements at very small spatial scales.
   5. In conclusion this study highlights the importance of environmental buffering associated with greater epiphytic biomass for preserving canopy microarthropod biodiversity, but also how developing an understanding of the species trait distributional shifts can enhance our understanding of communities under different environmental conditions, and for predicting future communities under global environmental change.

AB The relationship between current and potential distribution in 34 main Spanish forest tree species (data from the Third Spanish Forest Inventory) was determined using a Maximum Entropy functional approximation with climatic data as predictive variables. A method for detecting regional species pools at two different scales: biogeoclimatic classes (CLATERES classification), and forest landscape types (WWF classification) has been proposed. Then, the Absence percentage for a species (i.e. the proportion of landscapes types or biogeoclimatic classes in which the species is included in the regional species pool but is actually not present) was determined. Results show higher figures of Potential Species Richness in the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Range, while inland or coastal Mediterranean semiarid landscapes have lower figures. Using a classification based on biogeoclimatic variables (CLATERES) improves precision when estimating Absent Species Richness. Absence percentage is zero or close to zero for five species (Pinus uncinata, Quercus robur, Quercus ilex, Quercus humilis and Juniperus communis), while for other six species (Acer pseudoplatanus, Fraxinus angustifolia, Alnus glutinosa, Populus alba, Sorbus aucuparia and Pinus pinea) the figures are higher than 0.6, which means the species is absent in more than 60 % of the landscapes or biogeoclimatic classes that it could inhabit. The relationships between tree life traits and the absence of species from the ecosystems studied is slight but non-dominant species, species not subjected to forest management, or zonal species are less widely distributed that their climatic potentiality indicates.

AB Anthropogenically induced global climate change has important implications for marine ecosystems with unprecedented ecological and economic consequences. Climate change will include the simultaneous increase of temperature and CO2 concentration in oceans. However, experimental manipulations of these factors at the community scale are rare. In this study, we used an experimental approach in mesocosms to analyse the combined effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on macroalgal assemblages from intertidal rock pools. Our model systems were synthetic assemblages of varying diversity and understory component and canopy species identity. We used assemblages invaded by the non-indigenous canopy forming alga Sargassum muticum and assemblages with the native canopy species Cystoseira tamariscifolia. We examined the effects of both climate change factors on several ecosystem functioning variables (i.e. photosynthetic efficiency, productivity, respiration and biomass) and how these effects could be shaped by the diversity and species identity of assemblages. CO2 alone or in combination with temperature affected the performance of macroalgae at both individual and assemblage level. In particular, high CO2 and high temperature (20 degrees C) drastically reduced the biomass of macroalgal assemblages and affected their productivity and respiration rates. The identity of canopy species also played an important role in shaping assemblage responses, whereas species richness did not seem to affect such responses. Species belonging to the same functional effect group responded differently to the same environmental conditions. Data suggested that assemblages invaded with S. muticum might be more resistant in a future scenario of climate change. Thus, in a future scenario of increasing temperature and CO2 concentration, macroalgal assemblages invaded with canopy-forming species sharing response traits similar to those of S. muticum could be favoured.

AB This article presents a framework to diagnose and predict the effects of chemicals, integrating 2 promising tools to incorporate more ecology into ecological risk assessment, namely traits-based approaches and ecological modeling. Traits-based approaches are used increasingly to derive correlations between the occurrence of species traits and chemical exposure from biological and chemical monitoring data. This assessment can also be used in a diagnostic way, i.e., to identify the chemicals probably posing the highest risks to the aquatic ecosystems. The article also describes how ecological models can be used to explore how traits govern the species-substance interactions and to predict effects at the individual, population, and community and ecosystem level, i.e., from the receptor to the landscape level. This can be done by developing models describing the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of the chemical in the individual, the life-history of species and the connectivity of populations, determining their recovery, and the food web relations at the community and ecosystem level that determine the indirect effects. Special attention is given on how spatial aspects can be included in the ecological risk assessments using ecological models. The components of the framework are introduced and critically discussed. We describe how the different tools and data generated through experimentation (laboratory and semifield) and biomonitoring can be integrated. The article uses examples from the aquatic compartment, but the concepts that are used, and their integration within the framework, can be generalized to other environmental compartments.

AB Prey traits linking consumer diversity to ecosystem function remain poorly understood. On tropical coral reefs, herbivores promote coral dominance by suppressing competing macroalgae, but the roles of herbivore identity and diversity, macroalgal defenses, and their interactions in affecting reef resilience and function are unclear. We studied adjacent pairs of no-take marine reserves and fished areas on reefs in Fiji and found that protected reefs supported 7-17x greater biomass, 2-3x higher species richness of herbivorous fishes, and 3-11x more live coral cover than did fished reefs. In contrast, macroalgae were 27-61x more abundant and 3-4x more species-rich on fished reefs. When we transplanted seven common macroalgae from fished reefs into reserves they were rapidly consumed, suggesting that rates of herbivory (ecosystem functioning) differed inside vs. outside reserves.
   We then video-recorded feeding activity on the same seven macroalgae when transplanted into reserves, and assessed the functional redundancy vs. complementarity of herbivorous fishes consuming these macroalgae. Of 29 species of larger herbivorous fishes on these reefs, only four species accounted for 97% of macroalgal consumption. Two unicornfish consumed a range of brown macroalgae, a parrotfish consumed multiple red algae, and a rabbitfish consumed a green alga, with almost no diet overlap among these groups. The two most chemically rich, allelopathic algae were each consumed by a single, but different, fish species. This striking complementarity resulted from herbivore species differing in their tolerances to macroalgal chemical and structural defenses.
   A model of assemblage diet breadth based on our feeding observations predicted that high browser diversity would be required for effective control of macroalgae on Fijian reefs. In support of this model, we observed strong negative relationships between herbivore diversity and macroalgal abundance and diversity across the six study reefs. Our findings indicate that the total diet breadth of the herbivore community and the probability of all macroalgae being removed from reefs by herbivores increases with increasing herbivore diversity, but that a few critical species drive this relationship. Therefore, interactions between algal defenses and herbivore tolerances create an essential role for consumer diversity in the functioning and resilience of coral reefs.

AB Free-living nematodes are efficiently used as bio-indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in marine ecosystems. Among various criteria, functional traits may represent useful tools for monitoring environmental impact in coastal areas. A study of nematode assemblages was carried out in three locations of the Central Adriatic Sea (Italy), one at the mouth of the Foglia River (Baia Flaminia) and two enclosed in the Monte San Bartolo Natural Park (Monte Brisighella and Fiorenzuola di Focara). Taxonomic composition and the functional traits of the nematode assemblage revealed a possible influence of the organic load of the Foglia River. Biotic data, as well as environmental parameters, suggested a particularly negative impact of the river on the assemblage at Baia Flaminia. Here, the increasing impact of the river led to a rise in the relative abundance of r-strategist genera like Chromadora, Sabatieria and Viscosia. Poor ecological conditions were also present at Brisighella, where the river might exert its influence due to the presence of long shore currents. In contrast, the results revealed that the best ecological quality was at Fiorenzuola di Focara, where the impact of anthropogenic activities was generally irrelevant. This study documents how nematodes can be used as an early warning indicator with which to monitor the health quality of vulnerable littoral areas.

AB Background: The genomic architecture of adaptive traits remains poorly understood in non-model plants. Various approaches can be used to bridge this gap, including the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in pedigrees, and genetic association studies in non-structured populations. Here we present results on the genomic architecture of adaptive traits in black spruce, which is a widely distributed conifer of the North American boreal forest. As an alternative to the usual candidate gene approach, a candidate SNP approach was developed for association testing.
   Results: A genetic map containing 231 gene loci was used to identify QTL that were related to budset timing and to tree height assessed over multiple years and sites. Twenty-two unique genomic regions were identified, including 20 that were related to budset timing and 6 that were related to tree height. From results of outlier detection and bulk segregant analysis for adaptive traits using DNA pool sequencing of 434 genes, 52 candidate SNPs were identified and subsequently tested in genetic association studies for budset timing and tree height assessed over multiple years and sites. A total of 34 (65%) SNPs were significantly associated with budset timing, or tree height, or both. Although the percentages of explained variance (PVE) by individual SNPs were small, several significant SNPs were shared between sites and among years.
   Conclusions: The sharing of genomic regions and significant SNPs between budset timing and tree height indicates pleiotropic effects. Significant QTLs and SNPs differed quite greatly among years, suggesting that different sets of genes for the same characters are involved at different stages in the tree's life history. The functional diversity of genes carrying significant SNPs and low observed PVE further indicated that a large number of polymorphisms are involved in adaptive genetic variation. Accordingly, for undomesticated species such as black spruce with natural populations of large effective size and low linkage disequilibrium, efficient marker systems that are predictive of adaptation should require the survey of large numbers of SNPs. Candidate SNP approaches like the one developed in the present study could contribute to reducing these numbers.

AB Many reef-building corals form symbioses with dinoflagellates from the diverse genus Symbiodinium. There is increasing evidence of functional significance to Symbiodinium diversity, which affects the coral holobiont's response to changing environmental conditions. For example, corals hosting Symbiodinium from the clade D taxon exhibit greater resistance to heat-induced coral bleaching than conspecifics hosting the more common clade C. Yet, the relatively low prevalence of clade D suggests that this trait is not advantageous in non-stressful environments. Thus, clade D may only be able to out-compete other Symbiodinium types within the host habitat when conditions are chronically stressful. Previous studies have observed enhanced photosynthesis and fitness by clade C holobionts at non-stressful temperatures, relative to clade D. Yet, carbon-centered metrics cannot account for enhanced growth rates and patterns of symbiont succession to other genetic types when nitrogen often limits reef productivity. To investigate the metabolic costs of hosting thermally tolerant symbionts, we examined the assimilation and translocation of inorganic N-15 and C-13 in the coral Acropora tenuis experimentally infected with either clade C (sub-type C1) or D Symbiodinium at 28 and 30 degrees C. We show that at 28 degrees C, C1 holobionts acquired 22% more N-15 than clade D. However, at 30 degrees C, C1 symbionts acquired equivalent nitrogen and 16% less carbon than D. We hypothesize that C1 competitively excludes clade D in hospite via enhanced nitrogen acquisition and thus dominates coral populations despite warming oceans.

AB Sandbanks are marine habitats of conservation importance under the EU Habitats Directive. These habitats are becoming subject to impacts of several human activities including fishing, aggregation extraction, and construction of offshore wind farms that may have detrimental effects on their structure and functioning. We characterised and compared the diversity and biological traits of demersal fish and megafaunal invertebrate assemblages inhabiting three sandbanks, one in the vicinity of a small existing wind farm and two which are proposed sites for future wind farm installations. Samples in the vicinity of the offshore wind farm were compared with two control sites on the same sandbank. There were significant differences in mean number of taxa, abundance and structure of assemblages between sandbanks. However, biological traits analyses (BTA) showed no differences in the functional traits of assemblages among sandbanks, suggesting functional redundancy. Despite a significant spatial variation in structure and Shannon diversity of assemblages between sites within sandbanks, fish and megafaunal assemblage did not differ between sites near wind turbines and the controls. The natural spatial variability in the diversity and biological traits of demersal and megafaunal assemblages inhabiting this naturally highly disturbed environment is larger than any changes associated with the presence of the wind turbines. This study provides important baseline data against which potential future impacts of human activities can be tested.

AB Species traits have been identified as a component of biodiversity that is worthy of investigation as a tool for exploring ecological effects of anthropogenic disturbances. We used meta-analysis to show how selected species traits of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera can be used to examine the ecological effects of flow and water-level regulation in freshwater ecosystems used for hydropower generation. We hypothesized that hydrological regulation would favor an opportunistic ecological strategy and bring about increased similarity in species composition across samples. We found higher reproductive capacity, faster life cycles, and a tendency toward a changed composition of functional feeding groups in lotic stonefly assemblages in response to hydrological regulation. However, the effects of hydrological regulation on mayfly species traits and lentic stonefly species traits were limited. We found lower species turnover in mayflies and stoneflies from regulated than from unregulated lotic and lentic sites, a result suggesting selection of a subset of mayflies and stoneflies from the regional species pool by flow and water-level regulation. The limited support for our predictions probably reflects the comparatively low diversity of aquatic insect species in Norwegian freshwater ecosystems for biogeographical and historical reasons, phenotypic plasticity of the insects' life histories and feeding habits, low trait diversity, trade-offs among species traits in a marginal region, restrictions to trait combinations and, perhaps, random extinction of mayflies and stoneflies caused by hydrological regulation. We advocate inclusion of species-trait variables that may affect ecosystem-level ecological processes in environmental assessment studies because a better understanding of trait-mediated ecological functioning should facilitate assessment of the ecological consequences of anthropogenic perturbations of freshwater ecosystems.

AB The use of species traits in basic and applied ecology is expanding rapidly because trait-based approaches hold the promise to increase our mechanistic understanding of biological responses. Such understanding could transform descriptive field studies in community ecology into predictive studies. Currently, however, trait-based approaches often fail to reflect species-environment relationships adequately. The difficulties have been perceived mainly as methodological, but we suggest that the problem is more profound and touches on the fundamentals of ecology and evolution. Selection pressures do not act independently on single traits, but rather, on species whose success in a particular environment is controlled by many interacting traits. Therefore, the adaptive value of a particular trait may differ across species, depending on the other traits possessed by the species and the constraints of its body plan. Because of this context-dependence, trait-based approaches should take into account the way combinations of traits interact and are constrained within a species. We present a new framework in which trade-offs and other interactions between biological traits are taken as a starting point from which to develop a better mechanistic understanding of species occurrences. The framework consists of 4 levels: traits, trait interactions, trait combinations, and life-history strategies, in a hierarchy in which each level provides the building blocks for the next. Researchers can contribute knowledge and insights at each level, and their contributions can be verified or falsified using logic, theory, and empirical data. Such an integrated and transparent framework can help fulfill the promise of traits to transform community ecology into a predictive science.

AB Ocean acidification represents a threat to marine species worldwide, and forecasting the ecological impacts of acidification is a high priority for science, management, and policy. As research on the topic expands at an exponential rate, a comprehensive understanding of the variability in organisms' responses and corresponding levels of certainty is necessary to forecast the ecological effects. Here, we perform the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date by synthesizing the results of 228 studies examining biological responses to ocean acidification. The results reveal decreased survival, calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among taxonomic groups, suggesting there is some predictable trait-based variation in sensitivity, despite the investigation of approximately 100 new species in recent research. The results also reveal an enhanced sensitivity of mollusk larvae, but suggest that an enhanced sensitivity of early life history stages is not universal across all taxonomic groups. In addition, the variability in species' responses is enhanced when they are exposed to acidification in multi-species assemblages, suggesting that it is important to consider indirect effects and exercise caution when forecasting abundance patterns from single-species laboratory experiments. Furthermore, the results suggest that other factors, such as nutritional status or source population, could cause substantial variation in organisms' responses. Last, the results highlight a trend towards enhanced sensitivity to acidification when taxa are concurrently exposed to elevated seawater temperature.

AB Acylated homoserine lactone (AHL)-based quorum sensing (QS) has been reported to be present only in Gram-negative microorganisms. Isolation of a novel Gram-positive microorganism from sea water, capable of producing AHL, is reported here. The isolate (GenBank: JF915892, designated as MPO) belonging to the Exiguobacterium genera is capable of inducing the AHL bioreporters, namely Chromobacterium violaceum CV026, Agrobacterium tumefaceins A136, and E.coli JM 109(psb1075). This inducer is characterized as C3-oxo-octanoyl homoserine lactone (OOHL), and its production reaches a maximum of 15.6gL1, during the stationary growth phase of the organism. MPO extract when exogenously added inhibits the formation of biofilm for the same organism and lowers the extracellular polymeric substances, indicating an AHL-associated phenotypic trait. The isolated sequence of a probable LuxR homolog from MPO (designated as ExgR) shows similar functional domains and contains conserved residues in LuxR from other known bacterial QS LuxR regulators. Also present immediately downstream to ExgR was found a sequence showing homology to known LuxI synthase of Pseudomonas putida. qPCR analysis suggests an increment in exgR mRNA on addition of AHL, further proving the role of ExgR as a QS regulator.

AB "It takes a village to finish (marine) science these days" Paraphrased from Curtis Huttenhower (the Human Microbiome project) The rapidity and complexity of climate change and its potential effects on ocean biota are challenging how ocean scientists conduct research. One way in which we can begin to better tackle these challenges is to conduct community-wide scientific studies. This study provides physiological datasets fundamental to understanding functional responses of phytoplankton growth rates to temperature. While physiological experiments are not new, our experiments were conducted in many laboratories using agreed upon protocols and 25 strains of eukaryotic and prokaryotic phytoplankton isolated across a wide range of marine environments from polar to tropical, and from nearshore waters to the open ocean. This community-wide approach provides both comprehensive and internally consistent datasets produced over considerably shorter time scales than conventional individual and often uncoordinated lab efforts. Such datasets can be used to parameterise global ocean model projections of environmental change and to provide initial insights into the magnitude of regional biogeographic change in ocean biota in the coming decades. Here, we compare our datasets with a compilation of literature data on phytoplankton growth responses to temperature. A comparison with prior published data suggests that the optimal temperatures of individual species and, to a lesser degree, thermal niches were similar across studies. However, a comparison of the maximum growth rate across studies revealed significant departures between this and previously collected datasets, which may be due to differences in the cultured isolates, temporal changes in the clonal isolates in cultures, and/or differences in culture conditions. Such methodological differences mean that using particular trait measurements from the prior literature might introduce unknown errors and bias into modelling projections. Using our community-wide approach we can reduce such protocol-driven variability in culture studies, and can begin to address more complex issues such as the effect of multiple environmental drivers on ocean biota.

AB Metabolic plasticity and functional redundancy are fundamental properties of microbial communities, which shape their response to environmental forcing, and also mediate the relationship between community composition and function. Yet, the actual quantification of these emergent community properties has been elusive, and we thus do not know how they vary across bacterial communities, and their relationship to environmental gradients and to each other. Here we present an experimental framework that allows us to simultaneously quantify metabolic plasticity and functional redundancy in freshwater bacterioplankton communities, and to explore connections that may exists between them. We define metabolic plasticity as the rate of change in single-cell properties (cell wall integrity, cell size, single-cell activity) relative to changes in community composition. Likewise, we define functional redundancy as the rate of change in carbon substrate uptake capacities relative to changes in community composition. We assessed these two key community attributes in transplant experiments where bacterioplankton from various aquatic habitats within the same watershed were transplanted from their original water to waters from other systems that differ in their main resources. Our results show that metabolic plasticity is an intrinsic property of bacterial communities, whereas the expression of functional redundancy appears to be more dependent on environmental factors. Furthermore, there was an overall strong positive relationship between the level of functional redundancy and of metabolic plasticity, suggesting no trade-offs between these community attributes but rather a possible co-selection. The apparent continuum in the expression of both functional redundancy and plasticity among bacterial communities and the link between them, in turn suggest that the link between community diversity and function may also vary along a continuum, from being very tight, to being weak, or absent.

AB Individual metabolism, predator-prey relationships, and the role of biodiversity are major factors underlying the dynamics of food webs and their response to environmental variability. Despite their crucial, complementary and interacting influences, they are usually not considered simultaneously in current marine ecosystem models. In an attempt to fill this gap and determine if these factors and their interaction are sufficient to allow realistic community structure and dynamics to emerge, we formulate a mathematical model of the size-structured dynamics of marine communities which integrates mechanistically individual, population and community levels. The model represents the transfer of energy generated in both time and size by an infinite number of interacting fish species spanning from very small to very large species. It is based on standard individual level assumptions of the Dynamic Energy Budget theory (DEB) as well as important ecological processes such as opportunistic size-based predation and competition for food. Resting on the inter-specific body-size scaling relationships of the DEB theory, the diversity of life-history traits (i.e. biodiversity) is explicitly integrated. The stationary solutions of the model as well as the transient solutions arising when environmental signals (e.g. variability of primary production and temperature) propagate through the ecosystem are studied using numerical simulations. It is shown that in the absence of density-dependent feedback processes, the model exhibits unstable oscillations. Density-dependent schooling probability and schooling-dependent predatory and disease mortalities are proposed to be important stabilizing factors allowing stationary solutions to be reached. At the community level, the shape and slope of the obtained quasi-linear stationary spectrum matches well with empirical studies. When oscillations of primary production are simulated, the model predicts that the variability propagates along the spectrum in a given frequency-dependent size range before decreasing for larger sizes. At the species level, the simulations show that, small, and large species dominate the community successively (small species being more abundant at small sizes and large species being more abundant at large sizes) and that the total biomass of a species decreases with its maximal size which again corroborates empirical studies. Our results indicate that the simultaneous consideration of individual growth and reproduction, size-structured trophic interactions, the diversity of life-history traits and a density-dependent stabilizing process allow realistic community structure and dynamics to emerge without any arbitrary prescription. As a logical consequence of our model construction and a basis for future studies, we define the function 0 as the relative contribution of each species to the total biomass of the ecosystem, for any given size. We argue that this function is a measure of the functional role of biodiversity characterizing the impact of the structure of the community (its species composition) on its function (the relative proportions of losses, dissipation and biological work).

AB Behavioral traits of sperm are adapted to the reproductive strategy that each species employs. In polyandrous species, spermatozoa often form motile clusters, which might be advantageous for competing with sperm from other males [1]. Despite this presumed advantage for reproductive success [2, 3], little is known about how sperm form such functional assemblies. Previously, we reported that males of the coastal squid Loligo bleekeri produce two morphologically different euspermatozoa that are linked to distinctly different mating behaviors [4]. Consort and sneaker males use two distinct insemination sites, one inside and one outside the female's body, respectively. Here, we show that sperm release a self-attracting molecule that causes only sneaker sperm to swarm. We identified CO2 as the sperm chemoattractant and membrane-bound flagellar carbonic anhydrase as its sensor. Downstream signaling results from the generation of extracellular H+, intracellular acidosis, and recovery from acidosis. These signaling events elicit Ca2+-dependent turning behavior, resulting in chemotactic swarming. These results illuminate the bifurcating evolution of sperm underlying the distinct fertilization strategies of this species.

AB Here we describe a new trait-based model for cellular resource allocation that we use to investigate the relative importance of different drivers for small cell size in phytoplankton. Using the model, we show that increased investment in nonscalable structural components with decreasing cell size leads to a trade-off between cell size, nutrient and light affinity, and growth rate. Within the most extreme nutrient-limited, stratified environments, resource competition theory then predicts a trend toward larger minimum cell size with increasing depth. We demonstrate that this explains observed trends using a marine ecosystem model that represents selection and adaptation of a diverse community defined by traits for cell size and subcellular resource allocation. This framework for linking cellular physiology to environmental selection can be used to investigate the adaptive response of the marine microbial community to environmental conditions and the adaptive value of variations in cellular physiology.

AB Insect herbivore-plant associations have been widely explored in the scientific literature over the past decades, but other insect-plant associations have received little focus so far. Tank-bromeliads host a large number of invertebrate species and, even though previous studies showed a strong variation in community composition among tank-bromeliad species, the reasons for this variation are still unclear. In this study, we first examined whether different bromeliad species supports distinct and predictable community compositions and whether such variation was caused by (i) the bromeliad species itself, (ii) to its environment, and/or (iii) the covariance between both. We found that different tank-bromeliad species hosts distinct macroinvertebrate assemblages, but community composition was particularly less predictable in the smaller tank-bromeliads. Aquatic macroinvertebrates were sorted along a gradient of environmental conditions presented by the set of tank-bromeliad species examined, according to their functional and biological traits. The tank-bromeliad species and the environmental conditions within its tanks were strongly related and equally important in structuring these communities. These results suggest that associations between bromeliads and the fauna inhabiting its tanks are likely a result of the environmental characteristics particular to each bromeliad species.

AB Zooplankton are major primary consumers and predators in most aquatic ecosystems. They exhibit tremendous diversity of traits, ecological strategies and, consequently, impacts on other trophic levels and the cycling of materials and energy. An adequate representation of this diversity in community and ecosystem models is necessary to generate realistic predictions on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems but remains extremely challenging. We propose that the use of trait-based approaches is a promising way to reduce complexity while retaining realism in developing novel descriptions of zooplankton in ecosystem models. Characterizing zooplankton traits and trade-offs will also be helpful in understanding the selection pressures and diversity patterns that emerge in different ecosystems along major environmental gradients. Zooplankton traits can be characterized according to their function and type. Some traits, such as body size and motility, transcend several functions and are major determinants of zooplankton ecological strategies. Future developments of trait-based approaches to zooplankton should assemble a comprehensive matrix of key traits for diverse groups and explore it for general patterns; develop novel predictive models that explicitly incorporate traits and associated trade-offs; and utilize these traits to explain and predict zooplankton community structure and dynamics under different environmental conditions, including global change scenarios.

AB Preventing invasion by exotic species is one of the key goals of restoration, and community assembly theory provides testable predictions about native community attributes that will best resist invasion. For instance, resource availability and biotic interactions may represent filters that limit the success of potential invaders. Communities are predicted to resist invasion when they contain native species that are functionally similar to potential invaders; where phenology may be a key functional trait. Nutrient reduction is another common strategy for reducing invasion following native species restoration, because soil nitrogen (N) enrichment often facilitates invasion. Here, we focus on restoring the herbaceous community associated with coastal sage scrub vegetation in Southern California; these communities are often highly invaded, especially by exotic annual grasses that are notoriously challenging for restoration. We created experimental plant communities composed of the same 20 native species, but manipulated functional group abundance (according to growth form, phenology, and N-fixation capacity) and soil N availability. We fertilized to increase N, and added carbon to reduce N via microbial N immobilization. We found that N reduction decreased exotic cover, and the most successful seed mix for reducing exotic abundance varied depending on the invader functional type. For instance, exotic annual grasses were least abundant when the native community was dominated by early active forbs, which matched the phenology of the exotic annual grasses. Our findings show that nutrient availability and the timing of biotic interactions are key filters that can be manipulated in restoration to prevent invasion and maximize native species recovery.

AB The Atlantic Forest domain, one of the 25 world's hotspots for biodiversity, has experienced dramatic changes in its landscape. While the loss of species diversity is well documented, functional diversity has not received the same amount of attention. In this study, we evaluated functional diversity of insects in streams utilizing three indices: functional diversity (FD), functional dispersion (FDis), and functional divergence (FDiv), seeking to understand the roles of three predictor sets in explaining functional patterns: (1) bioclimatic and landscape variables; (2) spatial variables; and (3) local environmental variables. We determined the amount of variation in different measures of functional diversity that was explained by each predictor set and their interplays using variation partitioning. Our study showed that variation in functional diversity is better explained by a set of variables linked to different scales dependent on spatial structures, indicating the importance of landscape and mainly environmental variables in the functional organization of aquatic insect communities, and that the relative importance of predictor sets depends on the indices considered. Variation in FD was better explained by the interplay among the three predictor sets and by local environmental variables, whereas variation in FDis was better explained by spatial variables and by the interplay between environmental and spatial variables. Variation in FDiv was not significantly explained by any predictors. Our study adds more evidence on the harmful effects caused by landscape changes on biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest, suggesting that these effects also influence the functional organization of stream insect communities.

AB In multispecies assemblages, phylogenetic relatedness often predicts total community biomass. In assemblages dominated by a single species, increasing the number of genotypes increases total production, but the role of genetic relatedness is unknown. We used data from three published experiments and a field survey of eelgrass (Zostera marina), a habitat-forming marine angiosperm, to examine the strength and direction of the relationship between genetic relatedness and plant biomass. The genetic relatedness of an assemblage strongly predicted its biomass, more so than the number of genotypes. However, contrary to the pattern observed in multispecies assemblages, maximum biomass occurred in assemblages of more closely related individuals. The mechanisms underlying this pattern remain unclear; however, our data support a role for both trait differentiation and cooperation among kin. Many habitat-forming species interact intensely with conspecifics of varying relatedness; thus, genetic relatedness could influence the functioning of ecosystems dominated by such species.

AB Invasive plants can modify terrestrial habitats and affect the natural faunal composition. In acidic coastal dunes the invasive moss Campylopus introflexus can form dense carpets that largely replace native vegetation. As shown in a previous study, moss invasion affects habitat structure and ground-dwelling arthropod diversity. We suggested that including the functional diversity concept in the analysis of moss invasion impacts may offer further insights. We used pitfall trap data to compare trait composition and functional diversity of spiders and carabids in (a) invaded, moss-rich (C. introflexus) and (b) native, lichen-rich (Cladonia spp.) acidic coastal dunes. Moss invasion induced shifts in the trait values body size and feeding preference (carabids) and hunting mode (spiders): Species were smaller in native sites, and the percentages of web-building spiders and phytophagous beetles were reduced in invaded sites. Furthermore, moss invasion led to a more heterogeneous trait composition for spiders, and changed functional diversity of both arthropod groups, although with the opposite effects: While spiders were functionally more diverse in invaded sites, moss invasion reduced carabid beetles' functional diversity. We also observed changes in the relationship between species richness and functional diversity that indicate a high functional similarity for spiders but a lower one for carabid beetles in native grey dunes. C. introflexus invasion not only alters the arthropod diversity and assemblage structure of endangered acidic coastal dunes but also interferes at a functional level. These results provide further insight into the way plant invasions might alter the structure and function of ecosystems.

AB Alien species are considered one of the prime threats to biodiversity, driving major changes in ecosystem structure and function. Identifying the traits associated with alien introduction has been largely restricted to comparing indigenous and alien species or comparing alien species that differ in abundance or impact. However, a more complete understanding may emerge when the entire pool of potential alien species is used as a control, information that is rarely available. In the eastern Mediterranean, the marine environment is undergoing an unparalleled species composition transformation, as a flood of aliens have entered from the Red Sea following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. In this study, we compile data on species traits, geographical distribution, and environmental affinity of the entire pool of reef-associated fish species in the Red Sea and more generally across the Indo-Pacific. We use this extensive data to identify the prime characteristics separating Red Sea species that have become alien in the Mediterranean from those that have not. We find that alien species occupy a larger range of environments in their native ranges, explaining their ability to colonize the seasonal Mediterranean. Red Sea species that naturally experience high maximum temperatures in their native range have a high probability of becoming alien. Thus, contrary to predictions of an accelerating number of aliens following increased water temperatures, hotter summers in this region may prevent the establishment of many alien species. We further find that ecological trait diversity of alien species is substantially more evenly spaced and more divergent than random samples from the pool of Red Sea species, pointing at additional processes, such as competition, promoting ecological diversity among alien species. We use these results to provide a first quantitative ranking of the potential of Red Sea species to become established in the eastern Mediterranean.

AB Enhancing species resilience to changing environmental conditions is often suggested as a climate change adaptation strategy. To effectively achieve this, it is necessary first to understand the factors that determine species resilience, and their relative importance in shaping the ability of species to adjust to the complexities of environmental change. This is an extremely challenging task because it requires comprehensive information on species traits. We explored the resilience of 58 marine turtle regional management units (RMUs) to climate change, encompassing all seven species of marine turtles worldwide. We used expert opinion from the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group (n=33 respondents) to develop a Resilience Index, which considered qualitative characteristics of each RMU (relative population size, rookery vulnerability, and genetic diversity) and non climate-related threats (fisheries, take, coastal development, and pollution/pathogens). Our expert panel perceived rookery vulnerability (the likelihood of functional rookeries becoming extirpated) and non climate-related threats as having the greatest influence on resilience of RMUs to climate change. We identified the world's 13 least resilient marine turtle RMUs to climate change, which are distributed within all three major ocean basins and include six of the world's seven species of marine turtle. Our study provides the first look at inter- and intra-species variation in resilience to climate change and highlights the need to devise metrics that measure resilience directly. We suggest that this approach can be widely used to help prioritize future actions that increase species resilience to climate change.

AB Although functional trait variability is increasingly used in community ecology, the scale- and size-dependent aspects of trait variation are usually disregarded. Here we quantified the spatial structure of shoot height, branch length, root/shoot ratio and leaf number in a macrophyte species Potamogeton maackianus, and then disentangled the environmental and ontogenetic effects on these traits. Using a hierarchical nested design, we measured the four traits from 681 individuals across five ecological scales: lake, transect, depth stratus, quadrat and individual. A notable high trait variation (coefficient variation: 48-112%) was observed within species. These traits differed in the spatial structure, depending on environmental factors of different scales. Shoot height and branch length were most responsive to lake, transect and depth stratus scales, while root/shoot ratio and leaf number to quadrat and individual scales. The trait variations caused by environment are nearly three times higher than that caused by ontogeny, with ontogenetic variance ranging from 21% (leaf number) to 33% (branch length) of total variance. Remarkably, these traits showed non-negligible ontogenetic variation (0-60%) in each ecological scale, and significant shifts in allometric trajectories at lake and depth stratus scales. Our results highlight that environmental filtering processes can sort individuals within species with traits values adaptive to environmental changes and ontogenetic variation of functional traits was non-negligible across the five ecological scales.

AB Background: Riparian habitats are subjected to frequent inundation (flooding) and are characterised by food webs that exhibit variability in aquatic/terrestrial subsidies across the ecotone. The strength of this subsidy in active riparian floodplains is thought to underpin local biodiversity. Terrestrial invertebrates dominate the fauna, exhibiting traits that allow exploitation of variable aquatic subsidies while reducing inundation pressures, leading to inter-species micro-spatial positioning. The effect these strategies have on prey selection is not known. This study hypothesised that plasticity in prey choice from either aquatic or terrestrial sources is an important trait linked to inundation tolerance and avoidance.
   Method/Principal Findings: We used hydrological, isotopic and habitat analyses to investigate the diet of riparian Coleoptera in relation to inundation risk and relative spatial positioning in the floodplain. The study examined patch scale and longitudinal changes in utilisation of the aquatic subsidy according to species traits. Prey sourced from terrestrial or emerging/stranded aquatic invertebrates varied in relation to traits for inundation avoidance or tolerance strategies. Traits that favoured rapid dispersal corresponded with highest proportions of aquatic prey, with behavioural traits further predicting uptake. Less able dispersers showed minimal use of aquatic subsidy and switched to a terrestrial diet under moderate inundation pressures. All trait groups showed a seasonal shift in diet towards terrestrial prey in the early spring. Prey selection became exaggerated towards aquatic prey in downstream samples.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that partitioning of resources and habitat creates overlapping niches that increase the processing of external subsidies in riparian habitats. By demonstrating functional complexity, this work advances understanding of floodplain ecosystem processes and highlights the importance of hydrological variability. With an increasing interest in reconnecting rivers to their floodplains, these invertebrates represent a key functional element in ensuring that such reconnections have demonstrable ecological value.

AB Understanding how plant trait-species abundance relationships change with a range of single and multivariate environmental properties is crucial for explaining species abundance and rarity. In this study, the abundance of 94 woody plant species was examined and related to 15 plant leaf and wood traits at both local and landscape scales involving 31 plots in subtropical forests in eastern China. Further, plant trait-species abundance relationships were related to a range of single and multivariate (PCA axes) environmental properties such as air humidity, soil moisture content, soil temperature, soil pH, and soil organic matter, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents. At the landscape scale, plant maximum height, and twig and stem wood densities were positively correlated, whereas mean leaf area (MLA), leaf N concentration (LN), and total leaf area per twig size (TLA) were negatively correlated with species abundance. At the plot scale, plant maximum height, leaf and twig dry matter contents, twig and stem wood densities were positively correlated, but MLA, specific leaf area, LN, leaf P concentration and TLA were negatively correlated with species abundance. Plant trait-species abundance relationships shifted over the range of seven single environmental properties and along multivariate environmental axes in a similar way. In conclusion, strong relationships between plant traits and species abundance existed among and within communities. Significant shifts in plant trait-species abundance relationships in a range of environmental properties suggest strong environmental filtering processes that influence species abundance and rarity in the studied subtropical forests.

AB Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane to the atmosphere, but factors controlling methane emissions from wetlands are a major source of uncertainty in greenhouse gas budgets and projections of future climate change. We conducted a controlled outdoor mesocosm experiment to assess the effects of plant community structure (functional group richness and composition) on potential methane production and potential iron reduction in freshwater emergent marshes. Four plant functional groups (facultative annuals, obligate annuals, reeds, and tussocks) were arranged in a full-factorial design and additional mesocosms were assigned as no-plant controls. Soil samples from the top 10 cm were collected three times during the growing season to determine potential methane production and potential iron reduction (in unamended soils and in soils amended with 200 mM formate). These data were compared to soil organic matter, soil pH, and previously published data on above and belowground plant biomass. We found that functional group richness was less important than the presence of specific functional groups (reeds or tussocks) in mediating potential iron reduction. In our mesocosms, where oxidized iron was abundant and electron donors were limiting, iron reducing bacteria outcompeted methanogens, keeping methane production barely detectable in unamended lab incubations. When the possibility of re-oxidizing iron was eliminated via anaerobic incubations and the electron donor limitation was removed by adding formate, potential methane production increased and followed the same patterns as potential iron reduction. Our findings suggest that in the absence of abundant oxidized iron and/or the presence of abundant electron donors, wetlands dominated by either reeds or tussocks may have increased methane production compared to wetlands dominated by annuals. Depending on functional traits such as plant transport and rhizospheric oxygenation capacities, this could potentially lead to increased methane emissions in some wetlands. Additional research examining the role these plant functional groups play in other aspects of methane dynamics will be useful given the importance of methane as a greenhouse gas.

AB Rapid changes in global climate are likely to alter species assemblages and environmental characteristics resulting in novel ecosystems. The ability to predict characteristics of future ecosystems is crucial for environmental planning and the development of effective climate change adaptation strategies. This paper presents an approach for envisioning novel ecosystems in future climates. Focusing on riparian ecosystems, we use qualitative process models to predict likely abiotic and biotic changes in four case study systems: tropical coastal floodplains, temperate streams, high mountain streams and urban riparian zones. We concentrate on functional groups rather than individual species and consider dispersal constraints and the capacity for genetic adaptation. Our scenarios suggest that climatic changes will reduce indigenous diversity, facilitate non-indigenous invasion (especially C4 graminoids), increase fragmentation and result in simplified and less distinctive riparian ecosystems. Compared to models based on biota-environment correlations, process models built on mechanistic understanding (like Bayesian belief networks) are more likely to remain valid under novel climatic conditions. We posit that predictions based on species' functional traits will facilitate regional comparisons and can highlight effects of climate change on ecosystem structure and function. Ecosystems that have experienced similar modification to that expected under climate change (for example, altered flow regimes of regulated rivers) can be used to help inform and evaluate predictions. By manipulating attributes of these system models (for example, magnitude of climatic changes or adaptation strategies used), implications of various scenarios can be assessed and optimal management strategies identified.

AB The dynamics of abiotic and biotic environmental factors, like temperature and predation, can strongly influence the effects of anthropogenic chemical pollutants in natural systems. Responses to toxicants and their interactions with environmental factors can occur at varying temporal scales and at different levels of biological complexity (from cells to organisms, populations, communities and ecosystems). Environmental factors may affect tolerance to toxic pollutants under non-stressful conditions, and cause adverse multiple stressor effects under stressful conditions. Adaptive processes, however, have the potential to either mitigate (by co-tolerance) or increase (due to associated costs) the sensitivity of individuals, populations, and communities to pollutants through selection and evolution of traits (at the individual and population levels) and changes in species composition (at the community level). Responses to such multiple stressor effects on different biological levels and temporal scales are not considered in current risk assessment practices. We suggest that these effects should and can be addressed by: (i) designing ecotoxicological experiments with temporal exposure patterns that accommodate adaptive processes, (ii) using trait-based approaches to assess biological responses and natural selection in an integrated manner, and (iii) using energy allocation models to link responses at different levels of biological organization.

AB The study of asymmetry can provide insights into genetic and environmental influences on organismal development. Directional asymmetry (DA) can be either adaptive or non-adaptive, whereas fluctuating asymmetry (FA) defined as small non-directional departures from symmetry in bilateral traits is thought to be an indicator of genetic or environmental stress experienced during development. Using data from 28 European populations, we assessed the degree of DA and FA in the lateral plates of threespine sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus and surveyed the direction of DA and differences in levels of DA and FA in different habitat types (viz. marine, lake and river populations). DA differed between habitats, with right-biased DA found in the marine populations and no directional bias found in lake and river populations. Differences in DA among habitats may be a by-product of habitat-specific developmental instability resulting in asymmetry, or it may indicate habitat-specific differences in selection against/for symmetry, as has been proposed in previous research of sticklebacks. Also, the presence of FA varied depending upon habitat type, but it also depended on plate morph a variable confounded with the habitat effect. While we cannot rule out factors such as stress as a cause of population differences in FA, it may also simply be a by-product of other evolutionary processes (e.g. lateral plate number reduction) without functional basis.

AB Marine sessile benthic organisms living on hard substrates have evolved a variety of attachment strategies. Rhizotrochus (Scleractinia, Flabellidae) is a representative azooxanthellate solitary scleractinian coral with a wide geographical distribution and unique attachment structures; it firmly attaches to hard substrates using numerous tube-like rootlets, which are extended from a corallum wall, whereas most sessile corals are attached by stereome-reinforced structures at their corallite bases. Detailed morphological and constructional traits of the rootlets themselves, along with their evolutionary significance, have not yet been fully resolved. Growth and developmental processes of spines in Truncatoflabellum and rootlets in Rhizotrochus suggest that these structures are homologous, as they both develop from the growth edges of walls and are formed by transformation of wall structures and their skeletal microstructures possess similar characteristics, such as patterns of rapid accretion and thickening deposits. Taking molecular phylogeny and fossil records of flabellids into consideration, Rhizotrochus evolved from a common free-living ancestor and invaded hard-substrate habitats by exploiting rootlets of spines origin, which were adaptive for soft-substrate environments.

AB Although experiencing strong anthropogenic pressures in many estuaries, the ecology of tidal freshwater areas remains largely undocumented. As part of a restoration project in the freshwater zone of the Schelde estuary (Belgium), a new tidal habitat restoration technique (Controlled Reduced Tide system, CRT) was hypothesised to successfully compensate for the impairment of contemporary habitats. The suitability of this newly-created habitat (CRT) and the estuary was investigated over a period of three years for its macroinvertebrate community development. In both the estuary and the CRT, habitats along a flooding gradient were monitored. Differences between the CRT and reference sites in community functioning were explored according to environmental characteristics and organism biological attributes using the RLQ ordination analysis together with the fourth-corner method. Frequently flooded reference sites exhibited environmental characteristics resulting from a hydrological shear stress. In the CRT, after a rapid removal of the terrestrial fauna at low and mid elevations, the low-energy hydrology led to taxonomic and functional enrichment. The RLQ analysis produced significant environmental filtering of biological attributes mainly related to the terrestrial aquatic transition and to the environmental stressors. This provides an example of life history modification via estuarine ecosystem management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Questions: What are the selective landscapes structuring inter-population variability on the Haida Gwaii archipelago? How much morphological variability is functional given the common potential for stochastic founder effects when new habitats are colonized?
   Organism and sites: Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from 56 isolated watersheds with separate marine ancestry encompassing 102 freshwater localities ranging from large oligotrophic mountain lakes to darkly stained bog lakes and ponds on the Haida Gwaii archipelago, western Canada.
   Field data: Biophysical attributes of the habitat (lake volume, depth, percent light transmission at 400 nm, calcium availability, pH, distance to marine waters, predation regime including puncturing, compression, and grappling species), morphological traits of the fish (body size, body depth, lateral plate number and position, dorsal spine length, pelvic girdle size, ascending process height, cross-sectional diameter, basal and lateral plate structural overlap), and geographical distance between localities. Based on previous surveys in this archipelago, we predicted the greatest expression of post-capture defences in lakes with high water clarity and the greatest reduction in small stained ponds, as this characterizes regular shifts in the predation landscape.
   Analyses: Principal components, univariate linear models, and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) analyses.
   Results: Populations range from 30 to 90 mm in adult male standard length, from full-plated to naked, and from full-spined to un-spined. Again and again, populations converge towards functional multivariate or univariate phenotypes predicted by the biophysical attributes of each habitat, primarily lake volume, aquatic spectra, and predation regime. Across a broad diversity of lake volumes, body size is larger in stained lakes and we hypothesize that this is a defence adaptation for increased burst velocity and rapid access to the aphotic zones near the water surface. Defence armour is well developed in clear lakes, independent of lake volume, and in large stained lakes. Completely plated populations are only found in clear habitats. Reduction in posterior plates is associated with accentuated armour development in the anterior trunk in large lakes where predatory vertebrates are common. Anterior armour, including lateral plates and spines, is progressively reduced towards an unarmoured condition in shallow, stained ponds.
   Conclusion: Threespine stickleback from pristine lakes and ponds on the Haida Gwaii archipelago demonstrate remarkable morphological differentiation among populations associated with habitat differences that is largely consistent with changes in predation regime, potentially mediated through a shift from post-capture to pursuit adaptations. Thus, even if founder effects occur when new populations are colonized, natural selection is a major determinant of morphological evolution.

AB Genomic methodologies applied in evolutionary and fisheries research have been of great benefit to understand the marine ecosystem and the management of natural resources. Although single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are attractive for the study of local adaptation, spatial stock management and traceability, and investigating the effects of fisheries-induced selection, they have rarely been exploited in non-model organisms. This is partly due to difficulties in finding and validating SNPs in species with limited or no genomic resources. Complementary to random genome-scan approaches, a targeted candidate gene approach has the potential to unveil pre-selected functional diversity and provides more in depth information on the action of selection at specific genes. For example genes can be under selective pressure due to climate change and sustained periods of heavy fishing pressure. In this study, we applied a candidate gene approach in sole (Solea solea L.), an important member of the demersal ecosystem. As consumption flatfish it is heavy exploited and has experienced associated life-history changes over the last 60 years. To discover novel genetic polymorphisms in or around genes linked to important life history traits in sole, we screened a total of 76 candidate genes related to growth and maturation using a targeted resequencing approach. We identified in total 86 putative SNPs in 22 genes and validated 29 SNPs using a multiplex single-base extension genotyping assay. We found 22 informative SNPs, of which two represent non-synonymous mutations, potentially of functional relevance. These novel markers should be rapidly and broadly applicable in analyses of natural sole populations, as a measure of the evolutionary signature of overfishing and for initiatives on marker assisted selection.

AB The reference condition approach, advocated by the Water Framework Directive, is the basis of most currently used multimetric indices using functional traits of fish species. The ecological status of streams is assessed by measuring the deviation of the observed trait values from the theoretical values of reference conditions in the absence of anthropogenic disturbances. While reference conditions serve as baselines for ecological assessment, they vary with natural environmental conditions. Therefore, global warming appears to be a major threat to the use of current indices for diagnosing future stream conditions, as climate change is projected to modify assemblage composition, suggesting that the functional structure of fish assemblages will also be affected. The main objectives of this study are to assess the potential effect of climate change on the trait composition of fish assemblages and the consequences for the establishment of reference conditions. The results highlight the relation between environmental, especially climatic, conditions and functional traits and project the effects of climate change on trait composition. Traits based on species intolerance are expected to be most negatively affected by the projected climatic shift. The consequences for the development of multimetric indices based on fish functional traits are discussed.

AB Community dynamics in temporary waters are constrained by the hydroregime (depth, timing, duration, frequency, and predictability of water in an aquatic habitat), which in turn is influenced by climatic patterns and anthropogenic use of water in the landscape. Declining rainfall in regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as southwestern Australia, has decreased the depth and duration of water in temporary wetlands, potentially altering the composition of invertebrate communities. We used a long-term data set (6-25 y) to examine temporal changes in hydroregimes and aquatic invertebrate diversity (based on species presence/absence) at 9 seasonal wetlands. The study wetlands maintained distinctly seasonal hydroregimes, despite declining rainfall and the contraction of wetland hydroperiods. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) indicated that conductivity, NO3-+NO2-, and turbidity were the most important factors explaining the changes in invertebrate community composition over time. Allocation of species into 4 trait-based groups based on their resilience to or resistance of drought and their mode of recolonization of a water body upon rewetting revealed that the fauna is dominated by active dispersers. This result suggests that the proximity of source wetlands from which mobile invertebrate species and vertebrate vectors, such as waterbirds, can recolonize seasonal wetlands is an important factor influencing the invertebrate community response to rewetting. Despite the decline in water availability, we found little evidence of a shift to a more arid-adapted fauna. We suggest that the maintenance of a mosaic of wetlands of varying hydroregimes at the whole-landscape scale will be critical to the future persistence of aquatic invertebrate communities in Mediterranean regions where the frequency and intensity of droughts is predicted to increase.

AB Biodiversity losses over the next century are predicted to result in alterations of ecosystem functions that are on par with other major drivers of global change. Given the seriousness of this issue, there is a need to effectively monitor global biodiversity. Because performing biodiversity censuses of all taxonomic groups is prohibitively costly, indicator groups have been studied to estimate the biodiversity of different taxonomic groups. Quantifying cross-taxon congruence is a method of evaluating the assumption that the diversity of one taxonomic group can be used to predict the diversity of another. To improve the predictive ability of cross-taxon congruence in aquatic ecosystems, we evaluated whether body size, measured as the ratio of average body length between organismal groups, is a significant predictor of their cross-taxon biodiversity congruence. To test this hypothesis, we searched the published literature and screened for studies that used species richness correlations as their metric of cross-taxon congruence. We extracted 96 correlation coefficients from 16 studies, which encompassed 784 inland water bodies. With these correlation coefficients, we conducted a categorical meta-analysis, grouping data based on the body size ratio of organisms. Our results showed that cross-taxon congruence is variable among sites and between different groups (r values ranging between -0.53 to 0.88). In addition, our quantitative meta-analysis demonstrated that organisms most similar in body size showed stronger species richness correlations than organisms which differed increasingly in size (r(adj)(2) = 0.94, p = 0.02). We propose that future studies applying biodiversity indicators in aquatic ecosystems consider functional traits such as body size, so as to increase their success at predicting the biodiversity of taxonomic groups where cost-effective conservation tools are needed.

AB Mesozooplankton is a highly diverse group of organisms ranging from very small to large herbivorous, omnivorous or predatory forms. However, most aquatic ecosystem models typically contain only one or two state variables which represent all mesozooplankton forms and specify their role in marine food webs. We have extended an existing mass-balanced marine ecosystem model to include a wide range of mesozooplankton size-classes and species growing from small to large, and maturing at different size. The model includes a dynamic pool of fish with a fixed mortality rate as a closure term of the model, and mechanistic expressions for fish predation. The zooplankton consumes phytoplankton and smaller zooplankton, and responds adaptively to the instantaneous local rates of growth and predation by migrating towards more profitable habitats. We run the model for long time in a stable and repetitive diel light cycle, and explore the emerging ecosystem structure and complexity. In the stable environment the presence of fish has strong structuring effects over the size-structure of mesozooplankton, but little influence on phytoplankton because the total biomass of mesozooplankton remains relatively stable over the fish cycles. The inclusion of adaptive and flexible behaviour leads to emergent effects of multiple predators; the removal of intra-guild predation among zooplankton result in low fish abundance because zooplankton spend more time in deeper habitats. The model reveals persistent spatial and cascading behavioural interactions and is a step towards a mechanistic and adaptive representation of the upper trophic levels in ecosystem models.

AB We present a new individual-based approach to model populations of largely inhomogeneous densities. By monitoring different populations at a spatial scale which is inversely proportional to the maximum expected concentration, the Scaled Subspaces Method solves the problem of demographic explosion of the most numerous species. It is intuitively similar to the experimental practice of changing the magnification of a microscope depending on the size-class of organisms inspected, and retains the possibility for uniform biological descriptions across scales. We use this method to simulate a pelagic microbial mixotrophic food web, where the most abundant species has population densities up to five orders of magnitude higher than the rarest species. The model generates biologically plausible and highly consistent predictions of biomass distribution across this density spectrum. Individual-based community models are affected by the possibility of artificial extinctions. We discuss theoretically and confirm experimentally this possibility, and show that this problem can be overcome through the use of large populations, genetic mutations, and periodical random reintroduction of lost species or traits. We also show that the proposed individual-based model produces the same solutions as a state-variable model of the same ecological scenario. This indicates that the predictions of the two models are independent of implementation issues, and allows using them interchangeably according to convenience. Overall, the study proves the viability of the Scaled Subspaces Method, and provides useful insights on its functioning and parameterization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Performance of aquatic macrophytes is driven by many environmental factors, and a major challenge is to understand how aquatic macrophyte communities are structured in various environments. In softwater lakes in Western Europe, hydrological state (submersed/emersed), carbon dioxide and ammonium levels and species interactions are considered as driving forces in structuring amphibious plant communities. In this study we aimed at evaluating the relative importance of these factors for four species in a competitive neighbourhood. Softwater lake habitat was simulated during one growing season in laboratory conditions, mimicking water level fluctuation, photoperiod and temperature. Artificial communities consisted of small populations of four softwater macrophyte species: Luronium natans, Baldellia ranunculoides ssp. repens, Eleocharis multicaulis and Hydrocotyle vulgaris. These communities were subjected to two levels of carbon dioxide and ammonium. Additionally, monocultures of Baldellia and Eleocharis were grown at a higher nutrient level combination in order to measure their competitive response in a community. Time (hydrological state) and species identity turned out to be the only consistently significant factors determining community composition. Plant performance was clearly species-dependent, while carbon dioxide and ammonium did not have major effects. The competitive response was significant in both Eleocharis and Baldellia. Competition intensity was highest in the emersed state. Carbon dioxide had a supplementary effect on the within-species performance in Luronium, Baldellia and Eleocharis, with high carbon dioxide level mainly resulting in more flowers and more stolons. Community outcomes and competitive responses in aquatic macrophytes appear difficult to predict, because of mixed life strategies and morphological and functional plasticity. We conclude that hydrological state was the only important environmental factor. The identity of the species that were present-implying species interactions-largely determined community outcome.

AB Pesticides are a major stressor for stream ecosystem health. They enter surface waters from diffuse agricultural sources but also from point sources such as municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, to date, no studies have focused on the ecological effects of pesticide-contaminated WWTP effluent on macroinvertebrate communities. On the basis of governmental monitoring data of 328 sites in Hesse, Germany, we identified insecticidal long-term effects on the structure of the macroinvertebrate community up to 3 km downstream of WWTPs. The effects were quantified using the trait-based SPEAR(pesticides) index, which has been shown to be an effective tool for identifying community effects of pesticide contamination. In addition, based on the German Saprobic Index, we revealed that WWTPs are still an important source of oxygen-depleting organic pollution, despite the extensive technological improvements in wastewater management over several centuries. In general, our findings emphasize the need to take municipal WWTPs into consideration in the management of river basins under the EU Water Framework Directive to achieve good ecological and chemical status for European streams and rivers.

AB Urbanization is a growing threat to ecological communities and has become a leading cause of population extirpations in a wide range of taxa. Because the effects of urbanization are often multifaceted, identifying the pathways through which changes in communities occur has remained a persistent challenge. We draw upon metacommunity theory to evaluate competing explanations for the effects of urbanization, focusing on the relative importance of processes at local (e.g. abiotic and biotic characteristics) and regional (e.g. habitat connectivity and dispersal) scales. Over 4years, we sampled 201 wetlands in the Front Range region of Colorado, which is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the USA. Wetlands embedded within urban areas exhibited significantly lower taxonomic richness and diversity compared to those in agricultural or grassland areas. Relative to grassland wetlands, urban wetlands supported a 60% lower richness of amphibians and aquatic reptiles and a 33% lower richness of aquatic insects, molluscs and crayfish. These patterns were associated with changes in biotic factors (introduced fishes and bullfrogs), abiotic factors (nutrients, conductivity and vegetation) and landscape characteristics (road density and surrounding wetland area). The use of an information-theoretic approach and structural equation modelling suggested that the effects of urbanization on richness were mainly driven by changes in road density. Analyses of community composition indicated that discrete communities formed along the urban systems gradient, such that actively dispersing predators associated more negatively with urban system relative to herbivores with passive dispersal. Synthesis and applications. These results highlight the importance of considering both local and regional factors in addressing conservation-related challenges and underscore the benefits of linking conceptual work on metacommunity theory with applied efforts to mitigate the effects of urbanization.

AB The relationship between habitat complexity and species richness is well established but comparatively little is known about the evolution of morphological diversity in complex habitats. Reefs are structurally complex, highly productive shallow-water marine ecosystems found in tropical (coral reefs) and temperate zones (rocky reefs) that harbor exceptional levels of biodiversity. We investigated whether reef habitats promote the evolution of morphological diversity in the feeding and locomotion systems of grunts (Haemulidae), a group of predominantly nocturnal fishes that live on both temperate and tropical reefs. Using phylogenetic comparative methods and statistical analyses that take into account uncertainty in phylogeny and the evolutionary history of reef living, we demonstrate that rates of morphological evolution are faster in reef-dwelling haemulids. The magnitude of this effect depends on the type of trait; on average, traits involved in the functional systems for prey capture and processing evolve twice as fast on reefs as locomotor traits. This result, along with the observation that haemulids do not exploit unique feeding niches on reefs, suggests that fine-scale trophic niche partitioning and character displacement may be driving higher rates of morphological evolution. Whatever the cause, there is growing evidence that reef habitats stimulate morphological and functional diversification in teleost fishes.

AB 1. Dam presence is commonly associated with strong accumulation of polluted sediments. In spite of this context of multiple stressors, physical effects are often solely considered in the ecological assessment of the dam impacts. 2. We studied four reservoir/downstream reach systems differing in levels of sediment contamination in reservoirs. Using assemblages and biotrait (i.e. ecological or biological attribute) responses of macroinvertebrate communities and leaf litter breakdown, we examined the individual effects and potential interactions between sediment contamination and dam presence along the gradient of ecotoxic pressure. 3. Leaf breakdown rates ranged from 0.0044 degrees per day in the most contaminated reservoir to 0.0120 degrees per day in the reference reservoir. Comparisons of community trait profiles among reservoirs highlighted a gradient of trait responses to sediment contamination. 4. In the absence of toxic contamination, the dam-induced modifications in biotraits of invertebrate assemblages were not related to a reduction of leaf litter breakdown. Conversely, contaminated sediment in reservoir induced strong functional disturbances (i.e. bioecological shifts and reduction of leaf litter breakdown) downstream of dams. 5. Key biotrait categories positively related to leaf litter breakdown rate have been identified. They corresponded mainly to shredders and/or small-sized (<0.5 cm) insects, using aquatic (e.g. crawlers) or aerial (e.g. fliers) active dispersal strategies. In addition, trait categories positively correlated to contamination level have been considered as response traits. They corresponded to large-sized (>4 cm) species, having several generations per year (polyvoltin), using asexual reproduction and/or disseminating by drift (aquatic, passive). 6. In the current context of ecological continuity restoration, this study has identified the risks associated with the presence of historical contamination in the run-of-river reservoirs for downstream ecosystem health.

AB Freshwater ecosystems have been fragmented by the construction of large numbers of dams. In addition to disruption of ecological continuity and physical disturbance downstream, accumulation of large amounts of sediment within run-of-river reservoirs constitutes a latent ecotoxic risk to aquatic communities. To date, run-of-river reservoirs and ecotoxic risks associated with contaminated sediment to the biodiversity and functioning of such systems are little studied. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to describe macroinvertebrate assemblages, and the functioning of these systems, and to propose indicators of sediment contamination to integrate in in-situ risk assessment methodology. To identify specific assemblages of run-of-river reservoirs, we first compared macroinvertebrate assemblages and their biotrait profiles (i.e. from a database of biological and ecological traits) in reservoirs (n = 6) and associated river sites (upstream and downstream of dams). Then, we compared responses of assemblages and biotrait profiles to sediment contamination of the banks and channels of reservoirs to select the most useful spatial scale to identify sediment contamination. Nineteen indicator taxa were observed to be specifically associated with channel habitats of reservoirs. Among these, the abundance of three taxa (Tanypodinae (Diptera), Ephemerella (Ephemeroptera) and Atherix (Diptera)) revealed the effect of metal sediment contamination. "Between-reservoirs" differences in their biotrait profile were found along the contamination gradient, with a shift of communities' composition and functionality, and an increase in functional similarity. Many traits (response traits), for example "maximum size", "transverse distribution", "substrate preferences", "saprobity", "temperature", "resistance forms", and "locomotion", were specifically linked to contamination of sediments by metals. This study indicates how sediment contamination can change the structural and functional composition of run-of-river reservoir assemblages. Indicator taxa and response traits identified in this study could improve current risk assessment methodology and potentially enable prediction of the risks of contaminated sediments stored in reservoirs in downstream ecosystems.

AB Background: Crocodilians exhibit a spectrum of rostral shape from long snouted (longirostrine), through to short snouted (brevirostrine) morphologies. The proportional length of the mandibular symphysis correlates consistently with rostral shape, forming as much as 50% of the mandible's length in longirostrine forms, but 10% in brevirostrine crocodilians. Here we analyse the structural consequences of an elongate mandibular symphysis in relation to feeding behaviours.
   Methods/Principal Findings: Simple beam and high resolution Finite Element (FE) models of seven species of crocodile were analysed under loads simulating biting, shaking and twisting. Using beam theory, we statistically compared multiple hypotheses of which morphological variables should control the biomechanical response. Brevi- and mesorostrine morphologies were found to consistently outperform longirostrine types when subject to equivalent biting, shaking and twisting loads. The best predictors of performance for biting and twisting loads in FE models were overall length and symphyseal length respectively; for shaking loads symphyseal length and a multivariate measurement of shape (PC1 - which is strongly but not exclusively correlated with symphyseal length) were equally good predictors. Linear measurements were better predictors than multivariate measurements of shape in biting and twisting loads. For both biting and shaking loads but not for twisting, simple beam models agree with best performance predictors in FE models.
   Conclusions/Significance: Combining beam and FE modelling allows a priori hypotheses about the importance of morphological traits on biomechanics to be statistically tested. Short mandibular symphyses perform well under loads used for feeding upon large prey, but elongate symphyses incur high strains under equivalent loads, underlining the structural constraints to prey size in the longirostrine morphotype. The biomechanics of the crocodilian mandible are largely consistent with beam theory and can be predicted from simple morphological measurements, suggesting that crocodilians are a useful model for investigating the palaeobiomechanics of other aquatic tetrapods.

AB Coastal sand dune ecosystems are known to be structured by disturbance along coast-to-inland gradients, but little is known about how such patterns might change on exposed islands where environmental gradients vector in multiple directions. We investigated responses in plant assemblages on Sable Island, a long (49 km) and narrow (1.25 km at the centre) mostly vegetated sand bar located 160 km off the east coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. We sampled vegetation composition across the island using a stratified random design to capture a range of environmental predictors potentially associated with substrate conditions and disturbance from coastal processes, as well as grazing by the island's feral horses. We identified 3 different vegetation assemblages using hierarchical cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling that were associated with predictor variables. Distance from shore (both north and south shore) and slope angle were strongly related to both vegetation distribution and community composition. Areas farther from shore (subject to less wind and wave disturbance) contained greater amounts of shrub and heath vegetation. However, all parts of the island contained non-vegetated areas or stress-tolerant plant communities. Patterns of vegetation succession inferred for Sable Island were not linear and are better described as responses to repeated environmental disturbance rather than to a gradual process of soil development and competitive displacement. In addition to highlighting the multi-directional environmental influences on community composition of island systems, our results establish baseline spatial information on vegetation communities necessary for the ecological monitoring of Sable Island as a new National Park Reserve.

AB The life cycle research of the past years has revealed an unexpectedly high diversity of reproduction and survival strategies. Dinoflagellate life cycles often seem to be plastic, i.e. different pathways and mechanisms may be complementary in one and the same species. The diversity of life cycle stages, strategies and regulation mechanisms will have implications for the understanding of ecological processes and functions. Versatility in reproduction and survival strategies will affect genetic diversity patterns and standing genetic variation which are important factors in adaptation to changing conditions and stability against environmental disturbance. Complex regulation mechanisms and multiple cues for life cycle transformations can lead to differences in the magnitude of cyst formation and sedimentation and thereby determine the fate of primary production. Life cycles are an important life history trait of dinofiagellates which, in their versatility and complexity, contribute to the functional diversity that structures and determines the functioning of aquatic systems.

AB Over the last few decades, molecular methods have vastly improved our ability to study the diversity of microbial communities. In molecular diversity surveys, the function of protists is often inferred from phylogeny. Yet these surveys are unable to distinguish between different trophic modes among closely related taxa. Here we present results from a culture-independent study linking bacterivory to the diversity of pelagic protists from 3 depths of a stratified mesotrophic lake. Bacteria were labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and added to lakewater samples; after incubation, total DNA was extracted from filtered samples. Part of the DNA extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-BrdU antibodies, and then both whole DNA and BrdU-labeled samples were analyzed using 454-pyrosequencing of the v9 region of 18S small subunit rRNA gene amplicons. The results show that a different community of protists exists at each depth, with limited overlap of taxonomic composition between depths. The community of BrdU-labeled protists, deemed putative bacterivores, is largely a subset of the community found in the whole DNA samples. Many of these BrdU-labeled taxa are poorly represented in GenBank and thus are probably rarely isolated and/or uncultured species. Several of the taxa identified as bacterivores are also phototrophs, highlighting the important role of mixotrophy among eukaryotic microbes. Definitive identity of functional traits among taxa requires careful experimentation, yet this method allows a first-pass assay of the trophic role of microbial eukaryotes from environmental samples.

AB Ecological theory suggests that in harsh environments major abiotic stress factors may act as environmental filters, thereby reducing the range of possible plant strategies through environmental trait selection. This would lead to functional similarity of species coexisting in hostile environments. To test this prediction, we evaluated six functional leaf traits at three different times of year in five species coexisting in a coastal dune ecosystem. The functional traits examined were associated with water status and light interception and use - two of the most limiting factors that lead to stress in dune systems. Species differed in traits associated with light absorption, namely chlorophyll content, the vigour index NDVI, and the proportion of the light absorbed that is used in photochemistry (as expressed by the effective and maximum quantum yield of PSII and the photochemical reflectance index). For most of the traits, the relative performance of species depended significantly on time. This research revealed a significant divergence in functional traits of coexisting species, which does not conform to findings in other harsh environments where species tend to functional convergence. The data provide experimental support for the hypothesis that there is no single combination of traits for a given environment, but that alternative functional designs of similar fitness may evolve in the same environment as a result of complex interactions and trade-offs among traits. This suggests that factors claimed to promote divergence, such as limiting similarity and disturbance processes, may play an important role in structuring the dune community under study. The high variability in functional traits suggests a significant degree of functional diversity and highlights the importance of preserving the species composition of threatened coastal dune habitats in order to preserve distinctive functional processes that may be unique to the systems.

AB In order to detect shifts in community structure and function associated with global change, the natural background fluctuation in these traits must be known. In a 6 yr study we characterized the composition of young benthic communities at 7 sites along the 300 km coast of the Kiel and Lubeck bights in the German Baltic Sea and we quantified their interannual variability of taxonomic and functional composition.
   Along the salinity gradient from NW to SE, the relative abundance of primary producers decreased while that of heterotrophs increased. Along the same gradient, annual productivity tended to increase. Taxonomic and functional richness were higher in Kiel Bight as compared to Lubeck Bight. With increasing species richness functional group richness showed saturation indicating an increasing functional redundancy in species rich communities.
   While taxonomic fluctuations between years were substantial, functionality of the communities seem preserved in most cases. Environmental conditions potentially driving these fluctuations are winter temperatures and current regimes. We tentatively define a confidence range of natural variability in taxonomic and functional composition a departure from which might help identifying an ongoing regime shift driven by global change. In addition, we propose to use RELATE, a statistical procedure in the PRIMER (Plymouth Routines in Multivariate Ecological Research) package to distinguish directional shifts in time ("signal") from natural temporal fluctuations ("noise").

AB Plesiosaurs were a diverse clade of marine reptiles that spanned nearly three-quarters of the Mesozoic (earliest Jurassic to latest Cretaceous). They exhibit variation in head and neck morphology that presumably relates to functional differences in feeding habits. However, from a biomechanical standpoint, these marine creatures have a cranial organization shared with few reptile clades: the neodiapsid condition. Nevertheless, basic structural features in some derived clades, such as elasmosaurids, remain poorly understood, namely the presence of large supratemporal fenestrae, tall temporal bars, and high parietal crests. These features present biomechanical compromises with paleobiological implications for feeding habits. Here we test specific hypotheses regarding skull structure and mechanics in the elasmosaurid plesiosaur Libonectes morgani from the Late Cretaceous of Texas (USA). Using finite element analysis and loadings based on a detailed reconstruction of adductor chamber musculature, we provide estimates of stress and strain distributions for the Libonectes skull. We also digitally morphed different anatomical variants of the Libonectes skull, in order to assess the role of those traits in skull's mechanical performance (e. g., height of the temporal bar). Our results show that a larger physiological cross-section of the adductor muscles is achieved by an enlarged supratemporal fenestra which although it reduces mechanical performance of the skull, it is offset by increased strength of a taller parietal crest and temporal bar, given the loading is largely symmetrical, the lateral components are offsetting yielding a vertical force vector. This arrangement also increases the length of the adductor musculature and thus the total muscle mass. We propose that the reduced pterygoid flange indicates a diminished role for the pterygoideus muscle, reflecting a shift of the majority of the bite force to the adductor mandibulae externus, pseudotemporalis, and adductor mandibulae posterior muscles. Reduction of the pterygoideus falsifies the dual adductor system hypothesis, in which kinetic inertia and static pressure coexist.

AB The main aim of this study was to compare Grime's strategies in 91 plant taxa occurring from the eastern to the western part of the central Black Sea region of northern Turkey (Samsun). To do this, 45 sample plots were taken from different community types (from swamp forests to halophytic communities), and the strategies of plant species were compared with each other. Many tree and shrub species present in Hac1 Osman Forest, a protected swamp forest, exhibited a purely competitive (C) strategy; some other tree and shrub species exhibited secondary strategies such as competitive/competitive stress-tolerant (C/CS) and competitive/competitive ruderal (C/CR). The ecological features of Hac1 Osman Forest and Galeric Forest are similar, and species of either forest tended to adopt stress-tolerant strategies. Coastal dune species within the study area exhibited transient strategies. Finally, it was evaluated that the CSR classification model can be successfully applied to determine the responses of plant species to changing land use patterns and disturbance factors, even for woody shrub and tree species, although our data were not entirely consistent with Grime's succession theory

AB Otolith back-calculation, an estimation of size and growth at some previous age, is a valuable and widely used method of tracking the traits of surviving individuals. Although numerous back-calculation models have been developed, the accuracy of model prediction is rarely assessed before using a model on wild populations. Using the Atlantic Silverside Menidia menidia, we tested the precision of four commonly used back-calculation models (body proportional hypothesis, modified Fry, biological intercept, and time-varying growth). We calculated the moments of the observed length frequency distribution (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) and compared them with the moments of the back-calculated length frequency distribution predicted by each model. We also compared how the most accurate back-calculation model changed under various scenarios of size-selective mortality and found that bias in back-calculation could not be explained by size-selective mortality. The differences between functional forms over a wide range of fish sizes were slight for the biological intercept and modified Fry models, whereas the time-varying growth and body proportional hypothesis models differed considerably. We found that all models performed well for at least one measure of accuracy. However, the modified Fry model was the most accurate overall when back-calculating to the observed population moments.

AB The present paper examines the functional diversity-environment relation in a placer rich tropical bay. Understanding the environmental variables that determine the biodiversity pattern will help in the effective conservation plans of coastal habitat. However, few studies have been carried out on the biodiversity-environment relation from the diverse tropical coastal ecosystem. The geographic location of Kalbadevi Bay along the west coast of India provides an opportunity to study the functional diversity pattern of macrofauna along an environmental gradient. Additionally, the area is also a potential placer mining site. Seasonal sampling was carried out for macrofauna and environmental variables. Macrofaunal functional diversity showed significant temporal variation related to the environmental parameters. The most important environmental variables were organic matter and sediment texture. Filter feeders dominated during postmonsoon which is a period when the water column is enriched with sinking detritus. The deposit feeders which rapidly ingest the settled detritus and also transport it to deeper sediment for the subsurface deposit feeders dominated during premonsoon. Abundance of carnivores was high during premonsoon, a response to increase in food in terms of deposit feeders. The result thus indicates that the temporal environmental variation influenced the macrofaunal functional diversity pattern in the Kalbadevi Bay.

AB Species-specific traits are relevant to understand variation in the effect of grazers on primary producers and are critical in determining their functional roles as controllers of productivity in marine ecosystems. In intertidal habitats, periphyton, composed of bacteria, cyanophytes, microalgae and early stages of macroalgae, constitutes the main food for many benthic grazers. Using field experiments, we examined the overall effect of grazers and the importance of direct and indirect effects of different grazer species on periphyton composition, richness, diversity and productivity. We manipulated the main grazer species present along Chilean rocky shores, en closing adult individuals of the keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa, the chiton Chiton granosus, the scurrinid limpet Scurria araucana and the pulmonate limpet Siphonaria lessoni. These organisms overlap broadly in diet but exhibit differences in foraging behavior. Differences in the individual effects of grazer species on periphyton productivity, as well as on richness and diversity characterized the assemblage. C. granosus grazing led to lower periphyton productivity, richness and diversity compared with all other grazers, who had positive effects for all variables. Richness and diversity of the major periphyton groups were maximal at intermediate levels of total grazing pressure, highlighting the importance of ecological interactions within the periphyton assemblage. Our results demonstrate the complexity of functional roles and relationships of grazers involved in the control of composition and production of the periphyton assemblage. Given the importance of direct and indirect effects of grazers, understanding species interactions within the microbenthic community can shed light on the mechanisms through which herbivores modify community structure and productivity.

AB In microbial competition theory, the Michaelis-Menten (MM) half-saturation coefficient is often considered to be a trait of an organism defining competitive strength in a trade-off conflict with maximum uptake rate. Theoretical studies have shown that a quadratic model characterizes the uptake rate, and that this model can be approximated by a MM model. Here, we review recent developments in nutrient uptake modeling with particular emphasis on cell size, uptake sites, and molecular diffusion. We quantify the bias of the MM approximation to be up to 50% in some configurations. More importantly, we find no mechanistic foundation for a trade-off conflict between the half-saturation coefficient and the maximum specific uptake rate. Measured MM coefficients need to be interpreted in an extended framework where nutrient uptake is explicitly parameterized in terms of cell size, uptake sites, and molecular diffusion. This provides a richer and more mechanistic picture of the way in which uptake rate varies with traits of the organism and environmental variables. Estimates of these key traits can be obtained from measured properties like affinity, the MM half saturation coefficient, and the maximum uptake rate. Using recent estimates of allometric scaling of MM coefficients, we find that handling time, uptake site density, and specific affinity decrease with cell size. Unlike the half-saturation coefficient, specific affinity is a consistent and meaningful measure of competitive strength of microbes, but it is not in a trade-off conflict with maximum uptake rate if the cell is surrounded by a diffusive boundary layer.

AB We have examined the inter- and intra-group seasonal succession of 113 diatom and dinoflagellate taxa, as surveyed by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) in the North Atlantic, by grouping taxa according to two key functional traits: cell size (mu g C cell(-1)) and trophic strategy (photoautotrophy, mixotrophy, or heterotrophy). Mixotrophic dinoflagellates follow photoautotrophic diatoms but precede their obligate heterotrophic counterparts in the succession because of the relative advantages afforded by photosynthesizing when light and nutrients are available in spring. The mean cell size of the sampled diatoms is smallest in the summer, likely because of the higher specific nutrient affinity of smaller relative to larger cells. Contrastingly, we hypothesize that mixotrophy diminishes the size selection based on nutrient limitation and accounts for the lack of a seasonal size shift among surveyed dinoflagellates. Relatively small, heterotrophic dinoflagellates (mu g C cell(-1) < 10(-3)) peak after other, larger dinoflagellates, in part because of the increased abundance of their small prey during nutrient-deplete summer months. The largest surveyed diatoms (mu g C cell(-1) > 10(-2)) bloom later than others, and we hypothesize that this may be because of their relatively slow maximum potential growth rates and high internal nutrient storage, as well as to the slower predation of these larger cells. The new trait database and analysis presented here helps translate the taxonomic information of the CPR survey into metrics that can be directly compared with trait-based models.

AB Mechanistic models such as those based on dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory are emergent ecomechanics tools to investigate the extent of fitness in organisms through changes in life history traits as explained by bioenergetic principles. The rapid growth in interest around this approach originates from the mechanistic characteristics of DEB, which are based on a number of rules dictating the use of mass and energy flow through organisms. One apparent bottleneck in DEB applications comes from the estimations of DEB parameters which are based on mathematical and statistical methods (covariation method). The parameterisation process begins with the knowledge of some functional traits of a target organism (e. g. embryo, sexual maturity and ultimate body size, feeding and assimilation rates, maintenance costs), identified from the literature or laboratory experiments. However, considering the prominent role of the mechanistic approach in ecology, the reduction of possible uncertainties is an important objective. We propose a revaluation of the laboratory procedures commonly used in ecological studies to estimate DEB parameters in marine bivalves. Our experimental organism was Brachidontes pharaonis. We supported our proposal with a validation exercise which compared life history traits as obtained by DEBs (implemented with parameters obtained using classical laboratory methods) with the actual set of species traits obtained in the field. Correspondence between the 2 approaches was very high (>95%) with respect to estimating both size and fitness. Our results demonstrate a good agreement between field data and model output for the effect of temperature and food density on age-size curve, maximum body size and total gamete production per life span. The mechanistic approach is a promising method of providing accurate predictions in a world that is under in creasing anthropogenic pressure.

TI Functional traits explain phytoplankton community structure and seasonal
   dynamics in a marine ecosystem
SO ECOLOGY LETTERS
DT Article
DE Marine; microbial; multilevel; hierarchical models; trait-based ecology
AB A fundamental yet elusive goal of ecology is to predict the structure of communities from the environmental conditions they experience. Trait-based approaches to terrestrial plant communities have shown that functional traits can help reveal the mechanisms underlying community assembly, but such approaches have not been tested on the microbes that dominate ecosystem processes in the ocean. Here, we test whether functional traits can explain community responses to seasonal environmental fluctuation, using a time series of the phytoplankton of the English Channel. We show that interspecific variation in response to major limiting resources, light and nitrate, can be well-predicted by lab-measured traits characterising light utilisation, nitrate utilisation and maximum growth rate. As these relationships were predicted a priori, using independently measured traits, our results show that functional traits provide a strong mechanistic foundation for understanding the structure and dynamics of ecological communities.

AB Silicon is described as beneficial for grasses by enhancing yield and fitness via a considerable contribution to pathogen, drought, and pest resistance. Silicic acid is the predominant form for uptake and transport within the plant and will precipitate in leaves. But it is unknown whether polymeric nanosilicon compounds in its synthetic form, with an increasing concentration in aquatic environments, can be suitable for plant nutrition. Therefore, we investigated the uptake, transport, and deposition of silicic acid/silica within plants using synthetic nanosilica. Our results show a significant difference in silicon (Si) content within the different tissues of Phragmites australis. The nanosilica had been dissolved prior to the uptake by plants. The chemical form of Si during uptake was not traceable. A significant enhancement in the condensation state of the silica was found from root to leaves especially from culm to leaf tips visible by the increasing content of Q(4)-groups in the NMR spectra. We conclude that synthetic nanosilica has the same quality as source for the beneficial element Si like natural silica. Since the condensation state is described to control silica solubility, we suggest that different condensation states within the plant may result in different remobilization of silicon during decomposition of the plant material.

AB There is a recognized need to design a new framework for sediment toxicity testing that meets current scientific standards and regulatory requirements, such as reliable assessment of toxicity, which prevents any harmful effects on biodiversity, a strong capability to predict population- and community-level effects, and applicability of the results to decision-making. We propose a new framework for prospective sediment toxicity testing, and suggest solutions to the key methodological challenges that hinder establishment of this framework (comparison of sensitivities, design of test batteries, consideration of different exposure routes, extrapolations to population and community levels, use of test results for decision-making). The proposed framework consists of the following three units: test-battery system, higher-tier testing systems and additional ecological modeling, and a decision support system. The key methodologies proposed to establish this framework are compound-tailored test-battery use approach, relative sensitivity distribution analysis, toxicity tests that combine bacteria and arthropods, micro- and mesocosms studies, population and community models, and model-driven decision support systems. The proposed framework, as well as the key methods mentioned above, has the potential to improve not only prospective toxicity testing for sediments, but also ecological risk assessment in general.

AB The geometric shape is traditionally used to calculate phytoplankton cell measurements (e.g. biovolume), but it can also play an important role in determining community distributions. Little is known about how geometric shapes relate to other morphological traits or to the environment. We explored whether shapes and related morphological traits are selected by environmental forcing. For this, samples were collected seasonally at 21 stations in coastal-marine waters of the Salento Peninsula (Italy). Phytoplankton taxa were classified in terms of geometric shape, biovolume (organism size) and surface-to-volume ratio (S:V). The relationship between greatest axial linear dimension (GALD) and S:V was assessed for each shape. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was performed to evaluate phytoplankton shape distribution on temporal and spatial scales. Phytoplankton community was characterized by high morphological diversity. GALD and S:V were inversely related in most of the shapes. CCA showed that phytoplankton shape distribution was influenced more by seasonal than by spatial variation: elongated shapes characterized the cold period; rounded and combined shapes the warmer period. Most of the shapes showed conservatism of the S:V and trade-off with the size. Geometric shapes represent an interesting feature to be considered in trait-based approaches to study phytoplankton distributions in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Determining the sustainability of fishing mortality for discards requires information on discard amounts as well as capture and release mortality rates. Formal estimates of these rates are costly and only available for a limited number of species and fisheries. In their absence, proxies for discard mortality could inform risk assessments of fishing mortality sustainability for discarded species. Here, time-to-mortality (TM) was assessed for 48 marine fish species exposed to air following capture during an annual multi-species bottom-trawl survey. Species-specific estimates of TM were related qualitatively to more formal estimates of discard mortality from commercial fisheries, confirming the use of TM as a proxy. The effects on TM of species and individual traits, phylogenetic similarity (proxy for traits not explicitly included in the analysis) and environmental factors related to capture were also assessed. Much of the observed individual variability was explained by intraspecific and interspecific positive relationships between body size and TM. Sedentary species and those lacking a gas bladder or deciduous scales had greater TM. Effects of phylogeny and capture depth and temperature were also found. This study demonstrates how reliable proxies of discard mortality rate can be readily obtained in the field or estimated from relevant covariates.

AB Biovolume is commonly used as a size descriptor in the study of phytoplankton ecology. Usually, biovolume is not measured directly but is obtained from a standardized set of geometric models based on linear dimensions measured by light microscopy. This commonly used method allows visualization and measurement in two dimensions (2D) yielding no information at all on the third dimension of phytoplankton cells. Inaccurate biovolume assessment resulting from geometric approximation leads to erroneous interpretation of eco-physiological processes and morpho-functional traits. Here, we use confocal microscopy coupled with an image analysis system (NIS Elements AR software, Nikon) to determine directly shape and biovolume by means a 3D reconstruction of Coscinodiscus cf. granii specimens. We evaluate the accuracy of current methods by comparing the results obtained using geometric models with direct biovolume and shape. We find that calculation of biovolume by approximation to geometric models (cylindrical and complex shapes) leads to a significant overestimation with respect to direct volume. We also propose a data-driven formula for calculating the biovolume of Coscinodiscus cf. granii specimens based on diameter or other linear measurements.

AB The Antarctic marine environment is extreme in its low temperatures and short periods of primary productivity. Invertebrates must therefore adapt to maximise reproductive output where low temperature and limited food slow larval development. Brooding is a common reproductive trait in Antarctic marine bivalves; larval development occurs within the mantle cavity, and larvae are released as fully developed young. Lissarca miliaris is a small, short-lived, shallow-water brooding bivalve of circum-Antarctic distribution and found most abundant in the sub-Antarctic Magellan Region and islands of the Scotia Arc. Here, an unusual hermaphrodite reproductive trait is described for L. miliaris from King George Island (62A degrees 14'S, 58A degrees 38'W) and Signy Island (60A degrees 42'S, 45A degrees 36'W), Antarctica, using histological and dissection techniques. Specimens demonstrate simultaneous and sequential hermaphrodite traits; male and female gonads develop simultaneously, but the production of oocytes is reduced while testes are ripe. Functional females are more abundant in specimens above 3 mm shell length, although male reproductive tissue persists and functional males are found in all size classes. The number of previtellogenic oocytes produced by far exceeds the number of oocytes extruded and brooded, which may indicate an ancestral link to a planktotrophic past. Hermaphroditism in L. miliaris maximises reproductive efficiency in a short-lived species, in which the female's capacity to brood its young is limited, and demonstrates a specialised adaptation to a cold stenothermal and food-limited environment prevailing in the Southern Ocean.

AB DNA content and cell volume have both been hypothesized as controls on metabolic rate and other physiological traits. We use cultures of two cryptic species of Ditylum brightwellii (West) Grunow with an approximately two-fold difference in genome size and a small and large culture of each clone obtained by isolating small and large cells to compare the physiological consequences of size changes due to differences in DNA content and reduction in cell size following many generations of asexual reproduction. We quantified the growth rate, the functional absorption cross-section of photosystem II (PSII), susceptibility of PSII to photoinactivation, PSII repair capacity, and PSII reaction center proteins D1 (PsbA) and D2 (PsbD) for each culture at a range of irradiances. The species with the smaller genome has a higher growth rate and, when acclimated to growth-limiting irradiance, has higher PSII repair rate capacity, PSII functional optical absorption cross-section, and PsbA per unit protein, relative to the species with the larger genome. By contrast, cell division rates vary little within clonal cultures of the same species despite significant differences in average cell volume. Given the similarity in cell division rates within species, larger cells within species have a higher demand for biosynthetic reductant. As a consequence, larger cells within species have higher numbers of PSII per unit protein (PsbA), since PSII photochemically generates the reductant to support biosynthesis. These results suggest that DNA content, as opposed to cell volume, has a key role in setting the differences in maximum growth rate across diatom species of different size while PSII content and related photophysiological traits are influenced by both growth rate and cell size.

AB Perennial pans are a common feature of the Mpumalanga Highveld in South Africa and are increasingly under threat from mining and agricultural activities. Pans are endorheic wetlands that can be perennial or ephemeral in nature. They are widespread in arid and semi-arid regions throughout the world. Although phyllopod crustaceans dominate pan communities in arid regions, the invertebrate communities of perennial pans have not been well studied. The aim of the current research was to characterise the invertebrate communities of several pans (both natural and impaired). A combination of taxonomic and functional approaches was followed to study these communities. The macroinvertebrate species diversity of the pans was comparable to similar ecosystems in southern Africa and other parts of the world. Results indicate large spatial and temporal variations in diversity. This variation became less obvious when the analysis was based on biological traits. It was also evident that both coal mining and agricultural activities had an impact on the aquatic invertebrate community structures. These changes were apparent in both the diversity and the biological traits of the invertebrate communities of adjacent pans.

AB MicroRNA (miRNA) are a class of small, single-stranded, non-coding RNA that regulate mRNA expression at the post-transcriptional level and play important roles in many fundamental biological processes. There is emerging evidence that miRNA are critical regulators of widespread cellular functions, such as differentiation, proliferation, and migration. At present, little is known about miRNA expression profiles related to skeletal muscle growth in aquatic organisms. This study aimed to investigate the phenotypic variation in the body growth of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and to identify and quantify the differential expression levels of selected growth-related transcriptomic miRNA in the skeletal muscle of this fish. To this end, we performed next-generation sequencing to define the full miRNA transcriptome in muscle tissue from Nile tilapia and to detect differentially expressed miRNA between 2 strains of Nile tilapia. These tilapia strains exhibited significant (P < 0.05) phenotypic variation with respect to growth-related traits (body length and BW), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype diversity, and the differential expression of selected growth-related genes. The results obtained from the transcriptome analysis and real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed significant differences in miRNA expression between fast-growing and control strains of tilapia. Digital gene expression (DGE) profiling was performed based on the obtained read abundance, and we identified down-regulated miRNA, including let-7j, miR-140, miR-192, miR-204, miR-218a, miR-218b, miR-301c, and miR-460, and up-regulated miRNA, including let-7b, let-7c, miR-133, miR-152, miR-15a, miR-193a, miR-30b, and miR-34, associated with body growth in tilapia. These results were further validated using real-time qRT-PCR and microarray profiling. In summary, the up-and down-regulation of miRNA involved in the GH/IGF-1 axis signaling pathway suggests that the differential expression levels of growth-related miRNA may serve as molecular markers that are predictive of specific functional and diagnostic implications. The obtained data on genetic polymorphisms in miRNA-target interactions are particularly useful for Nile tilapia breeding programs.

AB Quercus suber and Quercus ilex trees are major elements of Mediterranean landscapes, which are threatened by the increasing water deficits related to climate change. To contribute to the understanding of the capacity of these oaks to withstand severe drought we assessed the vulnerability to xylem embolism and the anatomical traits in current-year shoots. Data were collected in mature trees at two sites, in central/coastal and southern/inland Portugal. In situ safety margins to hydraulic failure were evaluated from long-term predawn and midday leaf water potential records. Results showed that xylem vulnerability to embolism was similar in Q. ilex and Q suber. The 50% loss in hydraulic conductivity (Psi(xyl,50PLC)) was observed at xylem water potentials of -2.9 and -3.2 MPa in shoots of Q. suber and Q. ilex, respectively. Values of mean vessel diameter of Q suber shoots at both sites suggest an intra-species adaptation to the local water availability, with larger vessels at the more mesic site. In situ hydraulic safety margins observed in shoots showed that, even during the driest periods, both oaks lived comfortably above the most critical embolism thresholds. However, the hydraulic safety margins were narrower in the driest site. Results are relevant to the understanding of survival. growth, and functional behaviour of evergreen oaks in Mediterranean climates, under recurrent/seasonal drought conditions.

AB European foredunes are almost exclusively colonised by Ammophila arenaria, and both the natural succession and the die-out of this plant have been linked to populations of plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN). The overarching aim of this study was to investigate top-down control processes of PPN in these natural ecosystems through comparative analyses of the diversity and dynamics of PPN and their microbial enemies. Our specific aims were, first, to identify and quantify PPN microbial enemies in European sand dunes; second, to assess their life history traits, their spatial and temporal variation in these ecosystems, and third, to evaluate their control potential of PPN populations. This was done by seasonal sampling of a range of sites and making observations on both the nematode and the microbial enemy communities in rhizosphere sand. Nine different nematode microbial enemies belonging to different functional groups were detected in European sand dunes. Their high diversity in these low productivity ecosystems could both result from or lead to the lack of dominance of a particular nematode genus. The distribution of microbial enemies was spatially and temporally variable, both among and within sampling sites. Obligate parasites, either with low host-specificity or having the ability to form an environmentally resistant propagule, are favoured in these ecosystems and are more frequent and abundant than facultative parasites. Three microbial enemies correlated, either positively or negatively, with PPN population size: Catenaria spp., Hirsutella rhossiliensis and Pasteuria penetrans. Microbial-enemy supported links in the food-web may be involved in the control of PPN populations through indirect effects. The endospore-forming P. penetrans was the most successful top-down control agent, and was implicated in the direct control of Meloidogyne spp. and indirect facilitation of Pratylenchus spp. Overall, our findings suggest strong and diverse top-down control effects on the nematode community in these natural ecosystems.

AB Understanding models of networks formation is fundamental to explore the role of the structure in the functioning of the systems they describe, and their ability to respond to change. In this work, we aimed to understand whether and how the modular (or compartmented) structure of a network composed by macroinvertebrates and leaf detritus in six pools of aquatic system was related with the decomposition process. First, we evaluated the relationship between the temporal patterns of leaf detritus colonization and the modular subdivision of the network. Modularity was then related with the clustering of the pools based on convergent traits of leaf detritus consumption and environmental conditions. A significant relationship between the colonization patterns and the distribution of taxa and pools in well-defined modules was found. The modular and clustering subdivision of the pools showed a significant overlap, which revealed the intimate linkage between the structure and functioning of the system. Modularity shapes the functional architecture of the network, by increasing the spatial differences of leaf litter decomposition over time and the diversity of functional traits among detritus feeder. As a consequence, modularity influences the variability of communities' responses to disturbance, increasing the diversity and robustness of functional processes. Our results have also implications from a conservation point of view, showing the importance of habitat heterogeneity for the robustness of ecosystem functioning, potentially enhancing biodiversity with positive, long-term effect on the whole food web.

AB Question Coastal dunes are a globally distributed ecosystem characterized by roughly linear geography, strong habitat connectivity, and strong small-scale internal gradients in disturbance and stress. Disturbance, stress and competition are often considered the main ecological forces driving plant community assembly, but their relative importance in coastal dunes is not well elucidated. Phylogenetic community structure reflects the processes controlling community assembly across ecological and evolutionary time scales. We investigate for the first time how disturbance, competition and stress gradients shape phylogenetic community structure in coastal dune plant assemblages. Location Europe's largest coastal dune area (1450km2), west coast of Jutland, Denmark. Methods As a measure of phylogenetic community structure we calculated net relatedness index (NRI) for 2702 dune plots containing a total of 483 vascular plant species. To assess the assumption that closely related species resemble each other more than at random, we tested for phylogenetic signal in plant adaptations to stress, competition and disturbance, as represented by Grime's C-S-R values. We then used regression analyses of NRI against mean Grime C-S-R plot values to assess the influence of disturbance, competition and stress gradients on phylogenetic community structure. Finally, we assessed if these relationships reflected anthropogenic factors by computing species' anthropogenic affinity and then regressing mean anthropogenic affinity for each plot on NRI and Grime's C-S-R plot values. Results Grime's C-S-R values all showed a phylogenetic signal. Phylogenetic community structure was predominantly clustered at both local and regional scales. This clustering was related to disturbance, as high clustering was consistently associated with high dominance of disturbance-adapted species (high Grime's R scores). Importantly, a strong correlation between these and mean anthropogenic affinity suggests that the disturbance effect on phylogenetic community structure was at least partially anthropogenic. Conclusion Dune plant phylogenetic community structure is shaped by the phylogenetic signal in plant adaptations to the main ecological gradients in coastal dunes, with filtering by human-associated disturbance playing the strongest role. Our study supports previous findings of a linkage between anthropogenic disturbance and phylogenetic clustering of species, and suggests that this may be a more general pattern.

TI Shifts in Functional Traits of Aquatic Insects along a Subtropical
   Stream in Taiwan
SO ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES
DT Article
DE Life history traits; Habitat templet hypothesis; RLQ analysis;
   Fourth-corner analysis
AB Despite an increasing interest in the study of functional diversity, there have been no attempts to link aquatic insect traits, habitat variations, and community structure in subtropical Asian streams. We examined relationships between habitat characteristics and aquatic insect traits at 7 sites along a subtropical stream in Taiwan by an RLQ analysis and fourth-corner analysis. The habitat was described by the slope, mineral substrate size, and water chemistry, while aquatic insect traits were described using 40 categories of 9 functional traits. The 1st axis of the RLQ analysis explained 96.5%, suggesting a strong longitudinal environmental gradient structuring the characteristics of sites and aquatic insect assemblages. The most influential habitat variables were the slope, mineral substrate size, conductivity, and alkalinity, which reflected both natural variations and human impacts along the stream. The main covariations between traits and habitat were a shift from organisms with combining features, such as crawlers, a large body size, a flat body form, and low body flexibility to organisms which are swimmers, possess high body flexibility and a small body size, and feed on fine detritus and microinvertebrates. In the results of the fourth-corner analysis, 18 of 40 trait categories were significantly correlated with environmental variables. In particular, traits relating to flow, such as body form, attachment to substrate, body flexibility, and food type, showed the strongest correlations with environmental variables. Longitudinal gradients of aquatic insect assemblages corresponded to a gradual shift from aquatic insects that preferred larger and more stable mineral substrates (rubble) to those that preferred still waters in lowlands with finer substrates. The results suggested that the low substrate heterogeneity and stability at downstream sites led to a simpler but less stable functional organization, and that functional traits should be sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in environmental variables and can be used for biomonitoring streams in Taiwan.

TI Taxonomic Relatedness of Spider and Carabid Assemblages in a Wetland

SO ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES
DT Article
DE Ecology; Taxonomic distinctness; Diversity; Functional traits; Habitat
   disturbance
AB Traditional community indices, i.e. Shannon diversity and Simpson's dominance, are generally used to describe biological assemblages in order to infer ecological trends about the effects of disturbance. Such indices are correlated with species richness and abundance and may be strongly influenced by the sampling effort. Conversely, taxonomic relatedness indices show interesting statistical properties and are independent of the sampling effort. Additionally, high values of taxonomical relatedness indices have proven to reflect habitat functionality in marine ecosystems. Their use in terrestrial ecosystems is rare, and despite their good potential, they have never been used for biodiagnostic purposes. In this paper, we present the 1st application of taxonomic relatedness indices to arthropod assemblages (namely spiders and carabids) and their comparison with several traditional community parameters that are generally used to evaluate environmental disturbances. The study was set in a wetland area within the Natural Reserve of Fondo Toce (northwestern Italy). Four different habitats with different degrees of disturbance (a reed bed, a mown meadow, a riparian wood with mesophilous elements, and a transitional mesohygrophilic area invaded by non-native vegetation) were sampled using pitfall traps. The spider and carabid assemblages occurring in each habitat were characterized by means of multidimensional scaling (MDS) and by several community parameters, including abundance, species richness diversity, taxonomic relatedness indices, and some descriptive functional traits. Differences among habitats were tested with generalized linear models. Correlations among community parameters were evaluated with Spearman's rank correlations. According to the MDS plots, both assemblages were clearly separated in relation to habitat type. When considering the parameters describing the assemblages in relation to disturbance, the taxonomic approach was found to be particularly suitable for spiders, for which the less-disturbed habitat was characterized by higher values of average taxonomic distinctness. Furthermore, functional groups of spiders were more evenly distributed in undisturbed habitats. The functional approach was found particularly appropriate for carabids, which responded to disturbance in terms of a decrease in biomass (average body size) and an increase in the proportional abundance of macropterous individuals. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/51.7/1175.pdf

AB There is a long tradition of river monitoring using taxonomy-based metrics to assess environmental quality in Europe via benthic macroinvertebrate communities. A promising alternative is the use of their species life-history traits. Both methods (taxonomy-based and trait-based), however, have relied on the time-consuming identification of taxa. River biotopes, (i.e. 1-100 m(2) 'habitats' with associated species assemblages), have long been seen as a useful and meaningful way of linking the ecology of macroinvertebrates and river hydro-morphology and can be used to assess hydro-morphological degradation in rivers. However, between-river taxonomic differences, especially at large spatial scale, had prevented a general test of this concept until now. The species trait approach may overcome this obstacle across broad geographical areas, using biotopes as the hydro-morphological units which have characteristic species trait assemblages. We collected macroinvertebrate data from discrete 512 patches, comprising 13 river biotopes, from seven rivers in England and Wales. The aim was to test whether river biotopes were better predictors of macroinvertebrate trait profiles than taxonomic composition (genera, families, orders) in rivers, independently of the phylogenetic effects and catchment scale characteristics (i.e. hydrology, geography and land cover). We also tested whether species richness and diversity were better related to biotopes than to rivers. River biotopes explained 40% of the variance in macroinvertebrate trait profiles across the rivers, largely independently of catchment characteristics. There was a strong phylogenetic signature, however. River biotopes were better at predicting macroinvertebrate trait profiles than taxonomic composition across rivers, whatever the taxonomic resolution. River biotopes were better than river identity at explaining the variability in taxonomic richness and diversity (40% and <= 10%, respectively). Detailed trait-biotope associations agreed with independent a priori predictions relating trait categories to near river bed flows. Hence, species traits provided a much needed mechanistic understanding and predictive ability across a broad geographical area. We show that integration of the multiple biological trait approach with river biotopes at the interface between ecology and hydro-morphology provides a wealth of new information and potential applications for river science and management.

AB Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) is a recently proposed method for addressing ecological functioning based on traits exhibited by members of biological assemblages. This multi-trait approach was applied to the soft-bottom subtidal macrobenthic communities of the Mondego estuary (Portugal), aiming to assess its functioning following a management measure implemented in this system. In particular, the response of benthic assemblages to restoration efforts was investigated over a 5-year period, testing for temporal differences before and after management, in order to assess the effectiveness of this recovery action.
   BTA revealed to be a useful approach providing valuable information on the functioning of the subtidal benthic communities. Overall, results suggested that there have been some changes in the ecosystem over the study period, although the success of the management measure at the benthic functional level revealed unclear. The climatic variability experienced in the estuary over the monitoring period seemed to have played a significant role in masking the potential effects of restoration. Furthermore, evidence suggested a possible persistence in the benthic functioning despite the occurrence of shifts in taxonomic composition, assured by the potential ability of different species with an alike set of traits to perform similar roles in the ecosystem.
   To best of our knowledge, this study constituted one of the first attempts to investigate the effects of a management measure in an estuary by means of Biological Traits Analysis. As such, it can thus be useful as a guideline for further management actions in the Mondego estuary extendable to other poikilohaline estuaries as well, and to provide insights on the BTA application to this type of ecosystems.

AB In the present study, biological traits analysis (BTA) was used to explore and characterise effects of pollution on functional attributes of soft bottom infaunal species assemblages. The data comprised 38 sampling stations in the Oslofjord, Norway, ranging from heavily polluted to minimally impacted areas. At each station, species composition (113 taxa in total), contaminants (cadmium, mercury, lead, DDT, PCB) and sediment parameters were determined. Species functions were analysed for eight biological traits defined for activity and life history features. Traits were scored according to the fuzzy coding technique. The most distinct patterns were shown for mobility, size, sediment dwelling depth, feeding type and larval development in relation to contaminants, sediment physical structure and sediment oxidation status. At high levels of contaminants, particularly cadmium, features such as shallow sediment dwelling depth, small size, subsurface deposit feeding and lecitotroph larval development prevailed, while at low contaminant levels characteristic features included deeper sediment dwelling depth, larger size, surface deposit feeding and permanent attachment. Deep sediment dwelling depth (>15 cm) was related to minimally contaminated oxidised sediments at greater water depths. Mobility and carnivorous feeding prevailed in coarser sediments. The study showed that BTA detected and depicted specific features that correlated with gradients in pollution and may be important for sediment reworking and nutrient cycling. As part of the present work, trait information for >500 macrofaunal taxa have been assembled and entered in a comprehensive database. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change has complex structural impacts on coastal ecosystems. Global warming is linked to a widespread decline in body size, whereas increased flood frequency can amplify nutrient enrichment through enhanced run-off. Altered population body-size structure represents a disruption in top-down control, whereas eutrophication embodies a change in bottom-up forcing. These processes are typically studied in isolation and little is known about their potential interactive effects. Here, we present the results of an in situ experiment examining the combined effects of top-down and bottom-up forces on the structure of a coastal marine community. Reduced average body mass of the top predator (the shore crab, Carcinus maenas) and nutrient enrichment combined additively to alter mean community body mass. Nutrient enrichment increased species richness and overall density of organisms. Reduced top-predator body mass increased community biomass. Additionally, we found evidence for an allometrically induced trophic cascade. Here, the reduction in top-predator body mass enabled greater biomass of intermediate fish predators within the mesocosms. This, in turn, suppressed key micrograzers, which led to an overall increase in microalgal biomass. This response highlights the possibility for climate-induced trophic cascades, driven by altered size structure of populations, rather than species extinction.

AB We investigated patterns in species richness and diversity, life-history traits and functional diversity of carabid beetles and spiders along a coastal heathland successional gradient. We sampled in five successional stages on the island of Hiddensee, Germany. Species richness of carabids and spiders and Simpson diversity for spiders did not differ among stages. Functional dispersion (FDis), a measure of functional richness, was lowest in the youngest stage for both carabids and spiders. Older successional stages represent more heterogeneous habitats and offer a broader range of niches, which might enhance functional dispersion. Functional evenness (FEve) differed among successional stages for spiders, indicating an uneven distribution of species abundances in the functional trait space. Functional divergence (FDiv) did not differ among stages for either taxon. Shifts in life-history traits were noted in both arthropod groups, but not always in the same direction: Body size of carabid beetles increased towards older successional stages, but decreased for spiders. The number of flightless carabid species increased towards older habitats. Each successional stage seemingly favors species with distinct life-history traits (species sorting). We conclude that a trait-based approach including the use of functional diversity measurements (FDis) could contribute valuable information for biodiversity conservation.

AB Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is an important seed crop throughout the Andean region of South America. It is important as a regional food security crop for millions of impoverished rural inhabitants of the Andean Altiplano (high plains). Efforts to improve the crop have led to an increased focus on genetic research. We report the identification of 14,178 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a genomic reduction protocol as well as the development of 511 functional SNP assays. The SNP assays are based on KASPar genotyping chemistry and were detected using the Fluidigm dynamic array platform. A diversity screen of 113 quinoa accessions showed that the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the SNPs ranged from 0.02 to 0.50, with an average MAF of 0.28. Structure analysis of the quinoa diversity panel uncovered the two major subgroups corresponding to the Andean and coastal quinoa ecotypes. Linkage mapping of the SNPs in two recombinant inbred line populations produced an integrated linkage map consisting of 29 linkage groups with 20 large linkage groups, spanning 1404 cM with a marker density of 3.1 cM per SNP marker. The SNPs identified here represent important genomic tools needed in emerging plant breeding programs for advanced genetic analysis of agronomic traits in quinoa.

AB 1. Coleoptera species show considerable diversity in life histories and ecological strategies, which makes possible their wide distribution in freshwater habitats, including highly stressed ones such as saline or temporary waterbodies. Explaining how particular combinations of traits allow species to occupy distinctive habitats is a central question in ecology. 2. A total of 212 sites, sampled over a wide range of inland aquatic habitats in the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula, yielded 272 species belonging to 68 genera and 11 families. The affinities of genera for 11 biological and 11 ecological traits, gathered from literature and the authors own expertise, were used to assess the degree of congruence between taxonomic, biological and ecological traits. 3. Taxonomic richness was significantly related to the number of both biological and ecological trait categories, with the richest families also showing the highest functional and ecological diversity. A fuzzy correspondence analysis performed on the abundance-weighed array of biological traits separated genera according to categories of diet, feeding habits, respiration, reproduction and locomotion. A similar analysis of ecological traits revealed that preferences related to longitudinal distribution (headwater to mouth), local habitat and current velocity best discriminated genera. At the family level, there was a distinctive functional grouping of genera based on biological traits. Only Elmidae showed noticeable homogeneity across genera for both biological and ecological traits. 4. Co-inertia analysis demonstrated a significant match between biological and ecological traits (Rv-correlation = 0.35, P < 0.001). Elmidae genera displayed the highest concordance, whereas Hydraenidae demonstrated the lowest. 5. These results indicate that the predominance of habitat filtering processes in headwater streams yields biological trait conservatism (as shown by Elmidae genera), as well as trait convergence for some specific traits (for instance, respiration) among certain Dytiscidae genera and other typical rheophilic taxa, whereas other biotic factors, such as competition among species, appear more prominent in less stressed habitats. Further knowledge of traits, especially regarding physiological capabilities, is needed to better understand water beetle life history strategies.

AB Disturbance-mediated species loss has prompted research considering how ecosystem functions are changed when biota is impaired. However, there is still limited empirical evidence from natural environments evaluating the direct and indirect (i.e. via biota) effects of disturbance on ecosystem functioning. Oxygen deficiency is a widespread threat to coastal and estuarine communities. While the negative impacts of hypoxia on benthic communities are well known, few studies have assessed in situ how benthic communities subjected to different degrees of hypoxic stress alter their contribution to ecosystem functioning. We studied changes in sediment ecosystem function (i.e. oxygen and nutrient fluxes across the sediment water-interface) by artificially inducing hypoxia of different durations (0, 3, 7 and 48 days) in a subtidal sandy habitat. Benthic chamber incubations were used for measuring responses in sediment oxygen and nutrient fluxes. Changes in benthic species richness, structure and traits were quantified, while stress-induced behavioral changes were documented by observing bivalve reburial rates. The initial change in faunal behavior was followed by non-linear degradation in benthic parameters (abundance, biomass, bioturbation potential), gradually impairing the structural and functional composition of the benthic community. In terms of ecosystem function, the increasing duration of hypoxia altered sediment oxygen consumption and enhanced sediment effluxes of NH4+ and dissolved Si. Although effluxes of PO43- were not altered significantly, changes were observed in sediment PO43- sorption capability. The duration of hypoxia (i.e. number of days of stress) explained a minor part of the changes in ecosystem function. Instead, the benthic community and disturbancedriven changes within the benthos explained a larger proportion of the variability in sediment oxygen-and nutrient fluxes. Our results emphasize that the level of stress to the benthic habitat matters, and that the link between biodiversity and ecosystem function is likely to be affected by a range of factors in complex, natural environments.

AB There is consensus that biodiversity losses will result in declining ecosystem functioning if species have different functional traits. Phylogenetic diversity has recently been suggested as a predictor of ecosystem functioning because it could approximate the functional complementarity among species. Here we describe an experiment that takes advantage of the rapid evolutionary response of bacteria to disentangle the role of phylogenetic and species diversity. We impose a strong selection regime on marine bacterial lineages and assemble the ancestral and evolved lines in microcosms of varying lineage and phylogenetic diversity. We find that the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and productivity is strong for the ancestral lineages but brakes down for the evolved lineages. Our results not only emphasize the potential of using phylogeny to evaluate ecosystem functioning, but also they warn against using phylogenetics as a proxy for functional diversity without good information on species evolutionary history.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key component of the carbon cycle and has significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems and potable water treatment. Upward trends in river and lacaustrine DOC concentrations have been observed and a number of key drivers have been proposed. Here, we present DOC concentration data from plot scale pore waters at one site and surface water from artificial drains sampled within a national survey which demonstrate a significant correlation between peatland vegetation type and DOC concentration. Calluna dominance was associated with the highest DOC concentration, Molinia and Sphagnum dominance with lower concentrations, and sedge dominance with intermediate concentrations. Water sampled from drains dominated by Calluna had greater DOC concentrations than water sampled from pore waters in plots dominated by Calluna. In contrast DOC concentrations from plots dominated by sedges were greater than those sampled from drains dominated by sedges. We discuss these findings in relation to plant functional traits and their influence on the physical and biotic conditions that regulate DOC concentrations. Given the known effects of management activities and climate change on peatland vegetation composition there is potential to manage plant community composition to ameliorate the observed rising DOC concentration.

AB Despite the long history of vegetation mapping with remote sensing, challenges remain in effectively linking remote sensing observations with plant traits and environmental disturbance across species and functional types. This study proposes a classification of aquatic and wetland vegetation plant functional types (PFTs) using time series remotely sensed data applicable to wetland ecosystems with large annual water level changes like Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake-wetland of China. We first developed the aquatic and wetland PFT classification scheme which included perennial C-4 grasses, perennial C-3 reed, C-3 (sedges and taller forbs), short C-3 forbs, floating aquatic macrophytes, and submerged aquatic macrophytes. Using this scheme, time series normalized difference vegetation index (time series NDVI) images and time series vegetation-water index (time series VWI) images extracted from 32-m spatial resolution Beijing-1 microsatellite data were applied to perform two PFT classifications with a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. We found that the time series NDVI-based SVM classification method mapped aquatic and wetland PFT distribution with an overall accuracy of 81.3%. However, when the information on water level fluctuation was combined with time series NDVI into a new time series index (referred to as time series VWI), the overall accuracy increased to 90.4%. Results suggest that time series VWI has a stronger capability in distinguishing wetland PFTs with different submersion times and flood tolerances than time series NDVI, and thus may be considered as a key input dataset for future PFt classifications in seasonally dynamic wetlands.

AB Deterministic niche-based processes have been proposed to explain species relative abundance within communities but lead to different predictions: habitat filtering (HF) predicts dominant species to exhibit similar traits while niche differentiation (ND) requires that species have dissimilar traits to coexist. Using a multiple trait-based approach, we evaluated the relative roles of HF and ND in determining species abundances in productive grasslands. Four dimensions of the functional niche of 12 co-occurring grass species were identified using 28 plant functional traits. Using this description of the species niche, we investigated patterns of functional similarity and dissimilarity and linked them to abundance in randomly assembled six-species communities subjected to fertilization/disturbance treatments. Our results suggest that HF and ND jointly determined species abundance by acting on contrasting niche dimensions. The effect of HF decreased relative to ND with increasing disturbance and decreasing fertilization. Dominant species exhibited similar traits in communities whereas dissimilarity favored the coexistence of rare species with dominants by decreasing inter-specific competition. This stabilizing effect on diversity was suggested by a negative relationship between species over-yielding and relative abundance. We discuss the importance of considering independent dimensions of functional niche to better understand species abundance and coexistence within communities.

AB Ecological risk assessment (ERA) has followed a taxonomy-based approach, making the assumption that related species will show similar sensitivity to toxicants, and using safety factors or species sensitivity distributions to extrapolate from tested to untested species. In ecology it has become apparent that taxonomic approaches may have limitations for the description and understanding of species assemblages in nature. Therefore it has been proposed that the inclusion of species traits in ERA could provide a useful and alternative description of the systems under investigation. At the same time, there is a growing recognition that the use of mechanistic approaches in ERA, including conceptual and quantitative models, may improve predictive and extrapolative power. Purposefully linking traits with mechanistic effect models could add value to taxonomy-based ERA by improving our understanding of how structural and functional system facets may facilitate inter-species extrapolation. Here, we explore whether and in what ways traits can be linked purposefully to mechanistic effect models to predict intrinsic sensitivity using available data on the acute sensitivity and toxicokinetics of a range of freshwater arthropods exposed to chlorpyrifos. The results of a quantitative linking of seven different endpoints and twelve traits demonstrate that while quantitative links between traits and/or trait combinations and process based (toxicokinetic) model parameters can be established, the use of simple traits to predict classical sensitivity endpoints yields little insight. Remarkably, neither of the standard sensitivity values, i.e. the LC50 or EC50, showed a strong correlation with traits. Future research in this area should include a quantitative linking of toxicodynamic parameter estimations and physiological traits, and requires further consideration of how mechanistic trait-process/parameter links can be used for prediction of intrinsic sensitivity across species for different substances in ERA.

AB Ecological stoichiometry is an indicator of function and nutrient limitation from individual to ecosystem levels, yet it is still unclear whether leaf stoichiometry patterns are homologous at different scales. We determined the leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentrations, N:P ratio and leaf traits across 42 woody species planted at Hangzhou Bay Coastal Shelter Forest Experimental Site in Southeast China. We analyzed variation patterns in leaf stoichiometry, correlated leaf stoichiometry with leaf traits, and determined nutrient limitations based on leaf stoichiometry. Leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratio averaged 18.58 mg g(-1), 2.24 mg g(-1) and 9.56, respectively. Leaf N and P concentrations were positively correlated while leaf P and leaf N:P ratio were negatively correlated across all species. Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) had a significant relationship with leaf P concentration and N:P ratio for all species, while specific leaf area (SLA) was significantly related to leaf N concentration for broadleaf species. Leaf N concentration and N:P ratio varied greatly within a site. Among the 42 species, 27 were found to be limited by N, one by P, one co-limited by N and P. and the rest not limited by either N or P. Our results provide a theoretical guideline for the construction and management of coastal shelter forests in Southeast China. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Production of all-female populations in turbot can increase farmer's benefits since sexual dimorphism in growth in this species is among the highest within marine fish, turbot females reaching commercial size 3-6 months earlier than males. Puberty in males occurs earlier than in females, which additionally slows their growth. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms of sex determination and gonad differentiation is a relevant goal for turbot production. A ZZ/ZW sex determination mechanism has been suggested for this species, and four sex-related quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected, the major one located in linkage group (LG) 5 and the three minor ones in LG6, LG8, and LG21. In the present work, we carried out a linkage analysis for several sex-related markers: (1) three anonymous sex-associated RAPD and (2) several candidate genes related to sex determination and gonad differentiation in other species (Sox3, Sox6, Sox8, Sox9, Sox17, Sox19, Amh, Dmrta2, Cyp19a, Cyp19b). We focused our attention on their co-localization with the major and minor sex-related QTL trying to approach to the master sex-determining gene of this species. Previously described growth-related QTL were also considered since the association observed between growth and sex determination in fish. Amh, Dmrta2, and one RAPD were located in LG5, while Sox9 and Sox17 (LG21), Cyp19b (LG6), and a second RAPD (LG8) co-mapped with suggestive sex-related QTL, thus supporting further analyses on these genes to elucidate the genetic basis of this relevant trait for turbot farming.

AB Biological trait analysis (BTA) is a method that describes ecological functioning of species assemblages incorporating information on species' distributions and their biological characteristics. In the present study, soft bottom communities of three Mediterranean coastal lagoons with different degree of salinity range were analyzed for seven biological traits (mobility, habitat, feeding type, habitat modification, body form, body size and feeding apparatus) in order to investigate the differences in communities' structure and functional diversity across a scale of natural stress. In more variable environments semi-mobile and epibenthic organisms prevailed, while predators were found under more stable conditions. Multivariate analyses using biological traits gave similar results with those obtained by the traditional analyses using species abundances; however, the distinction among lagoons was less evident, indicating that in transitional waters species can be different but their biological traits similar. This supports the idea of species redundancy in transitional water ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Premise of the study: The filamentous chlorophyte Cladophora produces abundant nearshore populations in marine and freshwaters worldwide, often dominating periphyton communities and producing nuisance growths under eutrophic conditions. High surface area and environmental persistence foster such high functional and taxonomic diversity of epiphytic microfauna and microalgae that Cladophora has been labeled an ecological engineer. We tested the hypotheses that (1) Cladophora supports a structurally and functionally diverse epiphytic prokaryotic microbiota that influences materials cycling and (2) mutualistic host-microbe interactions occur. Because previous molecular sequencing-based analyses of the microbiota of C. glomerata found as western Lake Michigan beach drift had identified pathogenic associates such as Escherichia coli, we also asked if actively growing lentic C. glomerata harbors known pathogens.
   Methods: We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing to examine the microbiota of C. glomerata of Lake Mendota, Dane, Wisconsin, United States, during the growing season of 2011, at the genus-or species-level to infer functional phenotypes. We used correlative scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy to describe major prokaryotic morphotypes.
   Key results: We found microscopic evidence for diverse bacterial morphotypes, and molecular evidence for ca. 100 distinct sequence types classifiable to genus at the 80% confidence level or species at the 96-97% level within nine bacterial phyla, but not E. coli or related human pathogens.
   Conclusions: We inferred that bacterial epiphytes of lentic C. glomerata have diverse functions in materials cycling, with traits that indicate the occurrence of mutualistic interactions with the algal host.

AB Much is known about how environmental stress mediates the strength of facilitation, but less is known about how different plant traits affect facilitation. We examined interactions between the shrub Tamarix chinensis and two congeneric forbs (Suaeda salsa and S. glauca) on the Chinese coast. Although S. salsa and S. glauca are both annuals, morphologically similar, and have synchronous phenologies, they have contrasting adaptive strategies. S. glauca is salt intolerant but competitively superior, and S. salsa is salt tolerant but competitively inferior. Field surveys showed that S. glauca was associated with T. chinensis canopies while S. salsa was more abundant in open areas. A T. chinensis removal experiment showed that S. glauca cover was lower and soil salinity higher after two years in removal than in control plots. Transplant experiments showed that S. salsa performance under T. chinensis canopies was reduced by competition from S. glauca and T. chinensis, while in open areas S. glauca was not affected by S. salsa competition. Thus, contrasting competitive abilities and stress tolerances of S. glauca and S. salsa underlie their facilitative and competitive interactions with T. chinensis, suggesting that plant strategies are critical to the outcome of species interactions.

AB Detritus processing is driven by a complex interplay between macroinvertebrate and microbial activities. Bioturbation/feeding activities of invertebrates in sediments are known to influence decomposition rates. However, direct effects of invertebrates on bacterial communities and detritus processing remain ill-defined, mainly because identifying interactions between invertebrates and sediments is methodologically challenging. We incubated 5 macroinvertebrate species with various bioturbation/feeding traits separately in sediment-filled microcosms inoculated with bacterial communities for 5 d. At the end of the experiment, we assessed: 1) detritus processing (mass loss on ignition [LOI] and dissolved organic C accumulation in the overlying water [absorbance at 280 nm]), 2) bacterial community structure (intergenic spacer analysis [RISA]) and bacterial activity (electron transport system activity [ETSA]), and 3) development of redox potential (Eh) over time (with permanently installed microelectrodes). Invertebrates enhanced bacterial activity and detritus processing, and the magnitude depended on bioturbation/feeding traits. Bacterial community structure differed significantly between microcosms with burrowing invertebrates and microcosms with sediment-dwelling invertebrates. Eh profiles were similar among microcosms with invertebrates with similar bioturbation/feeding traits, but differed among microcosms with invertebrates with dissimilar bioturbation/feeding traits. Our results suggest that bioturbation by aquatic invertebrates mediates detritus processing, Eh dynamics, and structure of the microbial community. These findings highlight the significance of bioturbation and show the utility of spatiotemporal Eh dynamics as footprints reflecting functioning of benthic detrital food webs.

AB The oceans cover 70% of the planet's surface, and their planktonic inhabitants generate about half the global primary production, thereby playing a key role in modulating planetary climate via the carbon cycle. The ocean biota have been under scientific scrutiny for well over a century, and yet our understanding of the processes driving natural selection in the pelagic environment - the open water inhabited by drifting plankton and free-swimming nekton - is still quite vague. Because of the fundamental differences in the physical environment, pelagic ecosystems function differently from the familiar terrestrial ecosystems of which we are a part. Natural selection creates biodiversity but understanding how this quality control of random mutations operates in the oceans - which traits are selected for under what circumstances and by which environmental factors, whether bottom-up or top-down - is currently a major challenge. Rapid advances in genomics are providing information, particularly in the prokaryotic realm, pertaining not only to the biodiversity inventory but also functional groups. This essay is dedicated to the poorly understood tribes of planktonic protists (unicellular eukaryotes) that feed the ocean's animals and continue to run the elemental cycles of our planet. It is an attempt at developing a conceptually coherent framework to understand the course of evolution by natural selection in the plankton and contrast it with the better-known terrestrial realm. I argue that organism interactions, in particular co-evolution between predators and prey (the arms race), play a central role in driving evolution in the pelagic realm. Understanding the evolutionary forces shaping ocean biota is a prerequisite for harnessing plankton for human purposes and also for protecting the oceanic ecosystems currently under severe stress from anthropogenic pressures.

AB Aim Ecologists seeking to describe patterns at ever larger scales require compilations of data on the global abundance and distribution of species. Comparable compilations of biological data are needed to elucidate the mechanisms behind these patterns, but have received far less attention. We assess the availability of biological data across an entire assemblage: the well-documented demersal marine fauna of the United Kingdom. We also test whether data availability for a species depends on its taxonomic group, maximum body size, the number of times it has been recorded in a global biogeographic database, or its commercial and conservation importance. Location Seas of the United Kingdom. Methods We defined a demersal marine fauna of 973 species from 15 phyla and 40 classes using five extensive surveys around the British Isles. We then quantified the availability of data on eight key biological traits (termed biological knowledge) for each species from online databases. Relationships between biological knowledge and our predictors were tested with generalized linear models. Results Full data on eight fundamental biological traits exist for only 9% (n= 88) of the UK demersal marine fauna, and 20% of species completely lack data. Clear trends in our knowledge exist: fish (median biological knowledge score = six traits) are much better known than invertebrates (one trait). Biological knowledge increases with biogeographic knowledge and (to a lesser extent) with body size, and is greater in species that are commercially exploited or of conservation concern. Main conclusions Our analysis reveals deep ignorance of the basic biology of a well-studied fauna, highlighting the need for far greater efforts to compile biological trait data. Clear biases in our knowledge, relating to how well sampled or important species are suggests that caution is required in extrapolating small subsets of biologically well-known species to ecosystem-level studies.

AB 1. To assess the biological status and response of aquatic resources to management actions, managers and decision-makers require accurate and precise metrics. This is especially true for some parts of the Florida Everglades where multiple stressors (e.g. hydrologic alterations and eutrophication) have resulted in a highly degraded and fragmented ecosystem. Biological assessments are required that directly allow for the evaluation of historical and current status and responses to implantation of large-scale restoration projects. 2. Utilising periphyton composition and water-quality data obtained from long-term (15 years) monitoring programmes, we developed calibrated and verified periphyton-based numerical models (transfer functions) that could be used to simultaneously assess multiple stressors affecting the Everglades peatland (e.g. salinity, nitrogen and phosphorus). Periphyton is an ideal indicator because responses to stressors are rapid and predictable and possess valued ecological attributes. 3. Weighted averaging partial least squares regression was used to develop models to infer water-quality concentrations from 456 samples comprising 319 periphyton taxa. Measured versus periphyton-inferred concentrations were strongly related for log-transformed salinity ( = 0.81; RMSEP 0.15 mg L-1) and log-transformed total phosphorus (TP; = 0.70; RMSEP 0.18 mg L-1), but weakly related for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) ( = 0.46; RMSEP 0.12 mg L-1). Validation results using an independent 455 sample data set were similar (log(salinity) r2 = 0.78, log(TP) r2 = 0.65 and log(TKN) r2 = 0.38). 4. Water Conservation Area 1 (WCA-1), a large ombrotrophic subtropical peatland impacted by multiple water-quality stressors that has undergone major changes in water management, was used as a case study. The models were applied to a long-term periphyton data set to reconstruct water-quality trends in relation to restoration efforts to reduce nutrient loading to the Everglades. The combination of biologically inferred TP and salinity was used to identify the ecological status of periphyton assemblages. Periphyton assemblages were ecologically imbalanced with respect to salinity and TP. Salinity imbalance varied spatially and temporally, whereas TP was spatially restricted. Imbalances caused by water management were owing to salinity more so than to TP. 5. The transfer functions developed for the Everglades are trait-based quantitative numerical methods and are ideal because the abundances of species are modelled numerically in relation to a stressor. The resulting inferred value is a numerical representation of the stressors effect on biological condition that can be compared against the management of the stressor independent of other factors. The benefits are that biological lags or hysteresis events can easily be identified and environmental conditions can be estimated when measurements are lacking. Reporting biological assessments in terms of well-defined water-quality metrics (e.g. numeric criterion) increased the communicative ability of the assessment. The use of multiple metrics to assess ecological imbalance increased the ability to identify probable causes.

AB The occasion of the Xenarthra Symposium during the ICVM 9 meeting allowed us to reflect on the considerable advances in the knowledge of sloths made by the "X-community" over the past two decades, particularly in such aspects as locomotion, mastication, diet, dental terminology, intraspecific variation, sexual dimorphism, and phylogenetic relationships. These advancements have largely been made possible by the application of cladistic methodology (including DNA analyses) and the discovery of peculiar forms such as Diabolotherium, Thalassocnus, and Pseudoglyptodon in traditionally neglected areas such as the Chilean Andes and the Peruvian Pacific desert coast. Modern tree sloths exhibit an upside-down posture and suspensory locomotion, but the habits of fossil sloths are considerably more diverse and include locomotory modes such as inferred bipedality, quadrupedality, arboreality or semiarboreality, climbing, and an aquatic or semi-aquatic lifestyle in saltwater. Modern tree sloths are generalist browsers, but fossil sloths had browsing, grazing, or mixed feeding dietary habits. Discovery of two important sloth faunas in Brazil (Jacobina) and southern North America (Daytona Beach and Rancho La Brea) have permitted evaluation of the ontogenetic variation in Eremotherium laurillardi and the existence of possible sexual dimorphism in this sloth and in Paramylodon harlani. A new dental terminology applicable to a majority of clades has been developed, facilitating comparisons among taxa. An analysis wherein functional traits were plotted onto a phylogeny of sloths was used to determine patterns of evolutionary change across the clade. These analyses suggest that megatherioid sloths were primitively semiarboreal or possessed climbing adaptations, a feature retained in some members of the family Megalonychidae. Pedolateral stance in the hindfoot is shown to be convergently acquired in Mylodontidae and Megatheria (Nothrotheriidae + Megatheriidae), this feature serving as a synapomorphy of the latter clade. Digging adaptations can only be securely ascribed to scelidotheriine and mylodontine sloths, and the latter are also the only group of grazing sloths, the remainder being general browsers.

AB Human-induced reductions in species richness might alter the quality of ecosystem services when the remaining species are not able to substitute the functions provided by extirpated species. We examined how human disturbances (nutrient enrichment, land use intensification, instream habitat degradation and the presence of alien species) influence the species richness of stream invertebrates. Stream invertebrates (425 native species) were collected by kick and sweep sampling technique at 274 stream sites covering the entire area of Hungary. We measured the species richness, functional richness (i.e. number of unique functional roles provided by community members) and functional redundancy (i.e. the functional insurance of the community) using information on the feeding habits of each species. To remove the effect of natural variability, we tested the effect of stressors on the residuals of models relating species richness, functional richness and functional redundancy with natural environmental gradients. Our results showed that species richness was negatively influenced by instream habitat degradation and nutrient enrichment. Independent of the way of quantifying functional richness and functional redundancy, we found that functional richness is more sensitive to human impact than functional redundancy of stream invertebrates. The finding that a reduction of species richness is associated with a loss of unique functional roles (functional richness) is important for conservation issues, because the number of unique functional roles is usually regarded as driver of ecosystem functioning.

AB Tetrapods possess up to five morphologically distinct vertebral series: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral and caudal. The evolution of axial regionalization has been linked to derived Hox expression patterns during development and the demands of weight-bearing and walking on land. These evolutionary and functional explanations are supported by an absence of similar traits in fishes, living and extinct. Here, I show that, Tarrasius problematicus, a marine ray-finned fish from the Mississippian (Early Carboniferous; 359-318 Ma) of Scotland, is the first non-tetrapod known to possess tetrapod-like axial regionalization. Tarrasius exhibits five vertebral regions, including a seven-vertebrae 'cervical' series and a reinforced 'sacrum' over the pelvic area. Most vertebrae possess processes for intervertebral contact similar to tetrapod zygapophyses. The fully aquatic Tarrasius evolved these morphologies alongside other traits convergent with early tetrapods, including a naked trunk, and a single median continuous fin. Regional modifications in Tarrasius probably facilitated pelagic swimming, rather than a terrestrial lifestyle or walking gait, presenting an alternative scenario for the evolution of such traits in tetrapods. Axial regionalization in Tarrasius could indicate tetrapod-like Hox expression patterns, possibly representing the primitive state for jawed vertebrates. Alternately, it could signal a weaker relationship, or even a complete disconnect, between Hox expression domains and vertebrate axial plans.

AB Background: Estuaries are highly productive ecosystems that can export organic matter to coastal seas (the 'outwelling hypothesis'). However the role of this food resource subsidy on coastal ecosystem functioning has not been examined.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the influence of estuarine primary production as a resource subsidy and the influence of estuaries on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in coastal mollusk-dominated sediment communities. Stable isotope values (delta C-13, delta N-15) demonstrated that estuarine primary production was exported to the adjacent coast and contributed to secondary production up to 4 km from the estuary mouth. Further, isotope signatures of suspension feeding bivalves on the adjacent coast (Dosinia subrosea) closely mirrored the isotope values of the dominant bivalves inside the estuaries (Austrovenus stutchburyi), indicating utilization of similar organic matter sources. However, the food subsidies varied between estuaries; with estuarine suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) dominant at Tairua estuary, while seagrass and fringing vegetation detritus was proportionately more important at Whangapoua estuary, with lesser contributions of estuarine SPOM. Distance from the estuary mouth and the size and density of large bivalves (Dosinia spp.) had a significant influence on the composition of biological traits in the coastal macrobenthic communities, signaling the potential influence of these spatial subsidies on ecosystem functioning.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our study demonstrated that the locations where ecosystem services like productivity are generated are not necessarily where the services are utilized. Further, we identified indirect positive effects of the nutrient subsidies on biodiversity (the estuarine subsidies influenced the bivalves, which in turn affected the diversity and functional trait composition of the coastal sediment macrofaunal communities). These findings highlight the importance of integrative ecosystem-based management that maintains the connectivity of estuarine and coastal ecosystems.

AB Spatial and interannual variations of phytoplankton diversity were characterized along the French Atlantic Coast in relation to physical factors and large-scale climatic indices using phytoplankton surveys conducted from 1993 to 2010 in four geographical areas. This study relates phytoplankton diversity to oyster recruitment success by comparing a 'specific' versus a 'functional' diversity approach. Functional diversity was represented by functional groups of different phytoplanktonic functional traits (size, shape, toxicity), relevant for oyster feeding during growth, reproduction and larval development. Phytoplankton diversity patterns along the French Atlantic coast corresponded to a geographical distribution mainly driven by a latitudinal gradient and hydrodynamic features as confirmed by the functional characteristics of the indicator species recorded for each geographical area (C-S-R strategies of Reynolds, specific habitat). This geographical typology was less clear for functional diversity. Only few functional groups were explained by physical factors: the non-toxic small and solitary cells were in particular related to temperature, with high densities observed in the southern areas. Even if temporal variation was less important in explaining the phytoplankton diversity patterns, the main drivers explaining the interannual pattern were the large-scale climatic indices, mainly the Atlantic Multidecennal Oscillation. Functional groups were readily explained by climatic indices than species even if the relationships cannot be applied generally because of the non-linearity of the correlations (local and temporal variations). However, the potentially toxic, small and linear phytoplankton were anticorrelated to NAO. The functional approach thus brings constructive elements concerning the relationships between the prey assemblage of oysters and their physical drivers. Redundancy and co-inertia analyses appeared as complementary analyses in investigating phytoplankton pattern of variation, being particularly useful in analyzing geographical and temporal diversity fluctuation, respectively.

AB Macroinvertebrate species traits, such as physiological sensitivity, have successfully been introduced in trait-based bioassessment approaches and are important predictors of species sensitivity in the field. The authors ranked macroinvertebrate species according to their physiological sensitivity to heavy metals using toxicity data from acute laboratory assays. Rankings for each of the heavy metals, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Hg, were standardized based on all available species data. Rankings for different heavy metals on the species level showed no significant difference between compounds and were reasonably well correlated pairwise (0.50?<?r?<?0.73). Thus, an aggregated heavy metal ranking was developed, which assigns a single physiological sensitivity value (Smetal) to macroinvertebrate taxa. Considering the high variation, especially for higher taxonomic levels, that is, in the order level, it is recommended to use S values of the genus or species level for meaningful analyses. In terms of taxonomic ranking, crustaceans were overall the most sensitive taxonomic group, whereas insects were generally the most tolerant group. Species in the order of Cladocera were three orders of magnitude more sensitive than insects of the order of Trichoptera. By contrast, mollusks covered a wide range of sensitivities, with bivalves being on average one order of magnitude more sensitive than gastropods. The authors concluded that physiological sensitivity represents a promising trait for trait-based risk assessment that together with other demographic and recolonization traits may help to identify the effects of heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Ecomorphological changes as a result of natural perturbations in estuarine fish communities were investigated in two South African estuaries (Swartvlei and East Kleinemonde), both before and after the loss of aquatic macrophyte beds in these systems. The fish communities were analysed using an ecomorphological diversity index (EMI) and the results compared to a traditional index, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. The EMI revealed that the major changes in fish community composition recorded in both estuaries were associated with quantitative variations at the species level. Both estuaries essentially lost their macrophyte beds and ended up with the same type of bottom habitat (bare sediment). In both cases the fish morphological variability decreased immediately after aquatic macrophyte loss and then increased to end above the initial value. The ecomorphological analysis appeared to be sensitive to major ecological disturbances that occurred during the study period and this was confirmed by the morphospace configuration. The results indicate that the ecomorphology of the fish community responds to habitat changes and that this change corresponds to alterations in the representation of the different feeding types. These findings therefore contribute to the measurement of morphological changes in estuarine fish assemblages as a result of habitat changes within the ecosystem and we propose that ecomorphological analyses add another dimension to the information provided by existing diversity indices in studying changing fish communities.

AB Environmental risk assessments (ERA) support regulatory decisions for the commercial cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops. The ERA for terrestrial agroecosystems is well-developed, whereas guidance for ERA of GM crops in aquatic ecosystems is not as well-defined. The purpose of this document is to demonstrate how comprehensive problem formulation can be used to develop a conceptual model and to identify potential exposure pathways, using Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize as a case study. Within problem formulation, the insecticidal trait, the crop, the receiving environment, and protection goals were characterized, and a conceptual model was developed to identify routes through which aquatic organisms may be exposed to insecticidal proteins in maize tissue. Following a tiered approach for exposure assessment, worst-case exposures were estimated using standardized models, and factors mitigating exposure were described. Based on exposure estimates, shredders were identified as the functional group most likely to be exposed to insecticidal proteins. However, even using worst-case assumptions, the exposure of shredders to Bt maize was low and studies supporting the current risk assessments were deemed adequate. Determining if early tier toxicity studies are necessary to inform the risk assessment for a specific GM crop should be done on a case by case basis, and should be guided by thorough problem formulation and exposure assessment. The processes used to develop the Bt maize case study are intended to serve as a model for performing risk assessments on future traits and crops.

AB Question Is there evidence for similar community assembly processes in two geographically disjunct examples of a rare alpine ecosystem? Location Two alpine granite gravel fields 610 km apart along a fault line in western South Island, New Zealand the Lookout Range and Mt Titiroa. Methods Plot-based vascular plant composition and traits for 86 species (height, seed length, leaf size and nutrient concentrations) were used to examine community structure reflecting assembly processes. We examined species richness, trait values averaged across species and plots, relationships between trait pairs using standardized major axis (SMA) regression and phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC), relationships between abundance and trait values, and functional diversity indices against null models. Lastly, we partitioned taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity within and across alpine ranges. Results Functional and phylogenetic turnover of diversity between the two locations was low (2.9% and 6.3%, respectively) relative to turnover of taxonomic diversity (75%). Species-level traits were similar between the two locations, except leaf P, which was higher at Mt Titiroa. Plot-level average traits were all significantly higher on Mt Titiroa. Relationships between species-level traits were typically non-significant at both locations, or significant only at a single location. In contrast, relationships between plot-level trait values were frequently significant and consistent across the two locations. At both locations, dominant species had a narrow range of similar trait values, while rare species had a wide range of values. Within plots, we found both trait convergence and divergence. Associations of trait values among dominant and rare species were largely non-random but inconsistent between the two locations. Conclusions The two locations had a similar pool of trait values but often differed in how those traits were assembled. Results demonstrate that dominant species are subject to rigorous filters during community assembly leading to trait convergence, but rare species contributed to trait diversity and trait divergence. Models of community assembly can often predict traits of dominant species but must consider the importance of rare species as a source of local trait diversity, even in species-poor communities under severe environmental conditions.

AB Parrotfishes and surgeonfishes perform important functional roles in the dynamics of coral reef systems. This is a consequence of their varied feeding behaviors ranging from targeted consumption of living plant material (primarily surgeonfishes) to feeding on detrital aggregates that are either scraped from the reef surface or excavated from the deeper reef substratum (primarily parrotfishes). Increased fishing pressure and widespread habitat destruction have led to population declines for several species of these two groups. Species-specific data on global distribution, population status, life history characteristics, and major threats were compiled for each of the 179 known species of parrotfishes and surgeonfishes to determine the likelihood of extinction of each species under the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Due in part to the extensive distributions of most species and the life history traits exhibited in these two families, only three (1.7%) of the species are listed at an elevated risk of global extinction. The majority of the parrotfishes and surgeonfishes (86%) are listed as Least Concern, 10% are listed as Data Deficient and 1% are listed as Near Threatened. The risk of localized extinction, however, is higher in some areas, particularly in the Coral Triangle region. The relatively low proportion of species globally listed in threatened Categories is highly encouraging, and some conservation successes are attributed to concentrated conservation efforts. However, with the growing realization of man's profound impact on the planet, conservation actions such as improved marine reserve networks, more stringent fishing regulations, and continued monitoring of the population status at the species and community levels are imperative for the prevention of species loss in these groups of important and iconic coral reef fishes.

AB Large-bodied zooplankton play important roles in the flow of nutrients and energy along the food chain in freshwater ecosystems. However, the importance of functional traits of zooplankton in trophic flow is not well understood. We used the minimal food-chain model, which includes producers (algae), first-order consumers (grazer zooplankton), and secondary consumers (fish), to reveal which functional traits of phyto- or zooplankton affect one of the most important ecosystem processes for functioning, the trophic transfer efficiency (TTE) across three trophic levels. Numerical simulations indicated that, regardless of the level of nutrient loading and the fish density, the conversion coefficient of grazer zooplankton was one of the most important and general factors for determining TTE. The antipredator defense and maximum grazing rate of zooplankton greatly affected TTE, but the effect depended on the level of nutrient loading and the fish density. For an ecosystem that had high nutrient loading and high fish density and in which the zooplankton density was regulated by the top-down effect, antipredator defense and maximum grazing enhanced TTE. Opposite relationships were observed for other states of the ecosystem. In general, those functional traits of the first-order consumers that affected vertical ecological interaction were important for trophic flow in the ecosystem, whereas the sensitivity of trophic flow to these traits depended largely on whether the zooplankton were regulated by the bottom-up or the top-down effect.

AB Microorganisms often form symbiotic relationships with eukaryotes, and the complexity of these relationships can range from those with one single dominant symbiont to associations with hundreds of symbiont species. Microbial symbionts occupying equivalent niches in different eukaryotic hosts may share functional aspects, and convergent genome evolution has been reported for simple symbiont systems in insects. However, for complex symbiont communities, it is largely unknown how prevalent functional equivalence is and whether equivalent functions are conducted by evolutionarily convergent mechanisms. Sponges represent an evolutionarily divergent group of species with common physiological and ecological traits. They also host complex communities of microbial symbionts and thus are the ideal model to test whether functional equivalence and evolutionary convergence exist in complex symbiont communities across phylogenetically divergent hosts. Here we use a sampling design to determine the phylogenetic and functional profiles of microbial communities associated with six sponge species. We identify common functions in the six microbiomes, demonstrating the existence of functional equivalence. These core functions are consistent with our current understanding of the biological and ecological roles of sponge-associated microorganisms and also provide insight into symbiont functions. Importantly, core functions also are provided in each sponge species by analogous enzymes and biosynthetic pathways. Moreover, the abundance of elements involved in horizontal gene transfer suggests their key roles in the genomic evolution of symbionts. Our data thus demonstrate evolutionary convergence in complex symbiont communities and reveal the details and mechanisms that underpin the process.

AB Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are natural physical features of the world's oceans. They create steep physiochemical gradients in the water column, which most notably include a dramatic draw down in oxygen concentrations over small vertical distances (<100 m). Microbial communities within OMZs play central roles in ocean and global biogeochemical cycles, yet we still lack a fundamental understanding of how microbial biodiversity is distributed across OMZs. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to investigate microbial diversity across a vertical gradient in the water column during three seasons in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) OMZ. Based on analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene fragments, we found that both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity declined steeply along the transition from oxygen-rich surface water to the permanent OMZ. We observed similar declines in the diversity of protein-coding gene categories, suggesting a decrease in functional (trait) diversity with depth. Metrics of functional and trait dispersion indicated that microbial communities are phylogenetically and functionally more over-dispersed in oxic waters, but clustered within the OMZ. These dispersion patterns suggest that community assembly drivers (e.g., competition, environmental filtering) vary strikingly across the oxygen gradient. To understand the generality of our findings, we compared OMZ results to two marine depth gradients in subtropical oligotrophic sites and found that the oligotrophic sites did not display similar patterns, likely reflecting unique features found in the OMZ. Finally, we discuss how our results may relate to niche theory, diversity-energy relationships and stress gradients.

AB Our knowledge of how coastal species react to, and recover from, tsunamis is deficient because of the infrequency of these events, despite the importance of such information for ecological risk assessment of coastal hazards. To elucidate the differences in resilience among species and the successional processes of coastal sand-dune flora after tsunamis, we monitored the ecological impacts of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami on coastal sand-dune species on Phuket Island, Thailand. Using 127 floristic inventory datasets, we compared the occurrence, species composition, characteristics, and eco-morphological adaptations of coastal sand-dune species before and after the tsunami. Among the 73 species recognized, the occurrences of 28 changed significantly after the tsunami. The impacts on coastal sand-dune species of non-coastal sand-dune species invading the dunes after the disaster were temporary and minimal, perhaps because of constant coastal stresses such as sand movement and salt spray. Damage to woody species was less than that to herbaceous species. There were clear post-tsunami differences in the successional trajectories of coastal sand-dune flora (particularly herbaceous vegetation) between protected beaches with low-level anthropogenic disturbance and resort beaches. The tsunami-related qualitative variations on each beach were clearly explained not by changes in the Shannon-Wiener diversity index but by differences in species number (i.e., species richness). Numbers of coastal sand-dune species (particularly monophytes and those growing clonally by stolons) decreased significantly on protected beaches after the tsunami. We suggest that the recovery process-including its direction, trajectory, and duration-in coastal sand-dune species after tsunamis depends strongly on the individual beach structure and the degree of anthropogenic disturbance, including trampling pressure and beach development. Evaluation of species in terms of functional traits is effective for assessing sand-dune status after tsunamis.

AB Variation in chemical energy, that is food availability, is posited to cause variation in body size. However, examinations of the relationship are rare and primarily limited to amniotes and zooplankton. Moreover, the relationship between body size and chemical energy may be impacted by phylogenetic history, clade-specific ecology, and heterogeneity of chemical energy in space and time. Considerable work remains to both document patterns in body size over gradients in food availability and understanding the processes potentially generating them. Here, we examine the functional relationship between body size and chemical energy availability over a broad assortment of marine mollusks varying in habitat and mobility. We demonstrate that chemical energy availability is likely driving body size patterns across habitats. We find that lower food availability decreases size-based niche availability by setting hard constraints on maximum size and potentially on minimum size depending on clade-specific ecology. Conversely, higher food availability promotes greater niche availability and potentially promotes evolutionary innovation with regard to size. We posit based on these findings and previous work that increases in chemical energy are important to the diversification of Metazoans through size-mediated niche processes.

AB Theories that link plant strategies and abiotic filters discriminate between three strategies: competitive, ruderal or stress-tolerant species, and suggest that functional diversity is higher at intermediate values along the gradients of productivity and disturbance. The mechanism by which abiotic filters screen plant traits in aquatic plant communities has been poorly tested and has led to contrasting results. The present study aimed to test whether functional diversity and abundance of life-history traits corresponding to morphology, fecundity and longevity of aquatic plants were linked to disturbance and productivity. Fifty-nine shallow lakes that were arranged along a gradient of productivity (estimated through total phosphorus concentration) and drought-disturbance frequency were sampled for aquatic plants. Species traits were documented and functional diversity was calculated (richness, dispersion and evenness) for each lake. Increasing total phosphorus concentration was associated with decreased functional richness and dispersion but not functional evenness. Functional diversity did not differ according to disturbance frequency, regardless of the index that was measured. High productivity favoured floating species with storage organs and vegetative reproduction, especially at low disturbance frequency. For all disturbance frequencies, low productivity favoured small species without storage organs and sexual reproduction. The present study partly supports the theoretical model. At high productivity levels, because phytoplankton is a better competitor for light than aquatic plants, plant traits are screened stringently, and species with traits that allow them to reach the photic zone are selected.

AB Mainstreaming ecosystem services into policy and decision making is dependent on the availability of spatially explicit information on the state and trends of ecosystems and their services. In particular, the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 addresses the need to account for ecosystem services through biophysical mapping and valuation. This paper reviews current mapping methods, identifies current knowledge gaps and provides the elements for a methodological framework for mapping and assessing ecosystems and their services at European scale. Current mapping methodologies go beyond purely land cover based assessments and include the use of primary data of ecosystem services, the use of functional traits to map ecosystem services and the development of models and ecological production functions. Additional research is needed to cover marine ecosystems and to include the resilience of ecosystems to environmental change in spatially explicit assessments. The ecosystem services cascade which connects ecosystems to human wellbeing is argued to provide a suitable, stepwise framework for mapping ecosystem services in order to support EU policies in a more effective way. We demonstrate the use of this framework for mapping using the water purification service as case. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB As the earth system changes in response to human activities, a critical objective is to predict how biogeochemical process rates (e.g. nitrification, decomposition) and ecosystem function (e.g. net ecosystem productivity) will change under future conditions. A particular challenge is that the microbial communities that drive many of these processes are capable of adapting to environmental change in ways that alter ecosystem functioning. Despite evidence that microbes can adapt to temperature, precipitation regimes, and redox fluctuations, microbial communities are typically not optimally adapted to their local environment. For example, temperature optima for growth and enzyme activity are often greater than in situ temperatures in their environment. Here we discuss fundamental constraints on microbial adaptation and suggest specific environments where microbial adaptation to climate change (or lack thereof) is most likely to alter ecosystem functioning. Our framework is based on two principal assumptions. First, there are fundamental ecological trade-offs in microbial community traits that occur across environmental gradients (in time and space). These trade-offs result in shifting of microbial function (e.g. ability to take up resources at low temperature) in response to adaptation of another trait (e.g. limiting maintenance respiration at high temperature). Second, the mechanism and level of microbial community adaptation to changing environmental parameters is a function of the potential rate of change in community composition relative to the rate of environmental change. Together, this framework provides a basis for developing testable predictions about how the rate and degree of microbial adaptation to climate change will alter biogeochemical processes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems across the planet.

AB Mountain stream monitoring is closely related to the survey of bryophyte species since it is there that these organisms are common and show very specialized ecological niches. This work hypothesizes that a close relationship between bryophyte taxonomic and functional categories and microhabitat conditions exists and proposes to explore this link as a basis for fine-scale monitoring.
   The distribution of bryophytes in mountain fluvial microhabitats of northwest and centre-west Portugal was examined at 165 locations. The response of higher level taxonomic groups and life forms and strategies categories along fine-scale hydromorphologic gradients in mountain streambeds was evaluated through multivariate statistical analysis and models.
   Frequency and abundance patterns suggested that species taxonomic groups and life forms and strategies categories distribution are mostly determined by the same microhabitat variables: water velocity, local light incidence and hydrologic zone in the streambed. Additionally, the distribution trends of each category are presented in graphic models summarizing the habitat segregation of bryophyte traits. The specificity of bryophyte distribution patterns were calibrated in undisturbed mountain watercourse to explore their use in monitoring fine-scale variation of flow and light regimes caused by anthropic influence.

AB Biodiversity is a measure of the total difference within a biological system. It is understood to arise at genetic, species and multiple levels of community organisation, hence is multidimensional in nature. Biodiversity indices have proliferated in attempts to capture this complexity but may now have confounded it. Here we attempt a reduction to the minimal set of metrics needed to describe biodiversity (often by default taken to be species richness). 1000 model communities with realistic taxonomic composition were synthesised using databases of marine benthic species. A battery of 19 biodiversity indices were calculated for every community and analysed by PCA to show inter-dependence and sensitivity to variation in taxonomic (a surrogate for genetic), functional (based on ecological roles) and structural (based on species abundance) diversity. We found the three major axes of biodiversity were (a) structural complexity, and (b) two different mixtures of taxonomic and functional diversity: it was well approximated by a three-dimensional space of these variables. A scalar distance from the origin of this space could serve as a single valued summary where needed, for example in economic valuations. The most widely used single biodiversity measure - species richness - missed 88.6% of the diversity, emphasising the importance of additional characters and the need for species databases to record functional traits, presence and abundance in communities, and phylogenetic information.

AB Invasive habitat-forming ecosystem engineers modify the abiotic environment and thus represent a major perturbation to many ecosystems. Because native species often persist in these invaded habitats but have no shared history with the ecosystem engineer, the engineer may impose novel selective pressure on native species. In this study, we used a phenotypic selection framework to determine whether an invasive habitat-forming ecosystem engineer (the seaweed Caulerpa taxifolia) selects for different phenotypes of a common co-occurring native species (the bivalve Anadara trapezia). Compared to unvegetated habitat, Caulerpa habitat has lower water flow, lower dissolved oxygen, and sediments are more silty and anoxic. We determined the performance consequences of variation in key functional traits that may be affected by these abiotic changes (shell morphology, gill mass, and palp mass) for Anadara transplanted into Caulerpa and unvegetated habitat. Both linear and nonlinear performance gradients in Anadara differed between habitats, and these gradients were stronger in Caulerpa compared to unvegetated sediment. Moreover, in Caulerpa alternate phenotypes performed well, and these phenotypes were different from the dominant phenotype in unvegetated sediment. By demonstrating that phenotype-performance gradients differ between habitats, we have highlighted a role for Caulerpa as an agent of selection on native species.

AB 1. Recently a number of rarefaction curves including information on species functional traits were proposed for those measures of functional diversity that monotonically increase with species richness. 2. Building on these methods, in this paper, we propose a functional rarefaction curve for species abundance data that is obtained using the classical diversity decomposition of the Rao quadratic diversity into alpha, beta and gamma diversity. 3. The proposed abundance-based functional rarefaction is illustrated with one dedicated case study in sand dune communities in Italy. 4. Although we put emphasis on functional diversity only, because of its mathematical generality, the proposed method can be extended to virtually any abundance-weighted concave measure for comparing diversity among habitats sampled with different effort.

AB Background: The gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) occurs around the Mediterranean and along Eastern Atlantic coasts from Great Britain to Senegal. It is tolerant of a wide range of temperatures and salinities and is often found in brackish coastal lagoons and estuarine areas, particularly early in its life cycle. Gilthead sea bream are extensively cultivated in the Mediterranean with an annual production of 125,000 metric tonnes. Here we present a de novo assembly of the fast skeletal muscle transcriptome of gilthead sea bream using 454 reads and identify gene paralogues, splice variants and microsatellite repeats. An annotated transcriptome of the skeletal muscle will facilitate understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of traits linked to production in this economically important species.
   Results: Around 2.7 million reads of mRNA sequence data were generated from the fast myotomal of adult fish (similar to 2 kg) and juvenile fish (similar to 0.09 kg) that had been either fed to satiation, fasted for 3-5d or transferred to low (11 degrees C) or high (33 degrees C) temperatures for 3-5d. Newbler v2.5 assembly resulted in 43,461 isotigs >100 bp. The number of sequences annotated by searching protein and gene ontology databases was 10,465. The average coverage of the annotated isotigs was x40 containing 5655 unique gene IDs and 785 full-length cDNAs coding for proteins containing 58-1536 amino acids. The v2.5 assembly was found to be of good quality based on validation using 200 full-length cDNAs from GenBank. Annotated isotigs from the reference transcriptome were attributable to 344 KEGG pathway maps. We identified 26 gene paralogues (20 of them teleost-specific) and 43 splice variants, of which 12 had functional domains missing that were likely to affect their biological function. Many key transcription factors, signaling molecules and structural proteins necessary for myogenesis and muscle growth have been identified. Physiological status affected the number of reads that mapped to isotigs, reflecting changes in gene expression between treatments.
   Conclusions: We have produced a comprehensive fast skeletal muscle transcriptome for the gilthead sea bream, which will provide a resource for SNP discovery in genes with a large effect on production traits of commercial interest and for expression studies of growth and adaptation.

AB Among a total of 27 cultivable salt tolerant endophytic bacteria isolated from grown in highly salt affected coastal region of cuddalore district, Tamilnadu, India four isolates were found to be positive for nitrogenase activity. The isolates were evaluated for their stress tolerance efficiency and screened for different PGP traits. Based on the above studied parameters, and ability to produce 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase (4.24 mu mol alpha-ketobutyrate mg(_1) protein h(_1)) the salt tolerant diazotrophic isolate AUM54 was selected for further investigation and identified as by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The ability of this isolate to ameliorate salt stress in was evaluated under gnotobiotic and pot culture conditions. At 150 mM NaCl level AUM54 treated plants recorded ethylene level of 394.1 p mol ethylene g(-1) FW h(-1) compared to the ethylene level of 516.0 p mol ethylene g(-1) FW h(-1) recorded in the un inoculated control. AUM54 inoculated plants recorded the maximum germination percentage of 98.3, vigor index of 2231.4, plant height of 120.4 cm, root dry weight of 53.24 g Plant(_1) and ajmalicine content of 1.60 mg g(-1), compared to the germination percentage of 91.6%, vigour index of 1511.5, plant height of 105.8, root weight of 47.2 g Plant(-1), and ajmalicine content of 1.23 mg g(-1) in uninoculated plants grown without NaCl treatment. This isolate also decreased plant ethylene levels by 11-23% and increased the antioxidative enzyme content of inoculated plants to the tune of 19-32% for ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity, 20-30% for superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and 4-16% for catalase (CAT) under normal and salt affected conditions.

AB The assumption that ecosystems with similar emergent properties consist of similar functional groupings of plant species is tested by comparing three peatlands from different bioregions across South Africa. They are Mfabeni Swamp in the subtropical coastal region, Wakkerstroom on the inland plateau, and Goukou wetland in the Winter Rainfall region of the Western Cape. In each of the three peatlands, about 400 small vegetation plots have been made from which the abundance of each species per wetland can be assessed. The most dominant species in these plots have been investigated for 17 traits. The functional composition of the vegetation types has been compared across the three peatlands and Functional Diversity has been calculated, taking the dominance of each species into account. One peatland differed greatly from the other two, since the dominant species was of a functional type ("Palmiet/woody sedge") that was very divergent from any other peatland species found in the study. This functional type can be considered an ecosystem engineer and the effects that this functional type has on the ecosystem results in the occurrence of many other functional types that do not occur in the other peatlands. When we consider emergent traits of an ecosystem as a function of all the plant functional traits that occur in that ecosystem, then peatlands can be regarded as a heterogeneous group of ecosystems. Even if emergent properties such as peat formation are similar between ecosystems, those ecosystems may still consist of very different functional groups. Ecosystem engineers have an impact on the final functional composition of an ecosystem and the degree in which ecosystem engineering plays a role in peatlands differs between different peatlands.

AB The cosmopolitan distribution of the marine planktonic diatom Chaetoceros socialis Lauder is generally interpreted as a case of wide ecological plasticity. However, cryptic diversity has recently been observed within this taxon and this genetic diversity could extend to phenotypic differences between allopatric populations. Monoclonal strains of C. socialis isolated from NE Atlantic/Arctic and Tyrrhenian Sea waters were cultivated at 2.5, 8 and 13C, and analysed for morphological, phylogenetic (LSU rRNA gene) and physiological (growth rate, photosynthetic yield) traits. The molecular analysis indicated an unequivocal divergence between the southern and the northern strains. Clear differences in spore morphology between the two groups were also observed, despite their morphological similarity in vegetative form. The physiological data demonstrated a functional partition between the northern and southern strains. The northern strains showed significantly higher growth rates than the southern ones at the lower temperatures, and vice versa at 13C. Differences between the groups were also observed in the photosynthetic yields. These results reveal the expression of allopatric speciation in several phenotypic characters, providing a functional dimension to the cryptic, or rather pseudo-cryptic, diversity observed within C. socialis. We believe that such an integrated approach is useful for robust taxonomic and functional delimitations of presumed cosmopolitan microorganisms.

AB Nutrient cycles in both terrestrial and many freshwater habitats are fueled by terrestrial detritus. However, direct comparisons of decomposition processes in these environments are scarce. Aiming at shedding light on similarities and differences in these processes in different habitats, we studied decomposition of low-quality versus high-quality detritus through the action of shredders versus grazers in aquatic versus terrestrial microcosms under controlled climatic conditions. Decomposition processes were most strongly affected by whether they took place in the terrestrial or the aquatic environment: Leaching resulted in a rapid mass loss of detritus in the aquatic environment, and detritus traits became less pronounced over time. Thus, breakdown was mediated through dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water but through particulate organic matter (POM) on land. Litter mass loss and the promoting effects of detritivores on mass loss also depended on the environment, but shredders always had a greater effect than grazers. Both litter and detritivore diversity were overall of little relevance for litter mass loss, but more so in the aquatic than the terrestrial environment. By contrast, the influence of detritivores on microbes was stronger in water than on land, but effects depended on the litter type. The type of both litter and detritivores, however, was less significant in the aquatic than in the terrestrial environment, possibly due to leaching and abiotic processing of litter during early decomposition, resulting in diminishing differences between litter types. We conclude that the habitat type shapes the dynamics of leaf litter decomposition. Heavy leaching (in the aquatic environment) shortens initial decomposition phases and dislocates the degradation of easily accessible compounds in the form of DOM from the leaves into the water column. Consequently, initial interspecific differences in litter quality diminish, and both functional differences in, and diversity of, both litter and detritivores become less important than in the terrestrial environment.

AB The rate of information collection generated by metagenomics is uncoupled with its meaningful ecological interpretation. New analytical approaches based on functional trait-based ecology may help to bridge this gap and extend the trait approach to the community level in vast and complex environmental genetic data sets. Here, we explored a set of community traits that range from nucleotidic to genomic properties in 53 metagenomic aquatic samples from the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition. We found significant differences between the community profile derived from the commonly used 16S rRNA gene and from the functional trait set. The traits proved to be valuable ecological markers by discriminating between marine ecosystems (coastal vs. open ocean) and between oceans (Atlantic vs. Indian vs. Pacific). Intertrait relationships were also assessed, and we propose some that could be further used as habitat descriptors or indicators of artefacts during sample processing. Overall, the approach presented here may help to interpret metagenomics data to gain a full understanding of microbial community patterns in a rigorous ecological framework.

AB The nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of fluorescence is an important photoprotective mechanism in particular under dynamic light conditions. Its photoprotective potential was suggested to be a functional trait of algal diversity. In the present study, the influence of the photoprotective capacity on the growth balance was investigated in two diatoms, which possess different NPQ characteristics. It was hypothesized that under fluctuating light conditions Cyclotella meneghiniana Kutz. would benefit from its large and flexible NPQ potential, whereas the comparably small NPQ capacity in Skeletonema costatum (Grev.) Cleve should exert an unfavorable impact on growth. The results of the study clearly falsify this hypothesis. Although C. meneghiniana possesses a fast NPQ component, this diatom was not able to recover its full NPQ capacity under fluctuating light. On the other hand, the induction of NPQ at relatively low irradiance in S. costatum resulted in rather small differences in the fraction of energy dissipation by the NPQ mechanism in the comparison of both diatoms. Larger differences were found in the metabolic characteristics. Both diatoms differed in their biomass composition, with a higher content of lipids in C. meneghiniana but higher amounts of carbohydrates in S. costatum. Finally, the lower degree of reduction in the biomass compensated for the higher respiration rates in S. costatum and resulted in a higher quantum efficiency of biomass production. An indirect correlation between the photoprotective and the metabolic capacity is discussed.

AB Hydrophytes generally exhibit highly acquisitive leaf economics. However, a range of growth forms is evident, from small, free-floating and rapidly growing Lemniden to large, broad-leaved Nymphaeiden, denoting variability in adaptive strategies. Traits used to classify adaptive strategies in terrestrial species, such as canopy height, are not applicable to hydrophytes. We hypothesize that hydrophyte leaf size traits and economics exhibit sufficient overlap with terrestrial species to allow a common classification of plant functional types, sensu Grimes CSR theory.
   Leaf morpho-functional traits were measured for 61 species from 47 water bodies in lowland continental, sub-alpine and alpine bioclimatic zones in southern Europe and compared against the full leaf economics spectrum and leaf size range of terrestrial herbs, and between hydrophyte growth forms.
   Hydrophytes differed in the ranges and mean values of traits compared with herbs, but principal components analysis (PCA) demonstrated that both groups shared axes of trait variability: PCA1 encompassed size variation (area and mass), and PCA2 ranged from relatively dense, carbon-rich leaves to nitrogen-rich leaves of high specific leaf area (SLA). Most growth forms exhibited trait syndromes directly equivalent to herbs classified as R adapted, although Nymphaeiden ranged between C and SR adaptation.
   Our findings support the hypothesis that hydrophyte adaptive strategy variation reflects fundamental trade-offs in economics and size that govern all plants, and that hydrophyte adaptive strategies can be directly compared with terrestrial species by combining leaf economics and size traits.

AB Aim We characterized the annual populations of 170 aphid species by their log abundance, site occupancy and site continuity (i.e. the persistence of species in time) and used this information to make predictions about groups of species that displayed characteristic patterns. By doing so, we aimed to identify commonalities in functional traits (host-alternation; mode of reproduction; life-cycle plasticity; median body size) and host plant geographic range sizes that may indicate why some species are common and others not.
   Location The population dynamics of winged aphids at 27 locations in the United Kingdom were studied.
   Methods The annual numbers of aphids were studied using a dataset comprising over 11 million individuals across 509 site-years. Traits and host plants were analysed using linear mixed effects models and nonlinear regression models.
   Results Linear mixed effects models showed that the fixed effects of host alternation and winter host plant area of occupancy were important in predicting log abundance, site occupancy and site continuity. Life-cycle plasticity was also a significant effect, although not for log abundance. Relationships between site continuity, site occupancy and log abundance were strongly nonlinear. Site continuity always lagged site occupancy, indicating that species were less likely to retain previously occupied sites when abundances were low.
   Main conclusions Aphid traits are a better paradigm than taxonomic relatedness in explaining macroecological patterns. Host alternation induces an annual flux of migrants that engenders higher annual log abundances, consistent with the theory that species with high local densities tend to confer a much wider distribution than those with low densities. The abundance of aphids is monotonically related to the geographic range size of their winter host, suggestive of a strong bottom-up effect (i.e. resource controlled). The areas of occupancy (AOO) of winter host plants constrain aphids to low abundances because a greater proportion of hosts are trees and shrubs which tend to have smaller AOO than herbs and grasses, the common summer host types.

AB Despite the intensity with which ecological information involving habitat complexity has been amassed to date, much remains to be revealed for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanics and implications of the structural complexity of habitats and its influences on ecological communities. This review examines the multi-faceted characteristics of habitat complexity, focusing in particular on aquatic ecosystems. Habitat complexity in aquatic systems is characterised by at least five different traits of physical structure: (1) spatial scales, (2) diversity of complexity-generating physical (structural) elements, (3) spatial arrangement of elements, (4) sizes of elements, (5) abundance/density of elements. Of these five traits, the concept of fractal dimension fully encompasses only the last one; in this sense, habitat complexity is more complex than what fractal measures represent. It is therefore important to investigate exactly which traits of habitat structure are exerting influences on organisms/communities. We hypothesise that, where an entire range of possible fractal dimension D is considered, intermediate levels of D are most likely to be associated with the highest level of biodiversity, to which the body size spectra of assemblages would have a close bearing. In most aquatic ecosystems, broadly two-dimensional structures of bottom substrate at the scale of 1-10 m mean that the addition of vertical, three dimensional structures almost always implies an increase in both the 'diversity' and 'abundance' components of structural elements, resulting in more habitats being made available to organisms of different sizes and functional designs. The conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems would be facilitated by rigorous assessments of linkages between habitat complexity and aquatic communities, for which an integrative approach to habitat complexity seems to offer a useful and versatile framework.

AB Background: Morphostasis of traits in different species is necessary for reconstructing the evolutionary history of complex characters. Studies that place these species into a molecular phylogenetic context test hypotheses about the transitional stages that link divergent character states. For instance, the transition from a phagotrophic mode of nutrition to a phototrophic lifestyle has occurred several times independently across the tree of eukaryotes; one of these events took place within the Euglenida, a large group of flagellates with diverse modes of nutrition. Phototrophic euglenids form a clade that is nested within lineages of phagotrophic euglenids and that originated through a secondary endosymbiosis with green algae. Although it is clear that phototrophic euglenids evolved from phagotrophic ancestors, the morphological disparity between species representing these different nutritional modes remains substantial.
   Results: We cultivated a novel marine euglenid, Rapaza viridis n. gen. et sp. ("green grasper"), and a green alga, Tetraselmis sp., from the same environment. Cells of R. viridis were comprehensively characterized with light microscopy, SEM, TEM, and molecular phylogenetic analysis of small subunit rDNA sequences. Ultrastructural and behavioral observations demonstrated that this isolate habitually consumes a specific strain of Tetraselmis prey cells and possesses a functional chloroplast that is homologous with other phototrophic euglenids. A novel feeding apparatus consisting of a reduced rod of microtubules facilitated this first and only example of mixotrophy among euglenids. R. viridis also possessed a robust photoreception apparatus, two flagella of unequal length, euglenoid movement, and a pellicle consisting of 16 strips and one (square-shaped) whorl of posterior strip reduction. The molecular phylogenetic data demonstrated that R. viridis branches as the nearest sister lineage to phototrophic euglenids.
   Conclusions: The unusual combination of features in R. viridis combined with its molecular phylogenetic position completely conforms to the expected transitional stage that occurred during the early evolution of phototrophic euglenids from phagotrophic ancestors. The marine mixotrophic mode of nutrition, the preference for green algal prey cells, the structure of the feeding apparatus, and the organization of the pellicle are outstanding examples of morphostasis that clarify pivotal stages in the evolutionary history of this diverse group of microbial eukaryotes.

AB Many plant seeds and invertebrates can survive passage through the digestive system of birds, which may lead to long distance dispersal (endozoochory) in case of prolonged retention by moving vectors. Endozoochorous dispersal by waterbirds has nowadays been documented for many aquatic plant seeds, algae and dormant life stages of aquatic invertebrates. Anecdotal information indicates that endozoochory is also possible for fully functional, active aquatic organisms, a phenomenon that we here address experimentally using aquatic snails. We fed four species of aquatic snails to mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and monitored snail retrieval and survival over time. One of the snail species tested was found to survive passage through the digestive tract of mallards as fully functional adults. Hydrobia (Peringia) ulvae survived up to five hours in the digestive tract. This suggests a maximum potential transport distance of up to 300 km may be possible if these snails are taken by flying birds, although the actual dispersal distance greatly depends on additional factors such as the behavior of the vectors. We put forward that more organisms that acquired traits for survival in stochastic environments such as wetlands, but not specifically adapted for endozoochory, may be sufficiently equipped to successfully pass a bird's digestive system. This may be explained by a digestive trade-off in birds, which maximize their net energy intake rate rather than digestive efficiency, since higher efficiency comes with the cost of prolonged retention times and hence reduces food intake. The resulting lower digestive efficiency allows species like aquatic snails, and potentially other fully functional organisms without obvious dispersal adaptations, to be transported internally. Adopting this view, endozoochorous dispersal may be more common than up to now thought.

AB Habitat-forming organisms often determine the structural properties and food resources available to a wide diversity of associated mobile species. Sessile invertebrate assemblages on marine hard substrates support an abundant fauna of mobile invertebrates whose associations with traits of their host assemblages are poorly known. To assess how changes to habitat-forming species are likely to affect their associated mobile fauna, the relationships between abundance, diversity and composition of mobile invertebrates and the diversity, cover and composition of the sessile assemblages they use as habitat were quantified in Sydney Harbour, Australia (33 degrees 50'S, 151 degrees 16'E). Similar compositions of sessile species were more likely to share a similar composition of mobile species, but univariate measures of the habitat (percent cover, species and functional diversity, prevalence of non-indigenous species) did not predict variation in associated mobile assemblages. These results demonstrate that in this habitat it is difficult to predict the diversity of marine assemblages based on common surrogate measures of biodiversity.

AB Inverse trophic cascades are a well explored and common consequence of the local depletion or extinction of top predators in natural ecosystems. Despite a large body of research, the cascading effects of predator removal on ecosystem functions are not as well understood. Developing microcosm experiments, we explored food web changes in trophic structure and ecosystem functioning following biomass removal of top predators in representative temperate and tropical rock pool communities that contained similar assemblages of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. We observed changes in species abundances following predator removal in both temperate and tropical communities, in line with expected inverse effects of a trophic cascade, where predation release benefits the predator's preys and competitors and impacts the preys of the latter. We also observed several changes at the community and ecosystem levels including a decrease in total abundance and mean trophic level of the community, and changes in chlorophyll-a and total dissolved particles. Our results also showed an increase in variability of both community and ecosystem processes following the removal of predators. These results illustrate how predator removal can lead to inverse trophic cascades both in structural and functioning properties, and can increase variability of ecosystem processes. Although observed patterns were consistent between tropical and temperate communities following an inverse cascade pattern, changes were more pronounced in the temperate community. Therefore, aquatic food webs may have inherent traits that condition ecosystem responses to changes in top-down trophic control and render some aquatic ecosystems especially sensitive to the removals of top predators.

AB Assessing the sensitivity of different species to chemicals is one of the key points in predicting the effects of toxic compounds in the environment. Trait-based predicting methods have proved to be extremely efficient for assessing the sensitivity of macroinvertebrates toward compounds with non specific toxicity (narcotics). Nevertheless, predicting the sensitivity of organisms toward compounds with specific toxicity is much more complex, since it depends on the mode of action of the chemical. The aim of this work was to predict the sensitivity of several freshwater macroinvertebrates toward three classes of plant protection products: organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids. Two databases were built: one with sensitivity data (retrieved, evaluated and selected from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ECOTOX database) and the other with biological traits. Aside from the "traditional" traits usually considered in ecological analysis (i.e. body size, respiration technique, feeding habits, etc.), multivariate analysis was used to relate the sensitivity of organisms to some other characteristics which may be involved in the process of intoxication. Results confirmed that, besides traditional biological traits, related to uptake capability (e.g. body size and body shape) some traits more related to particular metabolic characteristics or patterns have a good predictive capacity on the sensitivity to these kinds of toxic substances. For example, behavioral complexity, assumed as an indicator of nervous system complexity, proved to be an important predictor of sensitivity towards these compounds. These results confirm the need for more complex traits to predict effects of highly specific substances. One key point for achieving a complete mechanistic understanding of the process is the choice of traits, whose role in the discrimination of sensitivity should be clearly interpretable, and not only statistically significant.

AB Ecological modelling tools are applied worldwide to support the ecosystem-based approach of marine resources (EAM). In the last decades, numerous applications were attempted in the Mediterranean Sea, mainly using the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) tool. These models were used to analyse a variety of complex environmental problems. Many applications analysed the ecosystem impacts of fishing and assessed management options. Other studies dealt with the accumulation of pollution through the food web, the impact of aquaculture or the ecosystem effects of climate change. They contributed to the scientific aspects of an ecosystem-based approach in the region because they integrated human activities within an ecosystem context and evaluated their impact on the marine food web, including environmental factors. These studies also gathered a significant amount of information at an ecosystem level. Thus, in the second part of this review, we used this information to quantify structural and functional traits of Mediterranean marine ecosystems at regional scales as the illustration of further potentialities of EwE for an EAM. Results highlighted differential traits between ecosystem types and a few between basins, which illustrate the environmental heterogeneity of the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, our analysis evidenced the importance of top predators and small pelagic fish in Mediterranean ecosystems, in addition to the structural role of benthos and plankton organisms. The impact of fishing was high and of a similar intensity in the western, central and eastern regions and showed differences between ecosystem types. The keystone role of species was more prominent in protected environments.

AB The ecological traits and functional capabilities of marine animals have changed significantly since their origin in the late Precambrian. These changes can be analysed quantitatively using multi-dimensional parameter spaces in which the ecological lifestyles of species are represented by particular combinations of parameter values. Here, we present models that describe the filling of this multi-dimensional 'ecospace' by ecological lifestyles during metazoan diversification. These models reflect varying assumptions about the processes that drove ecological diversification; they contrast diffusive expansion with driven expansion and niche conservatism with niche partitioning. Some models highlight the importance of interactions among organisms (ecosystem engineering and predator-prey escalation) in promoting new lifestyles or eliminating existing ones. These models reflect processes that were not mutually exclusive; rigorous analyses will continue to reveal their applicability to episodes in metazoan history.

AB It has long been thought that environmental factors determine plant community assembly, but it is now increasingly argued that geographic spatial processes such as dispersal may also matter. Notably, the metacommunity framework considers local communities to be linked by dispersal and different theories hereunder assign varying importance to dispersal limitation and local environmental species sorting. At present the relative importance of these factors across habitats, geographic regions, and spatial scales remains unclear. The present study assessed the relative importance of species sorting by the local environment and broader-scale geographic spatial processes for local plant species composition using a data set of 3924 plots from coastal dunes across a large region (Denmark). We used ordination to identify the main gradients in species composition, and Linear Mixed-Effects modelling (LME) to estimate the relative importance of local environment and multi-scale random geographic factors as determinants of floristic gradients. In addition, we assessed the dependence of species composition on local environment and geographic distance using Mantel tests. The LME analyses found local species sorting to be the dominant determinant in this metacommunity system, with soil moisture, pH, and fertility requirement patterns explaining >= 77% of the compositional gradients, while geographic factors accounted for <= 2%. Partial Mantel tests confirmed this finding, with 31.6% of the variation in species dissimilarity explained by environmental species sorting and just 1.6% by geographical distance. The apparently limited impact of dispersal limitation or other geographic spatial processes may reflect high habitat continuity and efficient dispersal by strong winds and ocean currents in the Danish coastal-dune metacommunity system.

AB Two opposing niche processes have been shown to shape the relationship between ecological traits and species distribution patterns: habitat filtering and competitive exclusion. Habitat filtering is expected to select for similar traits among coexisting species that share similar habitat conditions, whereas competitive exclusion is expected to limit the ecological similarity of coexisting species leading to trait differentiation. Here, we explore how functional traits vary among 19 understory palm species that differ in their distribution across a gradient of soil resource availability in lower montane forest in western Panama. We found evidence that habitat filtering influences species distribution patterns and shifts community-wide and intraspecific trait values. Differences in trait values among sites were more strongly related to soil nutrient availability than to variation in light or rainfall. Soil nutrient availability explained a significant amount of variation in site mean trait values for 4 of 15 functional traits. Site mean values of leaf nitrogen and phosphorus increased 37 and 64%, respectively, leaf carbon: nitrogen decreased 38%, and specific leaf area increased 29% with increasing soil nutrient availability. For Geonoma cuneata, the only species occurring at all sites, leaf phosphorus increased 34% and nitrogen: phosphorus decreased 42% with increasing soil nutrients. In addition to among-site variation, most morphological and leaf nutrient traits differed among coexisting species within sites, suggesting these traits may be important for niche differentiation. Hence, a combination of habitat filtering due to turnover in species composition and intraspecific variation along a soil nutrient gradient and site-specific niche differentiation among co-occurring species influences understory palm community structure in this lower montane forest.

AB Denitrifying prokaryotes are phylogenetically and functionally diverse. Little is known about the relationship between soil denitrifier community composition and functional traits. We extracted bacterial cells from three cultivated peat soils with contrasting native pH by density gradient centrifugation and investigated their kinetics of oxygen depletion and NO2 -, NO, N2O and N2 accumulation during initially hypoxic batch incubations (0.51 mu M O2) in minimal medium buffered at either pH 5.4 or 7.1 (2 mM glutamate, 2 mM NO3 -). The three communities differed strikingly in NO2 - accumulation and transient N2O accumulation at the two pH levels, whereas NO peak concentrations (2453 nM) were similar across all communities and pH treatments. The results confirm that the communities represent different denitrification regulatory phenotypes, as indicated by previous denitrification bioassays with nonbuffered slurries of the same three soils. The composition of the extracted cells resembled that of the parent soils (PCR-TRFLP analyses of 16S rRNA genes, nirK, nirS and nosZ), which were found to differ profoundly in their genetic composition (Braker et al., ). Together, this suggests that direct pH response of denitrification depends on denitrifier community composition, with implications for the propensity of soils to emit N2O to the atmosphere.

AB Nonnative species may change ecosystem functionality at the expense of native species. Here, we examine the similarity of functional traits of native and nonnative submersed aquatic plants (SAP) in an aquatic ecosystem. We used field and airborne imaging spectroscopy and isotope ratios of SAP species in the SacramentoSan Joaquin Delta, California (USA) to assess species identification, chlorophyll (Chl) concentration, and differences in photosynthetic efficiency. Spectral separability between species occurs primarily in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions, which is associated with morphological and physiological differences. Nonnatives had significantly higher Chl, carotene, and anthocyanin concentrations than natives and had significantly higher photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and d13C values. Results show nonnative SAPs are functionally dissimilar to native SAPs, having wider leaf blades and greater leaf area, dense and evenly distributed vertical canopies, and higher pigment concentrations. Results suggest that nonnatives also use a facultative C4-like photosynthetic pathway, allowing efficient photosynthesis in high-light and low-light environments. Differences in plant functionality indicate that nonnative SAPs have a competitive advantage over native SAPs as a result of growth form and greater light-use efficiency that promotes growth under different light conditions, traits affecting system-wide species distributions and community composition.

AB Aim Phylogenetic and phenotypic patterns among coexisting banksias (Banksia, Proteaceae) in the infertile, fire-prone landscapes of south-western Australia were examined for evidence of community structuring. It was expected that closely related species would be spatially clustered (underdispersed) as a consequence of widespread recent speciation, strong edaphic fidelity and low dispersability. We also expected that edaphic filtering would result in phenotypic clustering of traits related to habitat specialization and that competitive exclusion among closely related species with similar regeneration biology and growth form would result in phenotypic overdispersion of these latter traits. Location Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR). Methods Based on published data for coexistence (richness and frequency) of Banksia species at 40 sites in the three floristic provinces, phylogenetic, soil type and morphological mean pairwise distance and mean nearest taxon distance were calculated for each site and compared with null communities. Patterns of co-occurrence were examined at the local and subregional (provincial) scales. Results Of the 40 sites assessed, 21-30 displayed phylogenetic clustering of Banksia species (5-11 significantly) such that, overall, co-occurring taxa were more closely related than expected by chance. Banksias in the Transitional Rainfall and Southeast Coastal Provinces were more likely to display phylogenetic clustering than in the High Rainfall Province. A significant trend for phylogenetic clustering associated with edaphic specialization (27-30 sites) was observed, as well as a significant trend for phenotypic overdispersion associated with growth form (25-28 sites). Results for regeneration biology depended on the metric used. Main conclusions We demonstrate spatial clustering of closely related banksias at the local and provincial scales, consistent with their restricted distribution (recent widespread speciation, patchy habitat availability and limited dispersability) in this geologically old and stable region. The clustering of closely related species may also be a consequence of habitat filtering linked to edaphic fidelity in the SWAFR flora, while overdispersion in growth form suggests that functional divergence favours coexistence in Banksia communities.

AB Aim We quantify biotic homogenization of fish fauna caused by the elimination of a natural barrier between two freshwater ecoregions. We also evaluated fish introductions by different mechanisms such as aquaculture, angling and the aquarium trade in the homogenization of fish assemblages. The relative importance of native extinctions in the homogenization process was assessed by simulating the exclusion of threatened species in the data set.
   Location Parana River, south-eastern South America.
   Methods A fish species list of the Parana River Basin was organized in a subset of species distributions, according to pre- and post-introductions caused by the elimination of the natural barrier and by other mechanisms. Biotic homogenization was verified by the use of Jaccard's and Bray-Curtis's coefficients, Whittaker's beta diversity index, non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) and nonparametric tests.
   Results For all subsets of species distributions, we observed an increase in the number of non-native species in common related to the introductions. Between 40 and 52% of the species currently present in the Upper Parana Basin dispersed upstream from the Lower Parana after the construction of Itaipu Dam, including at least 1 class, 2 orders, 4 families and 16 genera of fish. Jaccard's coefficient between the Upper and Lower Parana River increased by 6-7.5% only considering the Itaipu Dam influence and 10.5% considering all mechanisms of fish introductions. More than 50% of the increase in similarity was caused by the elimination of the barrier. Our results indicated functional homogenization related to large-bodied Siluriformes (catfish).
   Main conclusions Itaipu Lake flooded a natural barrier and allowed hydrologic connectivity between the Upper and Lower Parana River, and many fishes of the lower part of the river were able to colonize the upper stretches. The homogenization of the two assemblages between these adjacent aquatic regions was an unpredicted result of hydropower implementation. Introductions by dam can also shift longitudinal and latitudinal body size patterns (i.e. Bergmann's rule).

AB Natural variation in the regulation of the accumulation of mineral nutrients and trace elements in plant tissues is crucial to plant metabolism, development, and survival across different habitats. Studies of the genetic basis of natural variation in nutrient metabolism have been facilitated by the development of ionomics. Ionomics is a functional genomic approach for the identification of the genes and gene networks that regulate the elemental composition, or ionome, of an organism. In this study, we evaluated the genetic basis of divergence in elemental composition between an inland annual and a coastal perennial accession of Mimulus guttatus using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population. Out of 20 elements evaluated, Mo and Cd were the most divergent in accumulation between the two accessions and were highly genetically correlated in the RILs across two replicated experiments. We discovered two major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Mo accumulation, the largest of which consistently colocalized with a QTL for Cd accumulation. Interestingly, both Mo QTLs also colocalized with the two M. guttatus homologues of MOT1, the only known plant transporter to be involved in natural variation in molybdate uptake.

Silva Fennica 46(5): 667-682. We aimed at evaluating the interacting effects of silvicultural and nursery practices on planted black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) dimensions, growth, survival and nutrition, 8 years following planting on a carefully logged boreal stand heavily invaded by Kalmia angustifolia L. and Rhododendron groenlandicum (Oeder) Kron & Judd. We also evaluated functional traits related to light and nutrient acquisition and key environmental resource availability to interpret treatment impacts on spruce seedling leaf traits and growth. An experimental black spruce plantation, consisting in a randomized block split-split-split plot design with 13 replicates was established in northeastern Quebec (Canada). Scarification (single-pass, double-pass), fertilization at the time of planting (control; macronutrients only; macro + micronutrients), stock type (container-grown; bare-root), and initial foliar N concentration (4 increasing levels) treatments were applied, and measurements were performed 5 and 8 years following planting. Double-pass scarification significantly increased soil temperature and reduced the competition cover, compared to the single-pass treatment. As a result, double-pass scarification promoted seedling growth over the single-pass treatment, and influenced the expression of other treatment effects. However, the relative gains associated with the second scarification pass have to be balanced against the supplemental investment involved by the treatment before being recommended. Our results point to variable effects of fertilization at planting to stimulate seedling initial growth. In this ecosystem, it appears that the silvicultural gains of this treatment depend on the variable of interest. Bare-root seedlings grew faster than containerized seedlings in the most intense site preparation treatment, but the differences have limited silvicultural impacts.

AB Invasive species are considered an increasing global threat to marine ecosystems. Understanding which factors can accelerate or reduce invasion success is one of the main goals of invasion ecology. The present study investigated the interactive effects of propagule pressure and native functional diversity on the invasion success of the invasive alga Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt over a 1 yr invasion process (i.e. settlement, recruitment and colonisation). The invasibility of macroalgal assemblages with different functional diversity was assessed under high and low propagule pressure. Synthetic assemblages resembling natural marine macroalgal assemblages were built and used as model systems. Recruitment discs were used to record early settlement in the assemblages. Recruitment and colonisation success were monitored in the field 2 and 10 mo after exposure to propagule rain in the laboratory. The availability of resources (space and photosynthetically active radiation [PAR]) was also monitored for each assemblage and used as predictive variables in the analyses. The effects of propagule pressure and functional diversity varied among the invasion stages. Space availability did not play a significant role in the recruitment success of the invader. However, PAR was a key resource in its invasion success. Overall, the invasion success of S. muticum was influenced differently by different traits of the recipient assemblages. Hence, invasion success may be better explained by the interaction of environmental factors that co-vary with species diversity and identity at different invasion stages.

AB Phytoplankton are major primary producers in aquatic ecosystems and are sensitive to various aspects of global environmental change. They can respond through phenotypic plasticity, species sorting, genetic adaptation, or a combination of these processes. Here we present conceptual, experimental and theoretical ways to predict different phytoplankton responses to global change. Using phytoplankton ecological niches to predict their responses to multiple environmental stressors is a promising new approach. Functional traits of phytoplankton, such as resource utilization traits and tolerance curves for various environmental factors like temperature, can be used to define niches along major axes. Characterization of pairwise and higher dimension trade-offs among traits should help predict possible niche changes along multiple dimensions simultaneously. The potential for evolutionary responses to global change can be assessed using evolution experiments with individual strains, as well as in communities, because the responses may depend on the presence of competitors, grazers, and parasites. The evolutionary pressures induced by multiple stressors may have interactive effects and, thus, should be investigated simultaneously. Novel models of trait evolution in a community context should provide additional insights into potential adaptation trajectories under diverse global change scenarios.

AB Plant height determines a species' position in the canopy and regulates access to light. Shifts in trait values for assemblages (plots) arrayed along abiotic gradients can reflect changes in species composition, and shifts in species trait values. Multivariate analysis was used to quantify the relationship of assemblage-level floristic composition to environmental gradients. Species trait values for maximum height, leaf area, seed size and wood density were quantified for woody species in the assemblage samples, and partitioned into within- and among-assemblage components to enable trait correlations to be identified, including in relation to abiotic gradients. Assemblages in upslope topographic positions had lower height, smaller leaves and higher wood density. Across the assemblages, shifts in species composition, decreasing canopy height and the position of smaller trees in the canopy were all linked to decreasing soil depth in upslope topographic positions. Regardless of stand height, the canopy position of most main canopy dominants remained largely unchanged in response to shifts in environmental gradients. In contrast, shorter-stature tree species retained height along the gradient and subsequently shifted from the subcanopy to the canopy as soil depth and site (plot) canopy height decreased. Within a community, height and position in the canopy can shift under differing environmental conditions.

AB As apex predators, chondrichthyans, or cartilaginous fishes, hold an important position within a range of aquatic ecosystems and influence the balance between species' abundance and biodiversity. Having been in existence for over 400 million years and representing the earliest stages of the evolution of jawed vertebrates, this group also covers a diverse range of eco-morphotypes, occupying both marine and freshwater habitats. The class Chondrichthyes is divided into two subclasses: the Elasmobranchii (sharks, skates, and rays) and the Holocephali (elephant sharks and chimaeras). However, many of their life history traits, such as low fecundity, the production of small numbers of highly precocious young, slow growth rates, and late maturity, make them highly susceptible to human exploitation. To mitigate the negative effects of human impacts, it is important that we understand the sensory strategies that elasmobranchs use for navigating within their environment, forming reproductive aggregations, feeding, and even communicating. One approach to investigate the sensory bases of their behavior is to examine the peripheral sense organs mediating vision, olfaction, gustation, lateral line, electroreception, and audition in a large range of species in order to identify specific adaptations, the range of sensitivity thresholds, and the compromise between sensory spatial resolution and sensitivity. In addition, we can quantitatively assess the convergence of sensory input to the central nervous system and the relative importance of different sensory modalities. Using a comparative approach and often a combination of anatomical, electrophysiological, and molecular techniques, significant variation has been identified in the spatial and chromatic sampling of the photoreceptors in the eye, the surface area and the number of olfactory lamellae within the nasal cavity, the level of gustatory sampling within the oral cavity, the type and innervation of neuromasts of the lateral line system, the distribution of electroreceptive pores over the head, and the morphology of the inner ear. These results are presented in the context of predictions of sensory capabilities for species living in a range of ecological niches, what further research is needed, and how this sensory input may be a predictor of behavior.

AB The aim of this study was to explore the differences between taxa groups with different ecological strategies for persistence, regarding their responses to environmental factors and seasonal variation. We studied the relationship between the seasonal patterns and habitat attributes of the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) and the Colepotera, Heteroptera (CH) assemblages. Sampling was carried out in May, July and October of 2009. Samples were taken according to the AQEM protocol at 10 stream sections in the Mecsek Mountains. Based on multivariate analyses (RDA, pRDA), distinctive differences were found between the EPT and the CH taxa groups regarding their response to local chemical variables and variables describing the riparian vegetation. The measured environmental variables had a higher relative influence on the distribution patterns of EPT and CH assemblages than spatial variation of species patterns. The physical structure of aquatic habitats, including the type of bedrock, had greater effects on CH than EPT patterns, whereas the structure of riparian vegetation was more important for EPT than CH. Average density and average taxon richness of EPT were seasonally variable, but CH assemblages were not.

AB This paper introduces new data on Todaropsis eblanae morphology, morphometry and functional aspects of the male reproductive system and hectocotylus. Spermatophores differ in specimens from the Atlantic Ocean (average length, 18.28 +/- 1.45 mm, 15.63 +/- 0.8% of mantle length; weight, 2.0-12.0 mg) and the Indian Ocean (average length, 24.8 +/- 2.85 mm, 16.9 +/- 2.1% of mantle length; weight, 35.0-39.6 mg) (t = 3.14; p < 0.01 for absolute sizes and t = 0.711; p > 001 for relative sizes). An additional important distinctive trait is the form of connection of the cement body with the ejaculatory tube. In recent years, T. eblanae has been regularly caught in the Barents Sea, meaning its range has extended to subarctic waters. The morphology and morphometry of the spermatophoric complex of organs did not vary in investigated parts of its range. Hectocotylus patterns and some important spermatophore traits distinguish Todaropsis from other Ommastrephidae.

AB Mixed beds of Ophiocomina nigra and Ophiothrix fragilis (Echinodermata, Ophiuroidea) are usually predominated by O. fragilis and are reported to be stable over time. The Bay of Brest (Brittany, France) is a highly productive ecosystem where both species co-occur in the main central part. Using a geostatistical approach, we tested for changes in O. nigra and O. fragilis density and total biomass patterns between 1987 and 2011. Our results highlighted an increase in O. nigra population size and the induction of a spatial shift of the co-occurring O. fragilis. O. nigra increased similar to 5 times in density and covered almost all the study area, while its density-dependent biomass increased similar to 3 times (22 t km(-2), ash-free dry mass) between 1987 and 2011. Overall, the O. fragilis population decreased in density by similar to 30%, but its total biomass did not change over time. The current distribution pattern revealed a clear spatial exclusion of O. fragilis from the central part of the study area toward the southern part, overlapping beds of dead slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata, which were formerly considered to be the dominant suspension-feeder species in the bay. The success of O. nigra colonization is linked to its biological and functional traits, as well as deep changes in food supply over the studied period. Ecological consequences of such a large change in the benthic compartment of the bay are explored in the light of associated changes in environmental patterns.

AB Ohio is an eastern USA state that historically was >70% covered in upland and mixed coniferous forest; about 60% of it glaciated by the Wisconsinan glacial episode. Its stonefly fauna has been studied in piecemeal fashion until now. The assemblage of Ohio stoneflies was assessed from over 4,000 records accumulated from 18 institutions, new collections, and trusted literature sources. Species richness totaled 102 with estimators Chao2 and ICE Mean predicting 105.6 and 106.4, respectively. Singletons and doubletons totaled 18 species. All North American families were represented with Perlidae accounted for the highest number of species at 34. The family Peltoperlidae contributed a single species. Most species had univoltine-fast life cycles with the vast majority emerging in summer, although there was a significant component of winter stoneflies. Nine United States Geological Survey hierarchical drainage units level 6 (HUC6) were used to stratify specimen data. Species richness was significantly related to the number of unique HUC6 locations, but there was no relationship with HUC6 drainage area. A nonparametric multidimensional scaling analysis found that larger HUC6s in the western part of the state had similar assemblages with lower species richness that were found to align with more savanna and wetland habitat. Other drainages having richer assemblages were aligned with upland deciduous and mixed coniferous forests of the east and south where slopes were higher. The Ohio assemblage was most similar to the well-studied fauna of Indiana (88 spp.) and Kentucky (108 spp.), two neighboring states. Many rare species and several high quality stream reaches should be considered for greater protection.

AB The seasonal variation of seston stable isotopes signature of carbon (delta C-13) in Lake Maggiore during 2008 was related to seasonal variation of the lake phytoplankton community, investigated in terms of phytoplankton taxonomic groups, morpho-functional groups (MBFG), cell size classes and cell shape classes. Three open water stations were selected to reflect truly pelagic, influenced by littoral and riverine carbon sources: phytoplankton samples were collected from two water depths, 0-20 m and 25-50 m. Among stations differences in delta C-13 signatures of seston were statistically non significant, confirming that allochthonous input may become important only after exceptional rainfall events. Nonparametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) was utilized to identify among the phytoplankton parameters (taxonomic groups, MBFG, cell shapes, cell sizes) which were the best predictors of the PC variation. Bacillariophyceae and two morpho-functional groups, Group 6 (non-flagellated organisms with siliceous exoskeletons) and Group 3 (large filamentous algae with aerotopes) were statistically significant. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination was used to investigate differences in phytoplankton samples and their relationship with delta C-13 variation. When morphological and functional phytoplankton traits were superimposed, the NMS ordination showed that cylinder cells (for cell shape classes), class 500-2000 mu m(3) (for cell size classes) and Group 6 (for MBFG) were the most related to delta C-13 variation. Our study confirms that the variation in the pelagic VC seston most probably reflects changes in phytoplankton carbon isotopic signature, consequent to changes in availability of carbon sources depending on the season and due to different isotopic fractionation of phytoplankton taxonomic groups. Statistical investigations have allowed us to investigate the potential role of phytoplankton morphological and functional traits in the seasonal variation of delta C-13 and to suggest their importance in the interpretation of natural stable isotopes studies in lake ecosystems.

AB Despite the great interest in characterizing the functional structure and resilience of functional groups in natural communities, few studies have examined in which way the roles and relationships of coexisting species change during community succession, a fundamental and natural process that follows the release of new resources in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Variation in algal traits that characterize different phases and stages of community succession on rocky shores are likely to influence the magnitude, direction of effects, and the level of redundancy and complementarity in the diverse assemblage of herbivores. Two separate field experiments were conducted to quantify per capita and population effects and the functional relationship (i.e., redundancy or complementarity) of four herbivore species found in central Chile during early and late algal succession. The first experiment examined grazer effects on the colonization and establishment of early-succession algal species. The second experiment examined effects on the late-successional, dominant corticated alga Mazzaella laminarioides. Complementary laboratory experiments with all species and under natural environmental conditions allowed us to further characterize the collective effects of these species. We found that, during early community succession, all herbivore species had similar effects on the ephemeral algae, ulvoids, but only during the phase of colonization. Once these algae were established, only a subset of the species was able to control their abundance. During late succession, only the keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa could control corticated Mazzaella. The functional relationships among these species changed dramatically from redundant effects on ephemeral algae during early colonization, to a more complementary role on established early-successional algae, to a dominant (i.e., keystone) effect on late succession. This study highlights that functional relationship within consumer assemblages can vary at different phases and times of community succession. Differentiation in herbivore roles emphasizes the need to evaluate consumer's impacts through different times of community succession, and through experimental manipulations to make even broad predictions about the resilience or vulnerability of diverse intertidal assemblages to human disturbances.

AB The functional diversity index has shown that the functional diversity of the macrobenthic community increased along a spatial gradient of distance from the Po river delta (Emilia-Romagna coast, Italy, North-Adriatic Sea), which suggests that riverine inputs have a detrimental effect on community functioning. This study focuses on two different depths along a southward gradient of increasing distance from the Po river delta where the Po river is the main source of freshwater and nutrient inputs in the North-Adriatic Sea. A Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) was used to examine a dataset of 156 soft-bottom macrobenthic species that were collected at eight stations in this area. Instead of comparing communities on the basis of their taxonomic composition, BTA uses a series of life history, morphological and behavioural characteristics of species to indicate aspects of their ecological functioning. The variability of the Emilia-Romagna dataset was governed by relatively few biological traits: growth form, trophic group, type of movement, habit, adult mobility and bioturbation activity. The community closer to the coastline was mainly composed of moderately mobile vermiform organisms with burrowing or tube-dwelling behaviour, and deposit feeding behaviour. However, the offshore community was mainly characterized by organisms with a laterally compressed or globose body and tube-dwelling behaviour; filter feeders and deposit feeders were dominant.

AB Research on suction-feeding performance has mostly focused on measuring individual underlying components such as suction pressure, flow velocity, ram or the effects of suction-induced forces on prey movement during feeding. Although this body of work has advanced our understanding of aquatic feeding, no consensus has yet emerged on how to combine all of these variables to predict prey-capture performance. Here, we treated the aquatic predator-prey encounter as a hydrodynamic interaction between a solid particle (representing the prey) and the unsteady suction flows around it, to integrate the effects of morphology, physiology, skull kinematics, ram and fluid mechanics on suction-feeding performance. We developed the suction-induced force-field (SIFF) model to study suction-feeding performance in 18 species of centrarchid fishes, and asked what morphological and functional traits underlie the evolution of feeding performance on three types of prey. Performance gradients obtained using SIFF revealed that different trait combinations contribute to the ability to feed on attached, evasive and (strain-sensitive) zooplanktonic prey because these prey types impose different challenges on the predator. The low overlap in the importance of different traits in determining performance also indicated that the evolution of suction-feeding ability along different ecological axes is largely unconstrained. SIFF also yielded estimates of feeding ability that performed better than kinematic traits in explaining natural patterns of prey use. When compared with principal components describing variation in the kinematics of suction-feeding events, SIFF output explained significantly more variation in centrarchid diets, suggesting that the inclusion of more mechanistic hydrodynamic models holds promise for gaining insight into the evolution of aquatic feeding performance.

I tested the hypothesis that aquatic predator diversity effects cascade to terrestrial food webs by altering a prey subsidy (biomass and trophic structure of emerging aquatic insects) entering terrestrial food webs, in turn altering the distribution of a terrestrial consumer (spider) that feeds on emerging aquatic insects. Fish presence, but not diversity, altered the trophic structure of emerging aquatic insects by strongly reducing the biomass of emerging predators (dragonflies) relative to non-feeding taxa (chironomid midges). Fish diversity reduced emerging insect biomass through enhanced effects on the most common prey taxa: predatory dragonflies Pantala flavescens and non-feeding chironomids. Terrestrial spiders (Tetragnathidae) primarily captured emerging chironomids, which were reduced in the high richness (3 spp.) treatment relative to the 1 and 2 species treatments. As a result, terrestrial spider abundance was lower above pools with high fish richness (3 species) than pools with 1 and 2 species. Synergistic predation effects were mostly limited to the high richness treatment, in which fish occupied each level of vertical microhabitat in the water-column (benthic, middle, surface). This study demonstrates that predator diversity effects are not limited to the habitat of the predator, but can propagate to adjacent ecosystems, and demonstrates the utility of using simple predator functional traits (foraging domain) to more accurately predict the direction of predator diversity effects.

AB The recovery of macrofaunal communities after marine aggregate dredging was assessed using both traditional indices (abundance, biomass and species diversity), and functional analysis techniques (Somatic Production, Taxonomic Distinctness, Infaunal Trophic Index, Biological Traits Analysis and Rao's Quadratic Entropy). A previously dredged area (Area 222). located off the southeast coast of England was selected for this investigation. Area 222 was split into sites that had been subjected to relatively high dredging intensity, relatively low dredging intensity, and undisturbed reference areas. Both traditional and functional analyses indicated that macrofauna at the low dredging intensity site had fully recovered at least 7 years after the dredging ceased. Recovery times at the high intensity site had a greater variability and most of the techniques recorded the recovery had yet to take place even 11 years after the dredging had ceased. Since Area 222 was dredged for a long period of time (approx. 25 years), it is suggested that a longer time series of study be carried out so that the definitive recovery period in this high intensity site can be determined. While a longer time series study is not always a realistic or cost effective, the present study could be useful to facilitate the selection of metrics to support in the assessment of macrofaunal recovery.

AB Recent advances in genomics have led to a dramatic upwards revision of marine microbial diversity and a greater appreciation of the important role evolutionary dynamics play in structuring microbial communities. This has presented a significant challenge to marine ecosystem models, which are traditionally diversity poor, and often do not include adaptive/evolutionary processes. Here we explore the use of evolutionary individual-based models (IBMs) as a means of addressing some of these issues. In the IBM, we associate a digital 4genome' with each agent, which codes for the phenotypic traits of simulated organisms. Random mutations at the point of reproduction then allow adaptation in response to changing environmental conditions. Trade-offs between different physiological parameters result in different growth strategies emerging under different forcing scenarios. As an idealised test-case we consider resource competition in a chemostat environment, and compare the individual-based approach to a more traditional population-level model. When run in a non-evolutionary context using a clonal population of agents, the IBM reproduces the results of the population-level model. With evolutionary processes enabled, optimally adapted agents are observed to rise to prominence within the agent population. Their physiological trait values are shown to compare well with theoretical optimal trait combinations derived using resource competition theory. In more variable environments, the model is also shown to capture adaptation in response to changed environmental conditions. We conclude that IBMs represent a useful framework for building detailed models linking (sub-)individual-level processes to emergent ecosystem-level behaviour in simplified 0- or 1-D representations of the environment, which should complement global marine ecosystem models of high spatial complexity but necessarily simple process representation.

AB We carried out an integrated analysis of ecosystem services in the Donana social-ecological system (southwestern Spain), from the providers (different aquatic plant functional groups) to the beneficiaries (different stakeholders living in or visiting the area). We explored the ecosystem services supplied by aquatic plants by linking these services to different plant functional traits, identifying relevant ecosystem services and then working our way backward to ecosystem properties and the functional traits underpinning them. We started from 15 ecosystem services associated with aquatic systems (freshwater marshes, salt marshes, ponds on aeolian sheets, temporal coastal ponds, and estuaries) and related them to plant traits (directly or indirectly through intermediate ecosystem properties). We gathered information from the literature on the functional traits of 144 plants occurring in the aquatic ecosystems of Donana. We analyzed the species x trait matrix with multivariate classification and ordination techniques and obtained seven functional groups with different potentials for delivering ecosystem services. A survey was then administered to 477 stakeholders to analyze, through the use of a contingent valuation exercise, how the ecosystem services provided by the different functional groups were valued. We identified connections between individual plant traits, ecosystem processes, and ecosystem services, but a mismatch appeared between the functional groups and the economic values placed on them by the beneficiaries. We found that contingent valuation applied to ecosystem services tended to ignore the ecosystem properties and biodiversity underpinning them. Our results cast doubts over the suitability of the economic valuation framework of ecosystem services to capture the full value of biodiversity and ecosystems to people.

AB Terrestrial invertebrates have been reported to be positively selected by stream salmonids. We assessed the importance of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates to salmonid diets in 25 streams in Finland, with the hypothesis that terrestrial prey would be important in only the smallest forest streams. Several measures of prey availability were used, including proportional abundance in benthic or drift samples, compared with a trait-based approach, to predict diet composition. Across all 25 streams in autumn, blackfly and caddis larvae were the most important prey items. Terrestrial invertebrates were of moderate importance in all streams, including the smallest. Pure availability predicted diet best and provided, in most cases, a significant fit with the observed diet. In a quantitative literature review, the mean proportion of terrestrial prey in salmonid diets was 17%, being highest for the largest fish (>= 15 cm). Species of the genus Salmo consumed significantly less terrestrials than did other salmonid genera. The proportion of terrestrial prey was highest in streams flowing through deciduous forests, but it was only weakly correlated with channel width.

AB Plant functional traits weighted by cover-abundance have been used to measure change across a wide range of temperature, moisture and grazing gradients. We use this approach along a chronosequence of disease infestation (Phytophthora cinnamomi) in the species-diverse Banksia woodlands of the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR). We compare the use of absolute (community-weighted totals-CWT) and relative cover data (community-weighted means-CWM) to demonstrate the importance of total cover change in reference to the Mass Ratio Hypothesis.
   Plant species cover-abundance was recorded along a space-for-time disease chronosequence, and functional trait data collected for the 48 dominant species from healthy vegetation. Six traits with deduced links to key ecosystem functions were measured for each species and values for two indices (CWT and CWM) compared along the disease chronosequence. Trait data was collected on plant height, growth form, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, root pattern and carbohydrate storage.
   Despite substantial shifts in individual species cover and a reduction in total species cover, the majority of CWM values did not change significantly following disease infestation. The use of relative cover-abundance data disregards important changes in total species cover, apparent from our comparative analysis. In contrast to CWMs, all CWT values were reduced following disease infestation, suggesting a potential reduction in productivity, reduced capacity as a carbon sink and altered site water balance. Verification of these potential changes in ecosystem functions is required using fine-scale quantitative techniques. The CWT index is complementary to traditional CWMs and useful when analysing changes in plant trait data where total species cover changes have been detected. In relation to P. cinnamomi infestation, shifts in CWT trait values indicate the ability of an introduced plant pathogen to have substantial indirect impacts beyond substantial floristic change.

AB 1. Most of the world's rivers are affected by dams and weirs. Information on the quantitative and qualitative effects of weirs across biological communities is crucial for successful management and restoration of stream ecosystems. Yet, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that have analysed the serial discontinuity in direct proximity of weirs including diverse taxonomic groups from algae to fish.
   2. This study compared the abiotic stream habitat characteristics upstream and downstream of weirs as well as their effects on the community structure of periphyton, aquatic macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fish at five different study rivers.
   3. Physicochemical habitat characteristics discriminated strongly between upstream and downstream sides of weirs in terms of water depth, current speed, substratum composition and the transition between free-flowing water and interstitial zone. Accordingly, abundance, diversity, community structure and functional ecological traits of all major taxonomic groups were indicative of serial discontinuity, but the discriminative power of individual taxonomic groups strongly differed between rivers.
   4. The simultaneous inclusion of abiotic habitat variables, taxonomic diversity and biological traits in multivariate non-metric multidimensional scaling was most comprehensive and powerful for the quantification of weir effects. In some cases, the intrastream discrimination induced by weirs exceeded the variation between geographically distant rivers of different geological origin and drainage systems. Community effects were generally detectable on high levels of taxonomic resolution such as family or order level.
   5. Synthesis and applications. River sections in spatial proximity to weirs are affected seriously and should be included in the ecological assessments of the European Water Framework Directive. Multivariate models that include several taxonomic groups and physicochemical habitat variables provide a universally applicable tool for the ecological assessment of impacts on serial discontinuity and other stressors on stream ecosystem health.

AB The production of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) is widely distributed within the marine Roseobacter clade, and it was proposed that AHL-mediated quorum sensing (QS) is one of the most common cell-to-cell communication mechanisms in roseobacters. The traits regulated by AHL-mediated QS are yet not known for members of the Roseobacter clade, but production of the antibiotic tropodithietic acid (TDA) was supposed to be controlled by AHL-mediated QS in Phaeobacter spp. We describe here for the first time the functional role of luxR and luxI homologous genes of an organism of the Roseobacter clade, i.e., pgaR and pgaI in Phaeobacter gallaeciensis. Our results demonstrate that the AHL synthase gene pgaI is responsible for production of N-3-hydroxydecanoylhomoserine lactone (3OHC(10)-HSL). Insertion mutants of pgaI and pgaR are both deficient in TDA biosynthesis and the formation of a yellow-brown pigment when grown in liquid marine broth medium. This indicates that in P. gallaeciensis the production of both secondary metabolites is controlled by AHL-mediated QS. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the transcription level of tdaA, which encodes an essential transcriptional regulator for TDA biosynthesis, decreased 28- and 51-fold in pgaI and pgaR genetic backgrounds, respectively. These results suggest that both the response regulator PgaR and the 3OHC10-HSL produced by PgaI induce expression of tdaA, which in turn positively regulates expression of the tda genes. Moreover, we confirmed that TDA can also act as autoinducer in P. gallaeciensis, as previously described for Silicibacter sp. strain TM1040, but only in the presence of the response regulator PgaR.

AB High quality monitoring data are vital for tracking and understanding the causes of ecosystem change. We present a potentially powerful approach for phytoplankton and aquatic ecosystem monitoring, based on integration of scanning flow-cytometry for the characterization and counting of algal cells with multiparametric vertical water profiling. This approach affords high-frequency data on phytoplankton abundance, functional traits and diversity, coupled with the characterization of environmental conditions for growth over the vertical structure of a deep water body. Data from a pilot study revealed effects of an environmental disturbance event on the phytoplankton community in Lake Lugano (Switzerland), characterized by a reduction in cytometry-based functional diversity and by a period of cyanobacterial dominance. These changes were missed by traditional limnological methods, employed in parallel to high-frequency monitoring. Modeling of phytoplankton functional diversity revealed the importance of integrated spatiotemporal data, including circadian time-lags and variability over the water column, to understand the drivers of diversity and dynamic processes. The approach described represents progress toward an automated and trait-based analysis of phytoplankton natural communities. Streamlining of high-frequency measurements may represent a resource for understanding, modeling and managing aquatic ecosystems under impact of environmental change, yielding insight into processes governing phytoplankton community resistance and resilience.

AB Species are often grouped according to their biological or functional traits to better understand their contribution to ecosystem functioning. However, it is becoming clear that a single species can perform different roles in different habitats. Austrohelice crassa, a burrow-building mud crab shifts its primary bioturbational role to that of a vertical mixer in non-cohesive sediments as frequent burrow collapse greatly enhances sediment reworking. We conducted in situ crab density manipulations in two sediment environments (a non-cohesive sand and a cohesive muddy-sand) to examine if the context-specific functional roles were linked to changes in solute fluxes across the sediment-water interface. Across both habitats, we show that A. crassa regulated nutrient cycling, creating strong density driven effects on solute exchanges. Increasing crab density increased sediment O-2 demand and the flux of NH4+ from the sediment, indicating much of the response was physiologically driven. Clear interactions between A. crassa and microphytobenthos were also detected in both habitats. Despite lowering microphyte standing stock through deposit feeding, A. crassa increased benthic primary production per unit of chlorophyll a. Our experiment also revealed important context-specific differences, most notably for NH4+ fluxes, which were higher where burrows and their associated microbial communities were most stable (muddy-sand). This study highlights the need to integrate interactions between organism behavior and habitat type into functional group studies to broaden conceptual frameworks and avoid oversimplification of highly complex organism-sediment interactions.

AB Trade-offs among functional traits are essential for explaining community structure and species coexistence. While two-way trade-offs have been investigated in many systems, higher-dimensional trade-offs remain largely hypothetical. Here we demonstrate a three-way trade-off between cell size and competitive abilities for nitrogen and phosphorus in marine and freshwater phytoplankton. At a given cell size, competitive abilities for N and P are negatively correlated, but as cell size increases, competitive ability decreases for both nutrients. The relative importance of the two trade-off axes appears to be environment dependent, suggesting different selective pressures: freshwater phytoplankton separate more along the N vs. P competition axis, and marine phytoplankton separate more along the nutrient competition vs. cell size axis. Our results demonstrate the multidimensional nature of key trade-offs among traits and suggest that such trade-offs may drive species interactions and structure ecological communities.

AB Identification of tradeoffs among physiological and morphological traits and their use in cost-benefit models and ecological or evolutionary optimization arguments have been hallmarks of ecological analysis for at least 50 years. Carnivorous plants are model systems for studying a wide range of ecophysiological and ecological processes and the application of a cost-benefit model for the evolution of carnivory by plants has provided many novel insights into trait-based cost-benefit models. Central to the cost-benefit model for the evolution of botanical carnivory is the relationship between nutrients and photosynthesis; of primary interest is how carnivorous plants efficiently obtain scarce nutrients that are supplied primarily in organic form as prey, digest and mineralize them so that they can be readily used, and allocate them to immediate versus future needs. Most carnivorous plants are terrestrial-they are rooted in sandy or peaty wetland soils-and most studies of cost-benefit tradeoffs in carnivorous plants are based on terrestrial carnivorous plants. However approximately 10% of carnivorous plants are unrooted aquatic plants. Here we ask whether the cost-benefit model applies equally well to aquatic carnivorous plants and what general insights into tradeoff models are gained by this comparison. Nutrient limitation is more pronounced in terrestrial carnivorous plants, which also have much lower growth rates and much higher ratios of dark respiration to photosynthetic rates than aquatic carnivorous plants. Phylogenetic constraints on ecophysiological tradeoffs among carnivorous plants remain unexplored. Despite differences in detail, the general cost-benefit framework continues to be of great utility in understanding the evolutionary ecology of carnivorous plants. We provide a research agenda that if implemented would further our understanding of ecophysiological tradeoffs in carnivorous plants and also would provide broader insights into similarities and differences between aquatic and terrestrial plants of all types.

AB Cultivated psychropiezophilic (low-temperature- and high-pressure-adapted) bacteria are currently restricted to phylogenetically narrow groupings capable of growth under nutrient-replete conditions, limiting current knowledge of the extant functional attributes and evolutionary constraints of diverse microorganisms inhabiting the cold, deep ocean. This study documents the isolation of a deep-sea bacterium following dilution-to-extinction cultivation using a natural seawater medium at high hydrostatic pressure and low temperature. To our knowledge, this isolate, designated PRT1, is the slowest-growing (minimal doubling time, 36 h) and lowest cell density-producing (maximal densities of 5.0 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)) piezophile yet obtained. Optimal growth was at 80 MPa, correlating with the depth of capture (8,350 m), and 10 degrees C, with average cell sizes of 1.46 mu m in length and 0.59 mu m in width. Through detailed growth studies, we provide further evidence for the temperature-pressure dependence of the growth rate for deep-ocean bacteria. PRT1 was phylogenetically placed within the Roseobacter clade, a bacterial lineage known for widespread geographic distribution and assorted lifestyle strategies in the marine environment. Additionally, the gene transfer agent (GTA) g5 capsid protein gene was amplified from PRT1, indicating a potential mechanism for increased genetic diversification through horizontal gene transfer within the hadopelagic environment. This study provides a phylogenetically novel isolate for future investigations of high-pressure adaptation, expands the known physiological traits of cultivated members of the Roseobacter lineage, and demonstrates the feasibility of cultivating novel microbial members from the deep ocean using natural seawater.

AB The intertidal crabs Neohelice granulata and Cyrtograpsus angulatus are common on the south-west Atlantic coast but they rarely share the same microhabitat. They are similar in size and in several life history traits which promote competition. Neohelice granulata is the dominant species in intertidal soft-sediment and salt-marsh areas from southern Brazil to northern Patagonia Argentina, where it forms extensive burrowing beds. Its burrowing activity affects sediment characteristics as well as the infaunal community. When both species coexist N. granulata constrains the distribution and modifies some population characteristics and burrowing behaviour of C. angulatus. However, C. angulatus live in burrows forming dense burrowing beds in soft-bottom intertidal areas where N. granulata is absent. Where both species coexist, C. angulatus rarely constructs burrows and N. granulata clearly dominate soft-sediment areas forming conspicuous burrowing beds. This suggests that these crab species could have similar ecological roles in some effects on sediments related to burrowing activities. In this study, we experimentally compare their effects on sediment characteristics and infaunal community. The results of the experiment showed that C. angulatus modify sediment water and organic matter contents and grain size-frequency distributions similarly to N. granulata. Neither N. granulata nor C. angulatus affected the mean abundance of infaunal organisms during the experiment but their variances showed the same patterns in many cases, indicating similar effects. These results indicate that C. angulatus can modify sediment characteristics similarly to N. granulata, and has similar interactions with infaunal species.

   DUPLICATION
AB The preovulatory hydration of teleost oocytes is a unique process among vertebrates. The hydration mechanism is most pronounced in marine acanthomorph teleosts that spawn pelagic (floating) eggs; however, the molecular pathway for water influx remains poorly understood. Recently, we revealed that whole-genome duplication (WGD) resulted in teleosts harboring the largest repertoire of molecular water channels in the vertebrate lineage and that a duplicated aquaporin-1 paralog is implicated in the oocyte hydration process. However, the origin and function of the aquaporin-1 paralogs remain equivocal. By integrating the molecular phylogeny with synteny and structural analyses, we show here that the teleost aqp1aa and -1ab paralogs (previously annotated as aqp1a and -1b, respectively) arose by tandem duplication rather than WGD and that the Aqp1ab C-terminus is the most rapidly evolving subdomain within the vertebrate aquaporin superfamily. The functional role of Aqp1ab was investigated in Atlantic halibut, a marine acanthomorph teleost that spawns one of the largest pelagic eggs known. We demonstrate that Aqp1ab is required for full hydration of oocytes undergoing meiotic maturation. We further show that the rapid structural divergence of the C-terminal regulatory domain causes ex vivo loss of function of halibut Aqp1ab when expressed in amphibian oocytes but not in zebrafish or native oocytes. However, by using chimeric constructs of halibut Aqp1aa and -1ab and antisera specifically raised against the C-terminus of Aqp1ab, we found that this cytoplasmic domain regulates in vivo trafficking to the microvillar portion of the oocyte plasma membrane when intraoocytic osmotic pressure is at a maximum. Interestingly, by coinjecting polyA(+) mRNA from postvitellogenic halibut follicles, ex vivo intracellular trafficking of Aqp1ab is rescued in amphibian oocytes. These data reveal that the physiological role of Aqp1ab during meiosis resumption is conserved in teleosts, but the remarkable degeneracy of the cytoplasmic domain has resulted in alternative regulation of the trafficking mechanism.

AB 1. Reinstating more natural water regimes is often a priority intervention to rehabilitate wetlands that have been degraded through anthropogenic changes to their natural wetting and drying cycles. Hydrological interventions are often made in chronically desiccated wetlands but less commonly in wetlands that have been permanently inundated and that require a drawdown phase for rehabilitation. Reports on the effectiveness of reinstating a drawdown phase in chronically inundated wetlands are particularly rare.
   2. We undertook a landscape-scale, experimental drawdown of water levels at Dowd Morass, a large, Ramsar-listed, brackish-water wetland in south-eastern Australia that had been artificially flooded for 30+ years. During the hydrological manipulation, c. 500 ha of the wetland was drawn down and re-flooded, and the remaining c. 1000 ha was used as a control site. Fringing areas with a fluctuating water regime were used as a reference site. Results were analysed in terms of gradient analysis, by classifying the different water regimes created by the hydrological interventions. The response of wetland vegetation was measured along replicated transects over a 4-year period, before, during and after drawdown. Wetland plants were assigned to plant functional groups for analysis. Assembly theory and knowledge of life-history traits were used to predict that drawdown would promote recruitment of plant species that required exposed sediment for germination and seedling establishment.
   3. Within-wetland microtopography interacted with the hydrological interventions to generate three distinct water regimes, which were differentiated by the spatial extent of exposed sediment and duration of the dry period. Drawdown promoted limited recruitment of some plant species, and the survival of cohorts then depended strongly on the extent and duration of the dry period. Species richness and vegetation cover (understorey and overstorey) continued to decline in constantly flooded areas of the wetland. Increased salinisation of sediments and surface waters reduced the effectiveness of the drawdown and dramatically affected species richness and cover of aquatic vegetation, which did not recover fully when fresher conditions returned.
   4. The capacity of vegetation to respond to the reinstatement of a drawdown cycle following chronic inundation was constrained by abiotic (e. g. salinity) and biotic (e. g. depauperate seedbanks) factors. Reinstating a dry phase in chronically inundated, brackish-water wetlands is complex and risky and may not effectively improve vegetation condition in the short term. In the case of Dowd Morass, rehabilitation was most successful in sites that had been shallowly flooded prior to drawdown and that remained dry for longest.

AB Habitat template models that integrate physical, chemical, and biological data have the potential to explain geographic variation in life-history traits within assemblages and to predict locations where species will be most vulnerable to anthropogenic impact. A previously developed model based on spatial variations in scope for growth (SG) and natural disturbance (ND) for the Scotian Shelf/Bay of Fundy was tested for its ability to predict fish life-history traits, species diversity, and community composition using trawl survey data. Of 30 dominant fish species, large, slow-growing ones most vulnerable to overexploitation tended to be found in naturally stable habitats. Among consistently co-occurring groups, functional differentiation, rather than similarity of life history, characterized assemblages, whereas among survey strata, species richness peaked at intermediate levels of ND and species evenness increased with average SG. Community composition was significantly correlated with both habitat variables, declined by 40% through time preceding structural changes on the eastern Scotian Shelf, but geographic distance, depth, and bottom temperature remained more strongly related to composition. The results revealed compelling matches between template predictions and patterns of fish species diversity, but low variation in diversity of life history, and mobility of fish may account for some of the weaker matches to model predictions.

AB The ability to develop reversible dermal extensions on the lower jaw in some South American characiform fishes has been proposed as a way to optimize the performance of aquatic surface respiration (ASR) during hypoxic conditions. These structures are formed by edema of the hypodermal tissues and can develop in a large proportion of individuals inhabiting a lake within a few hours following daily changes in dissolved oxygen. Our study report the development of dermal lip protuberances in eleven species of characiform fishes associated with periods of strong environmental hypoxia in floodplain lakes of Salado River, Argentina. Protuberances occurred in different basic forms in fishes with divergent head morphology (genera Astyanax, Ctenobrycon, Aphyocharax, Brycon, Mylossoma, Triportheus, Oligosarcus and Acestrorhynchus). The discovery of dermal projections on the anterior border of maxillary bone extends the known range of structures affected by lip protuberances. Dermal structures began to develop simultaneously in both jaws below dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations of 1.20-1.75 mgl(-1) and rose in a steep manner as oxygen level decreased. The degree of morphological plasticity differed among traits and species. The shape of response of morphology to DO was similar to that previously reported on ASR, providing additional evidence about the functional link between these traits. Our results suggests that dermal lip protuberances are widely spread among characiform fishes, affecting several mouth structures. The different types of protuberances would make up for the limitations imposed by body size and mouth shape and position on the performance of ASR in fishes with divergent morphology.

AB Hagfishes (Myxinidae), a family of jawless marine pre-vertebrates, hold a unique evolutionary position, sharing a joint ancestor with the entire vertebrate lineage. They are thought to fulfil primarily the ecological niche of scavengers in the deep ocean. However, we present new footage from baited video cameras that captured images of hagfishes actively preying on other fish. Video images also revealed that hagfishes are able to choke their would-be predators with gill-clogging slime. This is the first time that predatory behaviour has been witnessed in this family, and also demonstrates the instantaneous effectiveness of hagfish slime to deter fish predators. These observations suggest that the functional adaptations and ecological role of hagfishes, past and present, might be far more diverse than previously assumed. We propose that the enduring success of this oldest extant family of fishes over 300 million years could largely be due to their unique combination of functional traits.

AB DNA barcoding has unraveled issues. related to cryptic species complexes, assigning life history stages of unidentified organisms and also towards better understanding of evolutionary relationships between organismal groups. Given the advantages of DNA barcoding, one can strongly argue that barcodes may prove to be extremely useful for marine meiobenthic studies particularly for taxonomic groups such as free-living marine nematodes and polychaetes from the Indian subcontinent. An integrative taxonomic approach based on morphological traits based taxonomy and DNA barcoding would be ideal for studying the meiobenthic groups from Indian sedimentary environments.

AB Climate change and associated glacial recession create new stream habitat that leads to the assembly of new riverine communities through primary succession. However, there are still very few studies of the patterns and processes of community assembly during primary succession for stream ecosystems. We illustrate the rapidity with which biotic communities can colonize and establish in recently formed streams by examining Stonefly Creek in Glacier Bay, Alaska (USA), which began to emerge from a remnant glacial ice mass between 1976 and 1979. By 2002, 57 macroinvertebrate and 27 microcrustacea species had become established. Within 10 years of the stream's formation, pink salmon and Dolly Varden charr colonized, followed by other fish species, including juvenile red and silver salmon, Coast Range sculpin, and sticklebacks. Stable-isotope analyses indicate that marine-derived nitrogen from the decay of salmon carcasses was substantially assimilated within the aquatic food web by 2004. The findings from Stonefly Creek are compared with those from a long-term study of a similarly formed but older stream (12 km to the northeast) to examine possible similarities in macroinvertebrate community and biological trait composition between streams at similar stages of development. Macroinvertebrate community assembly appears to have been initially strongly deterministic owing to low water temperature associated with remnant ice masses. In contrast, microcrustacean community assembly appears to have been more stochastic. However;as stream age and water temperature increased, macroinvertebrate colonization was also more stochastic, and taxonomic similarity between Stonefly Creek and a stream at the same stage of development was <50%. However the most abundant taxa were similar, and functional diversity of the two communities was almost identical. Tolerance is suggested as the major mechanism of community assembly. The rapidity with which salmonids and invertebrate communities have become established across an entire watershed has implications for the conservation of biodiversity in freshwater habitats.

AB The transition from marine to freshwater life in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is accompanied by complex morphological changes-including reduction in bony armor and change in body shape-but experimental evidence for the selective agents behind these evolutionary transitions is sparse. We investigated whether selection by predatory fish affects threespine stickleback morphology differentially when refuge is absent (pelagic lifestyle-ancestral condition) or present (benthic lifestyle-derived condition). Our results show that selection favors low numbers of lateral plates in habitats with refuge, whereas fully plated individuals have a selective advantage in habitats without refuge. We also found that a decrease in the length of the caudal peduncle increased survival probability, irrespective of habitat. The effect of spine lengths on survival was evident only in a multivariate analysis of selection, implying that it is essential to account for phenotypic and genetic correlations between traits before drawing conclusions about the effects of selection on single traits. Apart from uncovering targets and patterns of predator-induced selection on threespine stickleback morphology, our results provide direct evidence to support the hypothesis that differences in antipredator strategies in pelagic versus benthic sticklebacks could play a role in the repeated, independent cases of plate number reduction following freshwater colonization in this species.

Although two-species mutualisms are found in all types of ecosystems, the study of their ecological influences on other community members has mostly been limited to third species, while their influence on entire communities remains largely unexplored.
   2. We hypothesized that mutualistic interactions between two respective ant species and an epiphyte mediate the biological traits composition of entire invertebrate communities that use the same host plant, thereby affecting food webs and functional diversity at the community level.
   3. Aechmea mertensii (Bromeliaceae) is both a phytotelm ('plant-held water') and an ant-garden epiphyte. We sampled 111 bromeliads (111 aquatic invertebrate communities) associated with either the ant Pachycondyla goeldii or Camponotus femoratus. The relationships between ants, bromeliads and invertebrate abundance data were examined using a redundancy analysis. Biological traits information for invertebrates was structured using a fuzzy-coding technique, and a co-inertia analysis between traits and abundance data was used to interpret functional differences in bromeliad ecosystems.
   4. The vegetative traits of A. mertensii depended on seed dispersion by C. femoratus and P. goeldii along a gradient of local conditions. The ant partner selected sets of invertebrates with traits that were best adapted to the bromeliads' morphology, and so the composition of the biological traits of invertebrate phytotelm communities depends on the identity of the ant partner. Biological traits suggest a bottom-up control of community structure in C. femoratus-associated phytotelmata and a greater structuring role for predatory invertebrates in P. goeldii-associated plants.
   5. This study presents new information showing that two-species mutualisms affect the functional diversity of a much wider range of organisms. Most biological systems form complex networks where nodes (e. g. species) are more or less closely linked to each other, either directly or indirectly, through intermediate nodes. Our observations provide community-level information about biological interactions and functional diversity, and perspectives for further observations intended to examine whether large-scale changes in interacting species/community structure over broad geographical and anthropogenic gradients affect ecosystem functions.

AB 1. In studies of an organism's functional ecology, key behavioural traits such as foraging periodicity are assumed to be uniform across the species. In particular, the fundamental division between diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns is usually assumed to be a fixed one, with organisms demonstrating physiological traits optimised for a particular diel rhythm.
   2. In this study, we explore the activity rhythm of a tropical reef fish, the golden-lined rabbitfish, Siganus lineatus. We make use of acoustic telemetry (manual tracking), combined with underwater observations of feeding behaviour to investigate the diel foraging patterns of S. lineatus, at three sites around the lagoon of Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef.
   3. We found significant differences in the activity patterns of shoreline and reef-based populations of S. lineatus. Individuals inhabiting the boulder-shoreline site foraged during the day and remained stationary in rest holes during the night, whereas individuals from the two reef populations foraged only during nocturnal hours, remaining stationary at the edge of favoured coral bommies during the day. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a wholesale intraspecific shift in diel activity rhythm for a tropical marine fish.
   4. We suggest that S. lineatus is a diurnal nominal herbivore whose biological rhythm has developed the flexibility to be nocturnal. This development may simply represent the masking effects of predation, competition or ontogeny, or it may represent entrainment over an evolutionary time-scale necessary to enable the species to expand its range into the coral reef environment.
   5. Either way, the results identify S. lineatus as a potential subject for research into the relative importance of the various biological forces driving divisions along the temporal niche axis and suggest that the species has the potential to provide insights into the impact of biological rhythm plasticity on ecosystem functioning at the ecological and evolutionary level.

AB This paper quantifies the impacts of two invasive species, Rapana venosa (Gastropoda, Muricidae) and Corbicula fluminea (Bivalvia, Corbiculidae), in the food web of the Rio de la Plata estuary and adjacent nearshore oceanic ecosystem. We analyzed certain functional traits of these mollusks assessed by a mass balance trophic model previously constructed for the years 2005-2007. This model incorporates 37 functional groups: three marine mammals species, one coastal bird, 17 fishes, 12 invertebrates, two zooplankton, one phytoplankton, and detritus. The model also includes 5 fishing fleets operating in the area. The results showed that the two invasive species affect multiple ecosystem components both directly and indirectly. R. venosa and the whitemouth croaker, Micropogonias furnieri, exhibited a high level of niche overlap (91%), while C. fluminea exhibited a high level of niche overlap with Mytilidae (94%), which suggests in both cases high levels of competition for similar resources. R. venosa had mixed trophic impacts but exhibited a predominantly top down effect on most bivalves. R. venosa could be a threat to natural resources in the area including to the fishing fleets. C. fluminea negatively influenced phytoplankton and detritus biomass and its positive effects on higher trophic level groups suggest a central bottom-up role in the food web as a bentho-pelagic coupler. Both species had negative impacts on the five fleets modeled, showing that the effects of these invasive species could extend to the socio-economic sector.

AB We isolated eleven strains of the harmful algal bloom (HAB)-forming dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum during a bloom event in the NW Mediterranean coastal waters and we studied the inter-strain variability in several of their physiological and biochemical traits. These included autotrophic growth parameters, feeding capabilities (mixotrophy), lipid composition, and, in some cases, their responses to biotic and abiotic factors. The strains were found to differ in their growth rates (0.27-0.53 d(-1)) and in the maximum cell concentrations achieved during stationary phase (6.1 x 10(4)-8.6 x 10(4) cells mL(-1)). Their ingestion performance, when offered Rhodomonas salina as prey, was also diverse (0.22-1.3 cells per K. veneficum per day: 8-52% of their daily ration). At least two strains survived for several months under strict heterotrophic conditions (no light, low inorganic nutrients availability, and R. sauna as food source). These strains also showed very distinct fatty acid compositions, with very low contents of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. According to a Bray Curtis similarity analysis, three or four strain groups able to perform different roles in bloom development were identified. We further analyzed one strain from each of the two most distinct groups with respect to prey concentration, light intensity, nutrient availability, and we determined the functional responses (growth and feeding rates) to food concentration. Taken together, the results served to highlight the role of mixotrophy and clone variability in the formation of HABs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, locally known as the "loco", is the main target species of the benthonic Chilean fisheries. Genetic and genomic tools are necessary to study the genome of this species in order to understand the molecular basis of its development, growth, and other key traits to improve the management strategies and to identify local adaptation to prevent loss of biodiversity. Here, we use pyrosequencing technologies to generate the first transcriptomic database from adult specimens of the loco. After trimming, a total of 140,756 Expressed Sequence Tag sequences were achieved. Clustering and assembly analysis identified 19,219 contigs and 105,435 singleton sequences. BlastN analysis showed a significant identity with Expressed Sequence Tags of different gastropod species available in public databases. Similarly, BlastX results showed that only 895 out of the total 124,654 had significant hits and may represent novel genes for marine gastropods. From this database, simple sequence repeat motifs were also identified and a total of 38 primer pairs were designed and tested to assess their potential as informative markers and to investigate their cross-species amplification in different related gastropod species. This dataset represents the first publicly available 454 data for a marine gastropod endemic to the southeastern Pacific coast, providing a valuable transcriptomic resource for future efforts of gene discovery and development of functional markers in other marine gastropods.

AB Endemic New Zealand frogs of the genus Leiopelma are from a basal lineage of extant anurans that release defensive secretions onto their skin when disturbed. Here, we characterize the gross anatomy and microscopic structure of the skin of L. archeyi, L. hochstetteri, and L. pakeka using stereoscopic, light and transmission electron microscopy. The terrestrial L. archeyi and L. pakeka possess dimorphic granular glands, categorized as type I and II, based on their frequency and morphological traits, whereas the semi-aquatic L. hochstetteri lacks type I glands. This is the first report of differential dimorphism in anurans of the same genus. This dimorphism could be interpreted as an adaptation to different physiological or ecological needs of these species. However, species within this ancient genus share similar general gland morphology with other anurans, namely, a secretory unit containing storage granules ensheathed by myoepithelial cells. Type I glands are ellipsoid, large and contain a homogeneous mass of electron-dense granules (1.8 +/- 0.08 mu m in diameter). Type II glands are round and contain larger heterogeneous granules (4.06 +/- 0.16 mu m) of varying densities. Exposure to noradrenaline causes the contraction of myoepithelial cells, resulting in bulk discharge of type I glands through the epidermal duct onto the skin surface. Differential release of secretions from dimorphic glands may be indicative of their functional specialisation in antipredatory or regulative roles. Mass spectrometric techniques were used to de novo sequence peptides present in the skin secretions of Leiopelma species. A total of 30 previously undescribed peptides from Leiopelma species were fully or partially sequenced. These peptides exhibited no similarity to any known compounds. J.

AB Aims
   Salt stress resulting from soil salinization is one of the driving forces of the land degradation throughout the world. The modern Yellow River delta is one of the most saline areas in China. Phytoremediation can be an effective way to restore the salinized ecosystems, which requires selecting appropriate plant species. This study explored the germination responses of common plant species from contrasting habitats in the Yellow River delta to varying salinity, offering experimental information for ecosystem restoration in the Yellow River delta.
   Methods
   In this study, 15 common plant species from the Yellow River delta were divided into two groups (high-salinity and low-salinity groups) by their natural habitats using Canonical Correlation Analysis. Seeds of each species were treated with five salinity levels (0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 ppt), using a randomized complete block design, and germinated seeds were counted and removed daily for 28 days to calculate the final germination proportion and mean time to germination. The germination responses of seeds to salinity treatments were compared between the two groups.
   Important Findings
   In relation to salinity, seed germination behavior of the test species was closely related to the salinity level of the habitats over which they were distributed. Species from the habitats with higher salinity had generally higher final germination proportion but shorter mean time to germination than those from the habitats with lower salinity in all of five salinity treatments used. The final germination proportion and mean time to germination of low-salinity group species were more sensitive to salinity than those of high-salinity group species. Selecting the species with high final germination proportion and short mean time to germination is important for restoration of salinized land.

AB Benthic communities show changes in composition and structure across different environmental characteristics and habitats. However, incorporating species biological traits into the analysis can provide a better understanding of system functioning within habitats. We compare the functional diversity of macrobenthic communities from a contrasting shallow (15 m) and deep (50 m) sublittoral soft-sediment habitats in northern Chile, using biological traits analysis. Our aim was to highlight the biological characteristics responsible for differences between habitats and the implications for ecosystem functioning. Trait analysis showed that the deep habitat was restricted in providing functionally important biogenic structure and bioturbation and supports less diverse feeding-related energy pathways. The shallow habitat is characterized by more diverse energy pathways and a higher potential for matter exchange through bioturbation. We provide support to the predictions of transfer of energy from the benthos to upper trophic levels in the shallow, which is characterized mainly by normoxia and little organic matter content in the sediment. In the deep habitat, characterized by hypoxia and more organic matter, energy appears to be transferred to microbial components. We suggest that trait analysis should be added to the traditional approaches based on species diversity, because it provides indicators of ecosystem stress.

AB Climate change exerts direct effects on ecosystems but has additional indirect effects due to changes in agricultural practice. These include the increased use of pesticides, changes in the areas that are cultivated, and changes in the crops cultivated. It is well known that pesticides, and in particular insecticides, affect aquatic ecosystems adversely. To implement effective mitigation measures it is necessary to identify areas that are affected currently and those that will be affected in the future. As a consequence, we predicted potential exposure to insecticide (insecticide runoff potential, RP) under current conditions (1990) and under a model scenario of future climate and land use (2090) using a spatially explicit model on a continental scale, with a focus on Europe. Space-for-time substitution was used to predict future levels of insecticide application, intensity of agricultural land use, and cultivated crops. To assess the indirect effects of climate change, evaluation of the risk of insecticide exposure was based on a trait-based, climate-insensitive indicator system (SPEAR, SPEcies At Risk). To this end, RP and landscape characteristics that are relevant for the recovery of affected populations were combined to estimate the ecological risk (ER) of insecticides for freshwater communities. We predicted a strong increase in the application of, and aquatic exposure to, insecticides under the future scenario, especially in Central and Northern Europe. This, in turn, will result in a severe increase in ER in these regions. Hence, the proportion of stream sites adjacent to arable land that do not meet the requirements for good ecological status as defined by the EU Water Framework Directive will increase (from 33% to 39% for the EU-25 countries), in particular in the Scandinavian and Baltic countries (from 6% to 19%). Such spatially explicit mapping of risk enables the planning of adaptation and mitigation strategies including vegetated buffer strips and nonagricultural recolonization zones along streams.

AB The expression of phenotypically plastic traits in prey organisms, triggered by changes in the abundance of their predators, is customarily assumed to involve costs in some fitness components such as fecundity, growth or survival. However, these plastic responses may also have an interaction cost, which is assessed by the strength of interspecific interactions such as increased vulnerability to other predators or a reduction in competitive ability. This study assesses experimentally the effects of induced morphological defenses triggered by the carnivorous rotifer Asplanchna brightwelli, on the competitive ability of two herbivorous populations, and the reciprocal dominance between the rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus and Brachionus havanaensis. Our results support the existence of a trade-off between the expression of induced morphological defenses and competitive ability in aquatic animals. Specifically, we show that: (i) a consumer which reduces its vulnerability to predation via induced defenses increases its resource requirement to maintain zero population growth; and (ii) the expression of induced defenses promotes a qualitative shift in the relative competitive performance of the two herbivores over a single resource gradient. These results reinforce the general idea of functional community consequences of phenotypic plasticity, in particular the expression of inducible defenses of prey.

AB Quantitative biological assessment protocols are needed for monitoring river status and evaluating river rehabilitation efforts. We conducted a standardized macroinvertebrate survey at 100 sites on 38 nonwadeable rivers in Wisconsin to construct, test, and apply an index of biotic integrity (IBI) intended to be such a bioassessment tool. We assigned independent samples to IBI development (n = 75) and IBI validation (n = 25) data sets. We placed Hester-Dendy artificial substrates at the sites for 6 wk and processed the samples of colonizing macroinvertebrates in the laboratory with a 500-target subsampling procedure plus a large-rare taxon search. Independent of the biota, we assigned an environmental disturbance score to each site based upon water chemistry, land cover, flow modification, and point-source pollution. Ten metrics that represent macroinvertebrate assemblage structure, composition, and function constitute the IBI: the number of taxa in: 1) Insecta or 2) Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT); % individuals that were: 3) Insecta, 4) intolerant EPT, 5) tolerant chironomids, 6) gatherers, 7) scrapers, or from 8) the dominant 3 taxa; 9) the mean pollution tolerance value; and 10) the number of unique ecological functional trait niches. Analyses on both the validation subset of sites and all sites inclusive confirmed that least-disturbed sites had the highest IBI scores, severely disturbed sites had the lowest scores, and moderately disturbed sites had intermediate scores. Chironominae and Hydropsychidae taxa known to tolerate nutrient enrichment and overall degraded conditions dominated samples with low IBI scores. In contrast, a diverse assemblage that thrives in relatively undisturbed conditions was present in samples with high IBI scores. Comparison of the new macroinvertebrate IBI with an existing fish IBI suggested that the indices respond to different environmental stressors and illustrated the limitations of using only one taxonomic group for bioassessment. We discuss new macroinvertebrate methods, an IBI development process, and the refinement of metrics that may be useful in tailoring assessment tools for large rivers or wadeable streams in other regions. We also present applications of the IBI, including its potential use in comprehensive large river monitoring programs and for evaluating management efforts.

AB Benthic invertebrates have important ecosystem engineering functions (bioturbation and biodeposition) in freshwater and marine benthic systems. Bioturbation and biodeposition affect the metabolism of the water-sediment interface through modification of water-sediment fluxes or organic-matter enrichment of sediments by biodeposits. The functional significance of these processes depends strongly on the type of invertebrate activities (the functional traits of the invertebrates) and on the modulation of this activity by environmental conditions. The aim of my article is to propose a common framework for the role of bioturbation/biodeposition in benthic habitats of both marine and freshwater environments. In these ecosystems, hydrological exchanges between the water and sediments (interstitial flow rates) control the microbial activity inside sediments. The ability of ecosystem engineers to influence benthic microbial processes differs strongly between diffusion-dominated (low interstitial flow rates) and advection-dominated (high interstitial flow rates) habitats. Bioturbation/biodeposition may play a role in diffusion-dominated habitats where invertebrates can significantly modify water and particle fluxes at the water-sediment interface, whereas a slight influence of ecosystem engineers is expected in advection-dominated habitats where fluxes are predominantly controlled by hydrological processes. A future challenge will be to test this general framework in marine and freshwater habitats by quantifying the interactions between the functional traits of species and the water-sediment exchanges.

AB A range of biodiversity metrics are available to assess the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. However, performance varies considerably among different types of metrics and provides different information regarding ecosystem conditions, thus making difficult the selection of appropriate metrics for biomonitoring. The present study evaluated the robustness of six biodiversity metrics to assess environmental change and determine their utility as relevant indicators of ecosystem biodiversity and functionality. Traditional metrics such as species richness and Shannon diversity were considered along with alternative metrics such as functional diversity, size diversity and taxonomic distinctness. To that end, invertebrate assemblages in a river floodplain were used as a case study to evaluate the performance of metrics using Generalized Additive Models (GAM). GAM explained between eight and 49% of the variability in biodiversity. The regression models exhibited differences in the response of biodiversity indicators to environmental factors, suggesting that intermediate levels of turbidity and low salinity are conditions favouring increased biodiversity in the study area. Based on correlations among metrics and responses to primary environmental factors, it is concluded that Shannon and functional diversity, and rarefied species richness generated similar information regarding ecosystem conditions (i.e., the metrics were redundant): while size diversity and distinctness provided useful additional data characterizing ecosystem quality (i.e., the metrics were complementary). Functional diversity indicated riot only number and dominance of species, but also each species functional role in the community, and was therefore the most informative biodiversity metric. Nevertheless, the use of a combination of metrics, for example functional and size diversity, and variation in taxonomic distinctness, provides complementary data that will serve to achieve a more thorough understanding of ecosystem structure and function, and response to primary environmental influences.

AB The mechanisms that drive species coexistence and community dynamics have long puzzled ecologists. Here, we explain species coexistence, size structure and diversity patterns in a phytoplankton community using a combination of four fundamental factors: organism traits, size-based constraints, hydrology and species competition. Using a 'microscopic' Lotka-Volterra competition (MLVC) model (i.e. with explicit recipes to compute its parameters), we provide a mechanistic explanation of species coexistence along a niche axis (i.e. organismic volume). We based our model on empirically measured quantities, minimal ecological assumptions and stochastic processes. In nature, we found aggregated patterns of species biovolume (i.e. clumps) along the volume axis and a peak in species richness. Both patterns were reproduced by the MLVC model. Observed clumps corresponded to niche zones (volumes) where species fitness was highest, or where fitness was equal among competing species. The latter implies the action of equalizing processes, which would suggest emergent neutrality as a plausible mechanism to explain community patterns.

AB Clonality resulting from the growth of specialized organs is common among plants in wetland habitats. We hypothesize that different wetland habitats select for different attributes of clonal traits. This hypothesis is based on studies of individual species but has not been previously tested at the level of habitat. We compared the functional diversity of clonal growth traits of plants in bogs, fens, wet heathlands, floodplains, river beds, open fresh water habitats, salt marshes, and open marine habitats. Clonal traits (including number of offspring, lateral spread, persistence of connections between ramets, and shoot life span) were analysed with multivariate techniques using species frequency data and with permutation tests using presence/absence data. Based on species frequencies, clonal plants in aquatic habitats (open fresh water habitats, open marine habitats, and river beds) were characterized by the abundant production of freely dispersible propagules, annual shoots, and splitting clones. Species of daily flooded salt marshes were characterized by bi-annual connections between ramets and medium dispersability. In contrast, plants in permanently wet bogs were characterized by polycyclic shoots and low offspring production. The specificity of river beds and open freshwater habitats was also confirmed by permutation tests, which gave equal weight to rare and abundant species. However, species in all other wetland habitats were characterized by the entire range of clonal traits, suggesting weak environmental filtering of analyzed traits by habitat at the present scale.

AB The benthic community was analyzed to evaluate pollution-induced changes for the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated site at Hunters Point (HP) relative to 30 reference sites in San Francisco Bay, California, USA. An analysis based on functional traits of feeding, reproduction, and position in the sediment shows that HP is depauperate in deposit feeders, subsurface carnivores, and species with no protective barrier. Sediment chemistry analysis shows that PCBs are the major risk drivers at HP (1,570 ppb) and that the reference sites contain very low levels of PCB contamination (9 ppb). Different feeding traits support the existence of direct pathways of exposure, which can be mechanistically linked to PCB bioaccumulation by biodynamic modeling. The model shows that the deposit feeder Neanthes arenaceodentata accumulates approximately 20 times more PCBs in its lipids than the facultative deposit feeder Macoma balthica and up to 130 times more than the filter feeder Mytilus edulis. The comparison of different exposure scenarios suggests that PCB tissue concentrations at HP are two orders of magnitude higher than at the reference sites. At full scale, in situ sorbent amendment with activated carbon may reduce PCB bioaccumulation at HP by up to 85 to 90% under favorable field and treatment conditions. The modeling framework further demonstrates that such expected remedial success corresponds to exposure conditions suggested as the cleanup goal for HP. However, concentrations remain slightly higher than at the reference sites. The present study demonstrates how the remedial success of a sorbent amendment, which lowers the PCB availability, can be compared to reference conditions and traditional cleanup goals, which are commonly based on bulk sediment concentrations.

AB Studies investigating the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem processes have often reached different conclusions, probably because insufficient attention has been paid to some aspects including (1) which biodiversity measure (e.g., species number, species identity or trait) better explains ecosystem functioning, (2) the mechanisms underpinning biodiversity effects, and (3) how can environmental context modulates biodiversity effects. Here, we investigated how species number (one to three species) and traits of aquatic fungal decomposers (by replacement of a functional type from an unpolluted site by another from a metal-polluted site) affect fungal production (biomass acumulation) and plant litter decomposition in the presence and absence of metal stress. To examine the putative mechanisms that explain biodiversity effects, we determined the contribution of each fungal species to the total biomass produced in multicultures by real-time PCR. In the absence of metal, positive diversity effects were observed for fungal production and leaf decomposition as a result of species complementarity. Metal stress decreased diversity effects on leaf decomposition in assemblages containing the functional type from the unpolluted site, probably due to competitive interactions between fungi. However, dominance effect maintained positive diversity effects under metal stress in assemblages containing the functional type from the metal-polluted site. These findings emphasize the importance of intraspecific diversity in modulating diversity effects under metal stress, providing evidence that trait-based diversity measures should be incorporated when examining biodiversity effects.

AB Sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is one of the major marine species cultivated in Southern Europe. An ongoing selection programme based on production traits has produced the first generation of different strains issued from wild, domesticated or selected sires. Inter-strain differences exist upon many fish species. To test if that was the case in these strains of sea bass, we measured individual oxygen consumption (MO2) in relation to swimming speed, critical swimming speed, standard metabolic rate, active metabolic rate, aerobic metabolic scope, net cost of transport and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption. MO2 associated to swimming effort tended to be lower in the Wild strain, when compared to Domesticated and Selected strains. Nevertheless, no significant (p > 0.05) inter-strain differences were observed for none of the physiological traits listed above. These results suggest that (i) the selection process, based on production traits, respects functional integrity in the three strains of sea bass, and that (ii) this species possesses a large physiological plasticity. Nevertheless, before validating this selection framework, studies should be done in order to compare other genetic, physiological and behavioural traits in other strains issued from more than one generation of selection.

AB Innovations in locomotor morphology have been invoked as important drivers of vertebrate diversification, although the influence of novel locomotion strategies on marine fish diversification remains largely unexplored. Using triggerfish as a case study, we determine whether the evolution of the distinctive synchronization of enlarged dorsal and anal fins that triggerfish use to swim may have catalyzed the ecological diversification of the group. By adopting a comparative phylogenetic approach to quantify median fin and body shape integration and to assess the tempo of functional and morphological evolution in locomotor traits, we find that: (1) functional and morphological components of the locomotive system exhibit a strong signal of correlated evolution; (2) triggerfish partitioned locomotor morphological and functional spaces early in their history; and (3) there is no strong evidence that a pulse of lineage diversification accompanied the major episode of phenotypic diversification. Together these findings suggest that the acquisition of a distinctive mode of locomotion drove an early radiation of shape and function in triggerfish, but not an early radiation of species.

AB Species present in communities are affected by the prevailing environmental conditions, and the traits that these species display may be sensitive indicators of community responses to environmental change. However, interpretation of community responses may be confounded by environmental variation at different spatial scales. Using a hierarchical approach, we assessed the spatial and temporal variation of traits in coastal fish communities in Lake Huron over a 5-year time period (2001-2005) in response to biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The association of environmental and spatial variables with trophic, life-history, and thermal traits at two spatial scales (regional basin-scale, local site-scale) was quantified using multivariate statistics and variation partitioning. We defined these two scales (regional, local) on which to measure variation and then applied this measurement framework identically in all 5 study years. With this framework, we found that there was no change in the spatial scales of fish community traits over the course of the study, although there were small inter-annual shifts in the importance of regional basin- and local site-scale variables in determining community trait composition (e.g., life-history, trophic, and thermal). The overriding effects of regional-scale variables may be related to inter-annual variation in average summer temperature. Additionally, drivers of fish community traits were highly variable among study years, with some years dominated by environmental variation and others dominated by spatially structured variation. The influence of spatial factors on trait composition was dynamic, which suggests that spatial patterns in fish communities over large landscapes are transient. Air temperature and vegetation were significant variables in most years, underscoring the importance of future climate change and shoreline development as drivers of fish community structure. Overall, a trait-based hierarchical framework may be a useful conservation tool, as it highlights the multi-scaled interactive effect of variables over a large landscape.

AB With global climate changes, biological invasions are considered to be one of the main causes of the decline of freshwater biodiversity. In this context, predicted increases in global temperature may alter the geographical distributions of native and invasive species. The purpose of our study was to examine the metabolic, behavioral and physiological responses to short-term temperature acclimation of two widely distributed species (the most successful European invader, Dikerogammarus villosus, and its main victim, Gammarus pulex), in order to estimate the potential effect of global warming on its invasion of freshwater ecosystems. Our results show that D. villosus is more vulnerable to high temperatures than G. pulex. The native species seems to be best adapted to intermediate temperatures (10-20 degrees C) with a possibility of adjustment to "extreme" temperatures (5-27 degrees C), whereas the "killer shrimp" D. villosus seems best adapted to lower temperatures (5-10 degrees C) with a limited possibility of adjustment above 20 degrees C In the light of our results, global warming is likely to be less favorable to the invasive species. However, D. villosus showed reduced metabolic and activity rates, associated with higher glycogen content. This adaptive strategy was interpreted as having functional advantages, allowing D. villosus to successfully invade harsh and/or unpredictable biotopes. In addition, our results show that glycogen stores may be used as a powerful indicator of the optimal thermal window for aquatic ectotherms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The relation of macrobenthic species turnover (beta diversity) and species plylogenetic variation with functional diversity patterns, across an environmental gradient induced by an aquaculture unit, in a coastal area of the island of Lesvos (NE Aegean) has been investigated in this study. The contribution of rare species response and species dispersal ability in the variation of functional diversity patterns along the environmental gradient, on a spatio-temporal scale, has been also examined. Our results revealed that benthic functional diversity was decreasing monotonically with increasing species turnover rate and hence with increasing spatial variability along the environmental gradient. Increased environmental stress which was detected in the immediate vicinity of the fish cages resulted to low species functional redundancy, since different species didn't perform the same functional role at the most disturbed part of the established gradient. Functional diversity patterns were found to be correlated with species population size, whereas a strong linear relationship was also detected with phylogenetic diversity patterns, thus supporting the claim that wider local taxonomic trees can support a wider range of species functions even in small spatial scales. Rare species loss seemed to be one of the dominant factors ruling functional diversity variation. Species with the minimum possible dispersal ability, which were mostly rare, tend to diminish both in species number and population size faster than species with wider dispersal ability towards the most disturbed areas. The aforementioned results indicate that rare species variation and endemic species loss are critical factors in determining functional diversity loss across a human-induced environmental gradient in soft bottom benthic communities.

AB For organisms living in the intertidal zone, temperature is an important selective agent that can shape species distributions and drive phenotypic variation among populations. Littorinid snails, which occupy the upper limits of rocky shores and estuaries worldwide, often experience extreme high temperatures and prolonged aerial emersion during low tides, yet their robust physiology coupled with morphological and behavioral traits permits these gastropods to persist and exert strong grazing control over algal communities. We use a mechanistic heat-budget model to compare the effects of behavioral and morphological traits on the body temperatures of five species of littorinid snails under natural weather conditions. Model predictions and field experiments indicate that, for all five species, the relative contribution of shell color or sculpturing to temperature regulation is small, on the order of 0.2-2 degrees C, while behavioral choices such as removing the foot from the substratum or reorienting the shell can lower body temperatures by 2-4 degrees C on average. Temperatures in central California rarely exceeded the thermal tolerance limits of the local littorinid species during the study period, but at sites where snails are regularly exposed to extreme high temperatures, the functional significance of the tested traits may be important. The mechanistic approach used here provides the ability to gauge the importance of behavioral and morphological traits for controlling body temperature as species approach their physiological thresholds.

AB Productivity in desert ecosystems is primarily limited by water followed by nitrogen availability. In the deserts of southern California, nitrogen additions have increased invasive annual plant abundance. Similar findings from other ecosystems have led to a general acceptance that invasive plants, especially annual grasses, are nitrophilous. Consequently, reductions of soil nitrogen via carbon amendments have been conducted by many researchers in a variety of ecosystems in order to disproportionately lower invasive species abundance, but with mixed success. Recent studies suggest that resource-use traits may predict the efficacy of such resource manipulations; however, this theory remains largely untested. We report findings from a carbon amendment experiment that utilized two levels of sucrose additions that were aimed at achieving soil carbon to nitrogen ratios of 50:1 and 100:1 in labile sources. Carbon amendments were applied once each year, for three years, corresponding with the first large precipitation event of each wet season. Plant functional traits measured on the three invasive and 11 native herbaceous species that were most common at the study site showed that exotic and native species did not differ in traits associated with nitrogen use. In fact, plant abundance measures such as density, cover, and biomass showed that carbon amendments were capable of decreasing both native and invasive species. We found that early-germinating species were the most impacted by decreased soil nitrogen resulting from amendments. Because invasive annuals typically germinate earlier and exhibit a rapid phenology compared to most natives, these species are expected to be more competitive than native annuals yet more susceptible to early-season carbon amendments. However, desert annual communities can exhibit high interannual variability in species composition and abundance. Therefore, the relative abundance of native and invasive species at the time of application is critical to the success of carbon amendments at our study site. For land management purposes, carbon amendments remain relatively impractical and may only be useful at small scales or in conjunction with other invasive species removal techniques.

   Utricularia australis is a submerged rootless aquatic carnivorous plant with homogeneous shoots, exhibiting a great morphological and ecological plasticity and propagating only vegetatively by shoot branching. Detailed branching and morphometric characteristics of two U. australis populations were compared at two sites in the Trebon basin, Czech Republic. The sites, mesotrophic fishpond Ruda and oligotrophic sand-pit Cep, differed greatly in their trophic status and prey availability, and thus in plant size, fitness, and flowering. Flowering plants at Ruda were robust, highly branched, and produced on average totally 52 branches of various orders forming about 52.9 % dry weight of the total vegetative plant dry weight. All plants collected were on average relatively short, 12.5 % flowered, and 90 % contained a branch >3 cm long with functional traps. In comparison, plants at Cep were much shorter, their internodes were strongly shortened, only 5 % of plants flowered, and only 60 % of plants bore distinguishable branches (on average only 1.1 branches a plant and 1.4 % of total plant dry weight). Shoot branching was recognized as one of the most important reasons for high plasticity of U. australis and for attaining high relative growth rate. Branching intensity of main shoots in U. australis might reflect discrete ecological conditions of each micropopulation. To understand the dynamic growth traits of aquatic carnivorous plants, a combination of branching characteristics and mathematical modelling is essential.

AB The coastal grasslands in north-eastern South Africa are a severely threatened vegetation type rich in plant species, particularly forbs. Many of the forbs have underground storage organs which allow them to resprout rapidly after fires. A significant portion of this land was placed under commercial pine afforestation in the 1950s. The pine plantations have since been removed starting 17 years ago and restored to grasslands within a conservation area. We assessed the effects of plantations on grassland plant diversity and functional trait composition by sampling 64 circular quadrats of 5 m radius distributed equally in restored versus natural grasslands. The difference in plant diversity was dramatic with the natural grassland supporting 221 species of which 163 were forbs compared with 144 and only 73 forb species in restored grasslands. Major differences in species composition were recorded, especially for forb species. Natural grasslands were dominated by resprouters (130 species) but these were rare in the restored grasslands (36 species). Differences in plant species response to fire were also evident for the two grassland states. In contrast to coastal forest restoration studies in the same area which have shown near linear increases in woody species with time, restored grasslands showed no increase in forb species richness with increasing time since clear-felling of pines. Our results indicate that current methods for restoring these grasslands are inadequate and that restoring grasslands may be a lot harder than previously thought. Considerable effort should be made in conserving what is left of natural grasslands.

AB Benthic macrofauna can influence inputs and transformations of energy and matter in estuaries, affecting both the stocks of vital materials (e.g. carbon, oxygen) and the rates of key processes (e.g. organic matter decomposition, nutrient uptake). Although a number of studies have identified shifts in functional groups or biological traits in relation to anthropogenic stressors, there have been few field-based assessments of changes in functioning associated with stress gradients. We used a comparative experimental approach to investigate functioning on two sandflats with differing exposures to urban contaminants. Apart from significant differences in sediment contaminant concentrations (43.2 +/- 1.8 mg kg-1 Zn and 15.6 +/- 0.9 mg kg-1 Pb at the Pollen site; 17.7 +/- 0.7 mg kg-1 Zn and 7.9 +/- 0.9 mg kg-1 Pb at the Waiheke site), the two sandflats were readily comparable: both had similar sediment grain size distributions and were dominated by the same macrofaunal species; and both were in non-eutrophic New Zealand marine reserves with low ambient sediment organic matter content. To better understand the effects of contaminants on biologically mediated transformations of organic matter into inorganic nutrients, we manipulated sediment organic matter content and macrofaunal abundance in standardized treatments at each site. Fluxes of oxygen and ammonium, which are linked to key sandflat processes such as organic matter decomposition and benthic photosynthesis, were measured as response variables 1 week after the experimental manipulations. We predicted more efficient organic matter processing on the uncontaminated flat and thus expected to see elevated ammonium efflux in response to organic enrichment treatments at this site. Higher rates of benthic photosynthesis were predicted for plots with higher ammonium efflux, as ammonium is a readily utilizable form of limiting inorganic nitrogen. We documented significant positive relationships between ammonium uptake and benthic primary production on the uncontaminated flat, but weaker/insignificant relationships at the contaminated site. Our data were consistent with theories of increased variability and a decoupling of system processes with increasing amounts of stress.

AB The Ecological Evaluation Index continuous formula (EEI-c) was designed to estimate the habitat-based ecological status of rocky coastal and sedimentary transitional waters using shallow benthic macrophyte communities as bioindicators. This study aimed to remedy the weaknesses of the currently used EEI methodology in: (1) ecological status groups (ESG), (2) the formula, and (3) reference condition values.
   A cluster analysis of twelve species traits was used to delineate ESGs. Two main clusters (ESG I, late-successional; ESG II, opportunistic) were identified that were hierarchically divided into three and two sub-clusters, respectively: ESG I comprised thick perennial (IA), thick plastic (IB) and shade-adapted plastic (IC) coastal water species, and angiosperm plastic (IA), thick plastic (IB) and shade-adapted plastic (IC) transitional water species. ESG II comprised fleshy opportunistic (IIB) and filamentous sheet-like opportunistic (I IA) species both in coastal and transitional waters.
   To avoid discrete jumps at the boundaries between predefined ecological categories, a hyperbolic model that approximates the index values and expresses the ecosystem status in continuous numbers was developed. Seventy-four quantitative and destructive samples of the upper infralittoral Cystoseira crinita and coastal lagoon Ruppia cirrhosa communities from tentative pristine to less impacted sites in Greece verified 10 as an 'ideal' EEI-c reference condition value.

AB P>Despite growing attention on the influence of functional diversity changes on ecosystem functioning, a palaeoecological perspective on the long-term dynamic of functional diversity, including mass extinction crises, is still lacking. Here, using a novel multidimensional functional framework and comprehensive null-models, we compare the functional structure of Cambrian, Silurian and modern benthic marine biotas. We demonstrate that, after controlling for increases in taxonomic diversity, functional richness increased incrementally between each time interval with benthic taxa filling progressively more functional space, combined with a significant functional dissimilarity between periods. The modern benthic biota functionally overlaps with fossil biotas but some modern taxa, especially large predators, have new trait combinations that may allow more functions to be performed. From a methodological perspective, these results illustrate the benefits of using multidimensional instead of lower dimensional functional frameworks when studying changes in functional diversity over space and time.

AB Low-flow disturbances are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity because of climate change and extensive human water withdrawal, but the effect of decreased flow on aquatic insect communities is not well understood. I explored the resistance of aquatic insects to reduced flow by creating an experimental low-flow disturbance that diverted similar to 40 to 80% of the water in 3 replicate streams for 2 summers. I sampled the aquatic insect community in control and treatment reaches before and during the 3-mo water diversions. I used a trait-based approach to analyze the data because traits have the potential to increase mechanistic understanding and predictive capabilities. The analysis focused on 6 traits: desiccation resistance, maximum crawling rate, armoring, size at maturity, rheophily, and habit. Community trait composition underwent strong seasonal shifts, but few consistent responses to reduced flow were observed. The 2 trait states that did appear to confer increased resistance were high crawling rate and armoring. These trait states can provide protection from predators. Thus, biotic interactions might be important during low-flow disturbance.

AB The concept of functional trait-environment relationship posits that species in a local community should possess similar traits that match the selective environment. The present study examines species trait-habitat (using Fourth-corner and RLQ analyses) and habitat occupancy patterns (logistic regression models) of bird assemblages in boreal forest stands following disturbances by forest fire and salvage logging. The stands differed in the amount and composition of residual tree retention, salvage- and aquatic-edges, degree of burn severity (all measured at 100 and 500 m buffers), as well as landscape-level variables such as distance to previously burned forests. Tests of trait-habitat relationships showed that canopy-nesters and bark- and foliage- insectivores required high levels of residual trees of low burn severity, with the feeding guilds showing affinity for different stand composition. In contrast, ground-nesters and omnivores thrived in salvaged areas and associated edges. In addition, cavity-nesting and ground-foragers were associated with severely burned stands. The species' habitat occupancy patterns were commensurate with trait requirements, which also appeared to be scale-dependent. For example, some fire-associated species had high occupancy probability in severely burned stands at small-scale (100 m buffer), which was consistent with their cavity-nesting trait. This pattern, however, was not evident at large-scale, where their feeding requirement (bark-insectivores) for low-severity burns dominated. Our study suggests that trait-habitat relationships can provide critical information to the complex ways species' relate to key habitat factors following natural and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB P>Alcanivorax dieselolei strain B-5 is a marine bacterium that can utilize a broad range of n-alkanes (C(5)-C(36)) as sole carbon source. However, the mechanisms responsible for this trait remain to be established. Here we report on the characterization of four alkane hydroxylases from A. dieselolei, including two homologues of AlkB (AlkB1 and AlkB2), a CYP153 homologue (P450), as well as an AlmA-like (AlmA) alkane hydroxylase. Heterologous expression of alkB1, alkB2, p450 and almA in Pseudomonas putida GPo12 (pGEc47 Delta B) or P. fluorescens KOB2 Delta 1 verified their functions in alkane oxidation. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that these genes could be induced by alkanes ranging from C(8) to C(36). Notably, the expression of the p450 and almA genes was only upregulated in the presence of medium-chain (C(8)-C(16)) or long-chain (C(22)-C(36)) n-alkanes, respectively; while alkB1 and alkB2 responded to both medium- and long-chain n-alkanes (C(12)-C(26)). Moreover, branched alkanes (pristane and phytane) significantly elevated alkB1 and almA expression levels. Our findings demonstrate that the multiple alkane hydroxylase systems ensure the utilization of substrates of a broad chain length range.

AB The EC Water Frame Directive (WFD) states that all coastal water bodies must achieve 'good ecological status' by the year 2015. A range of different classification methods have been developed and used to define ecological status to support the WFD. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of using two different mesh sizes of sieve (1.0 and 0.5 mm) on zoobenthic assemblages and on the ecological status of benthic macrofauna (using the Brackish water benthic index, BBI) in three ecologically distinct archipelago areas (Inner, Middle and Outer) in the Aland Islands, Northern Baltic Sea. We performed a biological trait analysis (BTA) to evaluate differences in the functional (trait) diversity of macrofauna collected using different mesh sizes and estimate the ecological relevance of mesh size. The results showed that sieve mesh size had significant effects on the recorded number of species, abundance, and total biomass of the zoobenthos. Small-bodied species and juveniles (e. g. Macoma balthica) were not observed when using a 1.0-mm mesh. The ecological status (sensu WFD) was only slightly affected by the mesh size, and all areas had good or high ecological status. BTA showed a difference in trait composition when using 0.5- or 1.0-mm mesh, particularly in the Outer area, where the proportion of small-sized species was high. Our results highlight how biological traits, in addition to species number and biomass, can play a key role when analyzing ecosystem structure for assessment and classification of coastal ecosystems. We show that combining traditional monitoring for the EU WFD with a functional analysis strengthens our ability to interpret environmental quality, and thus increases the precision of our advice for management purposes.

AB In two related field studies: (1) a multiscale riparian forest inventory and (2) a comparative study of natural forest gap and nongap environments, we explored regeneration patterns of native riparian trees in relation to large- and small-scale ecological drivers in four western Oregon watersheds spanning a climatic gradient from dry to wet. Twenty-three tree species were classified by life history traits into five functional groups that differed in shade and drought tolerance; distribution and abundance of tree regeneration were analyzed by group. For most groups, seedling abundance varied substantially across the large scale climate gradient. In particular, drought tolerant species decreased sharply in abundance from the drier to wetter watersheds. Overall seedling frequency and diversity also decreased from the driest to wettest watersheds, while nurse log use increased. Regeneration of most, but not all, species was greater in gaps.
   Principal conclusions are that life history information was useful for categorizing species and quite predictive of regeneration behavior overall, yet for many species contextual factors such as climate, forest structure, and adjoining species were also very important. Species appeared to regenerate opportunistically wherever local conditions fell within their environmental tolerances and competitive abilities. Management or restoration of riparian forests, therefore, requires knowledge of site conditions, the life history of the riparian trees present, and in particular an understanding of the species' environmental tolerances, disturbance responses, and competitive abilities relative to one another.

AB Recently, the importance of body mass and allometric scaling for the structure and dynamics of ecological networks has been highlighted in several ground-breaking studies. However, advances in the understanding of generalities across ecosystem types are impeded to a considerable extent by a methodological dichotomy contrasting a considerable portion of marine ecology on the one hand opposite to traditional community ecology on the other hand. Many marine ecologists are bound to the taxonomy-neglecting size spectrum approach when describing and analysing community patterns. In contrast, the mindset of the other school is focused on taxonomies according to the Linnean system at the cost of obscuring information due to applying species or population averages of body masses and other traits. Following other pioneering studies, we addressed this lingering gap, and studied non-linear interaction strengths (i.e. functional responses) between two taxonomically-distinct terrestrial arthropod predators (centipedes and spiders) of varying individual body masses and their prey. We fitted three non-linear functional response models to the data: (1) a taxonomic model not accounting for variance in body masses amongst predator individuals, (2) an allometric model ignoring taxonomic differences between predator individuals, and (3) a combined model including body mass and taxonomic effects. Ranked according to their AICs, the combined model performs better than the allometric model, which provides a superior fit to the data than the taxonomic model. These results strongly indicate that the body masses of predator and prey individuals were responsible for most of the variation in non-linear interaction strengths. Taxonomy explained some specific patterns in allometric exponents between groups and revealed mechanistic insights in predation efficiencies. Reconciling quantitative allometric models as employed by the marine size-spectrum approach with taxonomic information may thus yield quantitative results that are generalized across ecosystem types and taxonomic groups. Using these quantitative models as novel null models should also strengthen subsequent taxonomic analyses.

AB The legume genus Lotus includes glycophytic forage crops and other species adapted to extreme environments, such as saline soils. Understanding salt tolerance mechanisms will contribute to the discovery of new traits which may enhance the breeding efforts towards improved performance of legumes in marginal agricultural environments. Here, we used a combination of ionomic and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolite profilings of complete shoots (pooling leaves, petioles and stems) to compare the extremophile Lotus creticus, adapted to highly saline coastal regions, and two cultivated glycophytic grassland forage species, Lotus corniculatus and Lotus tenuis. L. creticus exhibited better survival after exposure to long-term lethal salinity and was more efficient at excluding Cl- from the shoots than the glycophytes. In contrast, Na+ levels were higher in the extremophile under both control and salt stress, a trait often observed in halophytes. Ionomics demonstrated a differential rearrangement of shoot nutrient levels in the extremophile upon salt exposure. Metabolite profiling showed that responses to NaCl in L. creticus shoots were globally similar to those of the glycophytes, providing little evidence for metabolic pre-adaptation to salinity. This study is the first comparing salt acclimation responses between extremophile and non-extremophile legumes, and challenges the generalization of the metabolic salt pre-adaptation hypothesis.

AB Background: The genomic architecture of bud phenology and height growth remains poorly known in most forest trees. In non model species, QTL studies have shown limited application because most often QTL data could not be validated from one experiment to another. The aim of our study was to overcome this limitation by basing QTL detection on the construction of genetic maps highly-enriched in gene markers, and by assessing QTLs across pedigrees, years, and environments.
   Results: Four saturated individual linkage maps representing two unrelated mapping populations of 260 and 500 clonally replicated progeny were assembled from 471 to 570 markers, including from 283 to 451 gene SNPs obtained using a multiplexed genotyping assay. Thence, a composite linkage map was assembled with 836 gene markers. For individual linkage maps, a total of 33 distinct quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were observed for bud flush, 52 for bud set, and 52 for height growth. For the composite map, the corresponding numbers of QTL clusters were 11, 13, and 10. About 20% of QTLs were replicated between the two mapping populations and nearly 50% revealed spatial and/or temporal stability. Three to four occurrences of overlapping QTLs between characters were noted, indicating regions with potential pleiotropic effects. Moreover, some of the genes involved in the QTLs were also underlined by recent genome scans or expression profile studies.
   Overall, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by each QTL ranged from 3.0 to 16.4% for bud flush, from 2.7 to 22.2% for bud set, and from 2.5 to 10.5% for height growth. Up to 70% of the total character variance could be accounted for by QTLs for bud flush or bud set, and up to 59% for height growth.
   Conclusions: This study provides a basic understanding of the genomic architecture related to bud flush, bud set, and height growth in a conifer species, and a useful indicator to compare with Angiosperms. It will serve as a basic reference to functional and association genetic studies of adaptation and growth in Picea taxa. The putative QTNs identified will be tested for associations in natural populations, with potential applications in molecular breeding and gene conservation programs. QTLs mapping consistently across years and environments could also be the most important targets for breeding, because they represent genomic regions that may be least affected by G x E interactions.

AB We synthesise traditional unstructured food webs, allometric body size scaling, trait-based modelling, and physiologically structured modelling to provide a novel and ecologically relevant tool for size-structured food webs. The framework allows food web models to include ontogenetic growth and life-history omnivory at the individual level by resolving the population structure of each species as a size-spectrum. Each species is characterised by the trait 'size at maturation', and all model parameters are made species independent through scaling with individual body size and size at maturation. Parameter values are determined from cross-species analysis of fish communities as life-history omnivory is widespread in aquatic systems, but may be reparameterised for other systems. An ensemble of food webs is generated and the resulting communities are analysed at four levels of organisation: community level, species level, trait level, and individual level. The model may be solved analytically by assuming that the community spectrum follows a power law. The analytical solution provides a baseline expectation of the results of complex food web simulations, and agrees well with the predictions of the full model on biomass distribution as a function of individual size, biomass distribution as a function of size at maturation, and relation between predator-prey mass ratio of preferred and eaten food. The full model additionally predicts the diversity distribution as a function of size at maturation. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We compiled light utilization traits for 56 species of freshwater phytoplankton to analyze group differences, trait trade-offs, and allometric scaling relationships. We also used these traits to explain differences in major group distributions along the light availability gradient in 527 lakes in the continental United States. Major taxonomic groups differed significantly in their light utilization traits. Cyanobacteria had the highest initial slope of the growth-irradiance curve (alpha) and low irradiance at the onset of photoinhibition, indicating adaptation to low light environments. Green algae had the highest maximal growth rates and low alpha, indicating adaptation to higher light environments. Groups capable of mixotrophy had traits indicative of poor light competitive abilities and high light requirements. Key light utilization traits scaled allometrically with cell size and exhibited trade-offs leading to contrasting ecological strategies; alpha and cell size were conserved at the highest taxonomic level (domain), indicating a fundamental trait divergence between prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton. In line with these trait differences, major groups showed different responses to light availability in natural conditions. The relative abundances of low light-adapted groups declined with increasing light availability and vice versa. The genera mean values of the initial slopes of the growth-irradiance curves were significantly negatively correlated with the slopes of the relationships between the genus's relative abundance and light availability characterized by Secchi depth in 527 lakes. This indicates that light utilization traits can be used to explain phytoplankton distributions in nature.

AB Using metagenomic 'parts lists' to infer global patterns on microbial ecology remains a significant challenge. To deduce important ecological indicators such as environmental adaptation, molecular trait dispersal, diversity variation and primary production from the gene pool of an ecosystem, we integrated 25 ocean metagenomes with geographical, meteorological and geophysicochemical data. We find that climatic factors (temperature, sunlight) are the major determinants of the biomolecular repertoire of each sample and the main limiting factor on functional trait dispersal (absence of biogeographic provincialism). Molecular functional richness and diversity show a distinct latitudinal gradient peaking at 20 degrees N and correlate with primary production. The latter can also be predicted from the molecular functional composition of an environmental sample. Together, our results show that the functional community composition derived from metagenomes is an important quantitative readout for molecular trait-based biogeography and ecology.

AB Due to their nutrient recycling function and their importance in food-webs, macroinvertebrates are essential for the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. These organisms also constitute an important component of biodiversity.
   Sediment evaluation and monitoring is an essential aspect of ecosystem monitoring since sediments represent an important component of aquatic habitats and are also a potential source of contamination. In this study, we focused on macroinvertebrate communities within run-of-river dams, that are prime areas for sediment and pollutant accumulation. Little is known about littoral macroinvertebrate communities within run-of-river dam or their response to sediment levels and pollution. We therefore aimed to evaluate the following aspects: the functional and structural composition of macroinvertebrate communities in run-of-river dams; the impact of pollutant accumulation on such communities, and the most efficient scales and tools needed for the biomonitoring of contaminated sediments in such environments. Two run-of-river dams located in the French alpine area were selected and three spatial scales were examined: transversal (banks and channel), transversal x longitudinal (banks/channel x tail/middle/dam) and patch scale (erosion, sedimentation and vegetation habitats). At the patch scale, we noted that the heterogeneity of littoral habitats provided many available niches that allow for the development of diversified macroinvertebrate communities. This implies highly variable responses to contamination. Once combined on a global 'banks' spatial scale, littoral habitats can highlight the effects of toxic disturbances. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Sponges harbor a remarkable diversity of bacteria, however, little is known about the functional properties of such bacterial symbionts. In this study, we present the genomic and functional characterization of an uncultured delta-proteobacterium associated with the sponge Cymbastela concentrica. We show that this organism represents a novel phylogenetic clade and propose that it lives in association with a cyanobacterium. We also provide an overview of the predicted functional and ecological properties of this delta-proteobacterium, and discuss its complex interactions with surrounding cells and milieu, including traits of cell attachment, nutrient transport and protein-protein interactions.

AB Restoration ecology can benefit greatly from developments in trait-based ecology that enable improved predictions of how the composition of plant communities will respond to changes in environmental conditions. Plant functional traits can be used to guide the restoration of degraded habitats by closely tailoring treatments to the local species pool. We tested this approach in two heavily invaded coastal California grasslands. We asked whether native plant abundance and plant community trait composition respond to (1) experimental soil fertility reduction in the form of twice-yearly carbon (C) amendments and (2) disturbance in the form of mowing. We measured height, specific leaf area, leaf thickness and leaf density from individuals of 39 species in the control and C addition plots, and supplemented these trait values with database information on growth form, lifespan, nitrogen-fixing ability and seed mass.
   Consistent with theoretical predictions, C addition favored short, large-seeded and nitrogen-fixing species, while mowing benefitted short species with high specific leaf area. However, native and exotic species did not differ in any of the measured traits, and neither group benefitted generally from the treatments. Carbon addition led to large intraspecific trait shifts, with individuals in C addition plots having smaller, denser leaves and shorter stature. Species' trait plasticity, however, was not related to the community composition response to C addition.
   Our study indicates that trait-based ecology is sufficiently mature to provide useful predictions in the realm of restoration ecology. Trait screening at a site can help predict the success of a particular restoration measure in that community.

AB Recent meta-analyses suggest that ecosystem functioning increases with biodiversity, but contradictory results have been presented for some microbial functions. Moreover, observations of only one function underestimate the functional role of diversity because of species-specific trade-offs in the ability to carry out different functions. We examined multiple functions in batch cultures of natural freshwater bacterial communities with different richness, achieved by a dilution-to-extinction approach. Community composition was assessed by molecular fingerprinting of 16S rRNA and chitinase genes, representing the total community and a trait characteristic for a functional group, respectively. Richness was positively related to abundance and biomass, negatively correlated to cell volumes and unrelated to maximum intrinsic growth rate. The response of chitin and cellulose degradation rates depended on the presence of a single phylotype. We suggest that species identity and community composition rather than richness matters for specific microbial processes.

AB Question: How do aggregate trait values and functional diversity of leaf traits linked to palatability and decomposability change during a woody post-cultural succession spanning 200 years?
   Location: Coastal Marlborough, South Island, New Zealand.
   Methods: The biomass of all woody species was determined in 32 20-m x 20-m plots ranging from 10 to 200 years in time since last disturbance. Species abundances were combined with data on leaf nutrient, secondary metabolite and structural carbohydrate content to calculate biomass-weighted trait means (i.e. aggregate trait values) and functional diversity index values for each plot. Aggregate trait values and functional diversity were regressed on successional age and total live above-ground carbon content to examine functional shifts with succession and one consequence of succession - increasing above-ground carbon.
   Results: Almost all significant regressions between aggregate trait values and both successional age and above-ground carbon indicated a shift toward increased leaf palatability and decomposability during succession. The relationships were all non-linear, with aggregate trait value shifts occurring relatively early in the successional sequence. There was weak evidence for an increase in functional richness with succession, but this was a secondary effect relative to the shifts in aggregate trait values.
   Conclusions: These results are in direct contrast with studies of the early stages of herbaceous post-cultural successions from grasslands to shrublands, which have found a shift towards communities of decreasing palatability and decomposability, suggesting that functional shifts in woody succession may be fundamentally different.

AB The present study investigates potential differences in trait plasticity as an additional contributing mechanism explaining ericaceous shrub dominance during different periods after logging. Two ericaceous species (Kalmia angustifolia, Rhododendron groenlandicum), and black spruce plants (Picea mariana), were submitted to combinations of 3 light levels and 2 levels of nitrogen addition during a simulated growing season of 9 weeks under greenhouse conditions. Plant traits related to light (photosynthesis, leaf mass per unit of area, leaf and aboveground biomass allocation, foliar N concentration) and nutrient acquisition (root mass ratio, specific absorption ratio, absorption of N-15) were measured in response to the manipulation of these resources. The leaf mass per unit of area (LMA) of both ericaceous species was significantly reduced by shading; LMA of Rhododendron and Kalmia was, respectively, 54% and 31% higher in the highest light treatment. The LMA of black spruce was unchanged in response to light level. There were few differences among species in trait response to N addition. Black spruce was characterized by higher nutrient absorption rate and specific absorption rate at higher N levels compared to the 2 ericads. With the exception of LMA, plasticity to light was higher for Kalmia; in contrast, plasticity to N addition was higher for Rhododendron and black spruce. Finally, LMA appears to be a key trait explaining the competitive advantage of ericaceous species (especially Rhododendron) and potential encroachment on forested sites after disturbance.

AB Fish diets provide information that can be used to explore and model complex ecosystems, and infer resource partitioning among species. The exhaustive sampling of prey items captured by each species remains, however, a demanding task. Therefore, predicting diets from other variables, such as functional traits, may be a valuable method. Here, we attempted to predict trophic guild and diet overlap for 35 fish species using 13 ecomorphological traits related to feeding ecology. We compared linear discriminant analysis and random forest (RF) classifiers in their ability to predict trophic guild. We used generalized dissimilarity modelling to predict diet overlap from functional distances between species pairs. All models were evaluated using the same cross-validation procedure. We found that fish trophic guilds were accurately predicted by an RF classifier, even with a limited number of traits, when no more than 7 guilds were defined. Prediction was no longer accurate when finer trophic guilds were created (8 or more guilds), whatever the combination of traits. Furthermore, predicting the degree of diet dissimilarity between species pairs, based on their ecomorphological traits dissimilarities, was profoundly unreliable (at least 76% of unexplained variation). These results suggest that we can predict fish trophic guilds accurately from ecomorphological traits, but not diet overlap and resource partitioning because of inherent versatility in fish diets. More generally, our statistical framework may be applied to any kind of marine organism for which feeding strategies need to be determined from traits.

AB This study investigated the relationships of three major aquatic assemblages (diatom, macroinvertebrate, and fish) and environmental variables, including sub-basin, hydrology, land cover, and water quality variables on multiple scales. Samples were collected at 720 sampling sites on the Korean nationwide scale. Geological variables, including altitude and slope, showed a strong positive correlation with proportions of forest in land cover types and cobbles in substrates, while they were negatively correlated with water quality variables, including conductivity and total phosphorus. Considering the concordance of the different assemblages, species richness of fish and macroinvertebrates displayed significant correlation, and diatoms were significantly correlated with fish. However, diatoms did not show significant correlation with macroinvertebrates. Altitude and slope showed significant correlation with all biological variables of the three assemblages. Macroinvertebrates and fish showed positive relations with large substrate sizes. Indices of diatoms and macroinvertebrates well reflected the perturbation of water quality variables. However, fish indices showed a relatively low association with water quality variables, compared with those of diatoms and macroinvertebrates. These patterns were also confirmed by the ordination and prediction of biological indices with environmental variables through the learning process of a self-organizing map as well as random forest. Overall, our study supports the concept of multi-scale habitat filters and functional organization in streams, and is consistent with the recommended use of multiple biological indices with more than one assemblage for the assessment of the biotic integrity of aquatic ecosystems.

AB In many animal species, chiefly birds and some marine mammals, the repertoire of acoustic communication signals represents learned features of the behavioural phenotype, acquired and transmitted across generations as cultural traditions. These signals often are found to vary spatially among sub-species or local populations (e.g., dialects), as well as among smaller social groupings (colonies, flocks, pods, clans). Moreover, within the whole repertoire of different vocal signals of a species there can be differences in the patterns of spatial variation from one type of vocalization to another. A previous study of birdsong, for example, showed that males had two different kinds of song, functionally differing and with discordant patterns of geographic variation. This, and other studies describing spatial distributions of different elements of a learned vocal repertoire, suggests a general hypothesis that functional differences among an ensemble of cultural traits may be manifest as differences in spatial variation. My extension of this hypothesis is that among such a suite of cultural traits those of similar function will tend to co-vary spatially. In this report, I use three vocalizations of a parrot species to test this hypothesis. I recorded vocalizations of the Australian ringneck (Platycercus (= Barnardius) zonarius), at 49 sites across three subspecies distributions and quantified variation in the acoustic features of their vocal signals. Two of the vocal signals have similar function and, according to the hypothesis, should follow similar patterns of spatial variation, whereas the third signal has a differing function and is not expected to vary spatially in concordance with the other two signals. These predicted patterns were substantially upheld.

AB Species assemblages and natural communities are increasingly impacted by changes in the frequency and severity of extreme climatic events. Here we propose a brief overview of expected and demonstrated direct and indirect impacts of extreme events on animal communities. We show that differential impacts on basic biological parameters of individual species can lead to strong changes in community composition and structure with the potential to considerably modify the functional traits of the community. Sudden disequilibria have even been shown to induce irreversible shifts in marine ecosystems, while cascade effects on various taxonomic groups have been highlighted in Mediterranean forests. Indirect effects of extreme climatic events are expected when event-induced habitat changes (e. g. soil stability, vegetation composition, water flows altered by droughts, floods or hurricanes) have differential consequences on species assembled within the communities. Moreover, in increasing the amplitude of trophic mismatches, extreme events are likely to turn many systems into ecological traps under climate change. Finally, we propose a focus on the potential impacts of an extreme heat wave on local assemblages as an empirical case study, analysing monitoring data on breeding birds collected in France. In this example, we show that despite specific populations were differently affected by local temperature anomalies, communities seem to be unaffected by a sudden heat wave. These results suggest that communities are tracking climate change at the highest possible rate [Current Zoology 57 (3): 406-413, 2011].

AB Although eutrophication and biological invasions are recognized as important elements of global change, few studies have assessed how their synergism can affect structural and functional traits of marine ecosystems. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of seawater nutrient enrichment on the spread of the introduced Chlorophyta Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea and the interactive effects of nutritional enrichment and C. racemosa invasion on the native macroalgal assemblages of a subtidal rocky bottom. To achieve these objectives, a manipulative field experiment was carried out at 24 m depth in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea by adding C. racemosa and supplying the water column with nutrients. The following treatments were applied: non-manipulated assemblages, nutrient enrichment, addition of C. racemosa, and both nutrient enrichment and addition of C. racemosa. Results showed that C. racemosa spread was enhanced by nutrient enrichment. Moreover, a significant interaction between nutritional increase and C. racemosa invasion was detected: the effects of C. racemosa invasion on native macroalgal assemblages were amplified by nutrient enrichment. Results suggested that synergism between effects of different anthropogenic impacts can have severe consequences on the integrity of marine ecosystems.

AB Ecological theory suggests that environmental filtering (the survival or elimination of species in the community in response to environmental constraints) is a key process in the species assemblages of communities. Environmental filters, such as sand movement and soil salinity in coastal dunes and beaches, may result in shared ecological tolerances and functional types, independently of phylogenetic and evolutionary history. In 19 beach-foredune sites located along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico we studied plant functional composition and diversity of vascular plants. Functional groups were determined with a classification analysis. Relative importance values and diversity indices of species and functional groups were compared with ANOVA tests. We distinguished 5 groups: a group of species tolerant to soil salinity and burial, most abundant on accreting beaches; a group of species tolerant only to burial, which were abundant on all coasts; and 3 groups that lacked specific responses to burial and soil salinity and were most abundant on stable and erosive coasts. Accreting foredunes showed the lowest species richness and functional diversity, because only a few species were tolerant to burial and soil salinity. In the foredune environment, sediment dynamics and geomorphological processes act as environmental filters that largely determine the floristic and functional composition of the community.

AB Background and aims Re-introduction of large grazers in the few remaining natural and semi-natural grasslands are thought to be an effective management tool to prevent dominance of late successional plant species and restoration of plant biodiversity. The main objective of this study was to test whether the introduction of large herbivores retard the succession by reducing the abundance of highly competitive tall species and whether it is accompanied with changes in plant community composition and spatial distribution of plant species.
   Methods In order to test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of grazing by large herbivores on vegetation at three hierarchical levels: individual plant species, emergent groups of functionally similar herbaceous plant species, and the main gradients of plant community composition. Study sites were thirteen spatially separated, dry coastal dune grasslands in western Belgium and north-western France.
   Key results Grazing had a predominantly negative effect on high competitive dominant species and led to changes in composition of emergent groups toward less competitive plant species. Additionally, these changes in plant community composition were accompanied with changes in spatial distribution patterns of individual plant species and community richness.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that the current grazing management applied in these nature reserves is able to prevent the expansion of dominant highly competitive species and establishment of functionally different plant species.

AB We address the question of whether seaweed zonation can be characterized in terms of light absorption, pigmentation, photosynthetic parameters, photoinhibition, and thallus structure. Based on 32 seaweed species from the Pacific coast of southern Chile, intertidal assemblages exhibited higher light requirements for photosynthesis (E-k) and lower thallus light absorptances than sub-tidal algae. E-k values were lower than the highest measured irradiances at the corresponding natural depths, suggesting that photosynthesis in these organisms could potentially occur at lower depths. During summer, 1% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reached a depth of 23 m, while UV-B and UV-A wavelengths were completely attenuated at <3 and 6 m, respectively. Overall, the photobiological adaptations were associated with depth, morphology, and taxonomic group. Photoinhibition was similar in algae from different depths, although recovery was higher in upper littoral algae than in infra- and sublittoral species. The characteristics conferring competitive abilities in light use and light stress tolerance were not, or only partially, related to the classical Littler form-function model. The filamentous and foliose forms were able to acclimate rapidly to changing light and physical stress in the supralittoral zone. For infralittoral kelps living in a highly dynamic environment, higher cross-sectional area and enhanced in vivo light absorption were coupled with morphological features (e.g. massive thallus) that are advantageous in withstanding e.g. water movement. By contrast, the rapid physiological adjustments that allow algae to endure solar stress (e.g. photochemical down-regulation) were strongly dependent on the position on the shore but not on gross morphology.

AB P>The resurrection plant Craterostigma plantagineum is able to withstand desiccation of its vegetative tissues and is found in areas with variable water availability. The closely related species Lindernia brevidens and Lindernia subracemosa are both endemic to montane rainforests of coastal Africa, but remarkably L. brevidens is tolerant to desiccation.
   We studied the regulation of the desiccation-related LEA-like 11-24 gene at multiple levels in closely related species in order to investigate the conservation of mechanisms involved in desiccation tolerance.
   The dehydration-responsive transcription of the LEA-like 11-24 gene is differentially regulated in these plants. Comparison of the LEA-like 11-24 core promoter regions revealed that promoters have different activities, but some functional cis-acting elements are conserved between species. Upon dehydration, LEA-like 11-24 proteins are phosphorylated at different levels and phosphorylation sites are not conserved among the three LEA-like 11-24 proteins.
   Differences in the regulation of the LEA-like 11-24 gene in the studied plant species appear to be the result of mutations that occurred during evolution. We postulate that L. brevidens will eventually lose the ability to survive vegetative desiccation, given that this trait appears not to be essential for survival.

AB In spite of the relative importance of groundwater in costal dune systems, studies concerning the responses of vegetation to ground water (GW) availability variations, particularly in Mediterranean regions, are scarce. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to compare the responses of co-occurring species possessing different functional traits, to changes in GW levels (i.e. the lowering of GW levels) in a sand dune ecosystem. For that, five sites were established within a 1 km(2) area in a meso-mediterranean sand dune ecosystem dominated by a Pinus pinaster forest. Due to natural topographic variability and anthropogenic GW exploitation, substantial variability in depth to GW between sites was found. Under these conditions it was possible to identify the degree of usage and dependence on GW of different plant species (two deep-rooted trees, a drought adapted shrub, a phreatophyte and a non-native woody invader) and how GW dependence varied seasonally and between the heterogeneous sites. Results indicated that the plant species had differential responses to changes in GW depth according to specific functional traits (i.e. rooting depth, leaf morphology, and water use strategy). Species comparison revealed that variability in pre-dawn water potential (Psi(pre)) and bulk leaf delta C-13 was related to site differences in GW use in the deep-rooted (Pinus pinaster, Myrica faya) and phreatophyte (Salix repens) species. However, such variation was more evident during spring than during summer drought. The exotic invader, Acacia longifolia, which does not possess a very deep root system, presented the largest seasonal variability in Psi(pre) and bulk leaf delta C-13. In contrast, the response of Corema album, an endemic understory drought-adapted shrub, seemed to be independent of water availability across seasons and sites. Thus, the susceptibility to lowering of GW due to anthropogenic exploitation, in plant species from sand dunes, is variable, being particularly relevant for deep rooted species and phreatophytes, which seem to depend heavily on access to GW.

AB P>1. We introduce a novel method that analyses environmental filtering of plant species in a geographic and phylogenetic context. By connecting species traits with phylogeny, traits with environment, and environment with geography, this comprehensive approach partitions the ecological and evolutionary processes that influence community assembly.
   2. Our analysis extends RLQ ordination, which connects site attributes in matrix R (here environmental variables and spatial positions) with species attributes in matrix Q (here biological traits and phylogenetic positions), through the composition of sites in terms of species presences or abundances (matrix L). This methodology, which explores and identifies environmental filters that organize communities, was developed to answer four questions: which combinations of trait states are filtered by the environment, which lineages are affected by these filters, which environmental variables contribute to the assemblage of local communities and where do these filters act?
   3. At La Mafragh in north-eastern Algeria, our approach shows that plant species traits were distributed according to environmental filters associated with a salinity gradient. Traits associated with the salinity gradient were convergent among Juncaceae, Cyperaceae and Amaranthaceae. The observed phylogenetic and trait patterns were related to how species survived the xeric season. Juncaceae and Cyperaceae, being perennials and anemogamous, tolerate the xeric hot season by restricting their range to the humid centre of the study area (where conditions are close to a subtropical climate). Several Amaranthaceae species co-occur with the Juncaceae and Cyperaceae in two areas with the highest salinity. Most dicots were observed at higher elevations (up to 7 m a.s.l.), had hairy structures that can retain water and reflect solar radiation and were mostly annual or biennial, completing their life cycle before the onset of the xeric season.
   4. Synthesis. Our methodology describes environmental filters in terms of identified combinations of traits and environmental factors. It allows spatial and phylogenetic signals to be determined by identifying convergent and conserved patterns in the evolution of traits and spatial scales that structured the environment. Our statistical framework is generic and can be readily extended to a wide range of exciting issues, such as host-parasite, plant-pollinator and predator-prey interactions.

AB Life cycles of phytoplankton species have been selected over a long evolutionary history and represent a key element for our understanding of their ecology and natural history and for improving our comprehension of ocean functioning. A species can alternate in its life cycle between four distinct major phases: growth, sex, quiescence and cell death. This implies that the population of a phytoplankton species found in any particular water sample will contain cells that undergo different fates, have strong differentiation in physiology and have different functional roles even if they are genetically identical. The factors regulating transitions among the different phases are still largely unknown but have direct impacts on the ecological distribution of species and on their biogeochemical function. Focused research efforts in recent years have begun to reveal emerging patterns in the variability of phytoplankton life cycle traits. This research has relied both on careful observations in culture and at sea and on making use of new genomics- and transcriptomics-based tools. The study of phytoplankton in the context of their life cycle characteristics opens up new opportunities to address fundamental questions about the physiology and cell biology of these important organisms and creates a new evolutionary and ecological framework for defining phytoplankton functional groups.

AB Habitat change induced by organic enrichment is a growing concern for the sustainability of benthic communities in coastal aquatic environments. This case study describes the spatial and temporal response patterns and the recovery potential of low-diversity benthic communities to organic enrichment at two fish farm locations, during the rearing periods (15 and 20 years, respectively) and the following recovery periods (2 years). The spatial extent of disturbance differed depending on the hydromorphological characteristics of the rearing sites, but degraded macrobenthic communities close to both fish farms were recorded soon after the activity started. Continued organic enrichment resulted in high species turnover-rates and in an altered benthic community composition at both locations. After fish farm abatement, a partial recovery was detected in species richness, but abundance and biomass values were reduced and changes in structural composition remained. Alterations in benthic biological traits were observed at both fish farm locations, implying that organic enrichment might cause changes in benthic community function within low-diversity benthic communities.

AB P>The focus of the trait-based approach to study community ecology has mostly been on trait comparisons at the interspecific level. Here we quantified intraspecific variation and covariation of leaf mass per area (LMA) and wood density (WD) in monospecific forests of the widespread tree species Nothofagus pumilio to determine its magnitude and whether it is related to environmental conditions and ontogeny. We also discuss probable mechanisms controlling the trait variation found.
   We collected leaf and stem woody tissues from 30-50 trees of different ages (ontogeny) from each of four populations at differing elevations (i.e. temperatures) and placed at each of three locations differing in soil moisture.
   The total variation in LMA (coefficient of variation (CV) = 21.14%) was twice that of WD (CV = 10.52%). The total variation in traits was never less than 23% when compared with interspecific studies. Differences in elevation (temperature) for the most part explained variation in LMA, while differences in soil moisture and ontogeny explained the variation in WD. Traits covaried similarly in the altitudinal gradient only.
   Functional traits of N. pumilio exhibited nonnegligible variation; LMA varied for the most part with temperature, while WD mostly varied with moisture and ontogeny. We demonstrate that environmental variation can cause important trait variation without species turnover.

AB Background: High values of specific leaf area (SLA) are generally associated with high maximal growth rates in resource-rich conditions, such as mesic climates and fertile soils. However, fire may complicate this relationship since its frequency varies with both climate and soil fertility, and fire frequency selects for regeneration strategies (resprouting versus seeding) that are not independent of resource-acquisition strategies. Shared ancestry is also expected to affect the distribution of resource-use and regeneration traits.
   Aims: We examined climate, soil, and fire as drivers of community-level variation in a key functional trait, SLA, in chaparral in California.
   Methods: We quantified the phylogenetic, functional, and environmental non-independence of key traits for 87 species in 115 plots.
   Results: Among species, SLA was higher in resprouters than seeders, although not after phylogeny correction. Among communities, mean SLA was lower in harsh interior climates, but in these climates it was higher on more fertile soils and on more recently burned sites; in mesic coastal climates, mean SLA was uniformly high despite variation in soil fertility and fire history.
   Conclusions: We conclude that because important correlations exist among both species traits and environmental filters, interpreting the functional and phylogenetic structure of communities may require an understanding of complex interactive effects.

AB Key recent developments in litter decomposition research are reviewed. Long-term inter-site experiments indicate that temperature and moisture influence early rates of litter decomposition primarily by determining the plants present, suggesting that climate change effects will be small unless they alter the plant forms present. Thresholds may exist at which single factors control decay rate. Litter decomposes faster where the litter type naturally occurs. Elevated CO(2) concentrations have little effect on litter decomposition rates. Plant tissues are not decay-resistant; it is microbial and biochemical transformations of materials into novel recalcitrant compounds rather than selective preservation of recalcitrant compounds that creates stable organic matter. Altering single characteristics of litter will not substantially alter decomposition rates. Nitrogen addition frequently leads to greater stabilization into humus through a combination of chemical reactions and enzyme inhibition. To sequester more C in soil, we need to consider not how to slow decomposition, but rather how to divert more litter into humus through microbial and chemical reactions rather than allowing it to decompose. The optimal strategy is to have litter transformed into humic substances and then chemically or physically protected in mineral soil. Adding N through fertilization and N-fixing plants is a feasible means of stimulating humification.

AB Many fish communities are heavily exploited and rebuilding plans need to be implemented for depleted species. Within an ecosystem approach to management, development of rebuilding plans should include consideration of the expected consequences of the rebuilding of the target species on the rest of the marine community. Using size- and trait-based single-species and community models, a general assessment is made of the direct and indirect ecological consequences of a rebuilding plan based on a reduction in fishing mortality. If fishing mortality is sufficiently reduced, the time-scale of rebuilding is in the order of the time to reach maturation of an individual, and the expected trajectory can be reliably predicted by a single-species model. Indirect effects of increased abundance are a decrease in individuals in the trophic levels above and below the target species. The decrease in biomass of the neighbouring trophic levels is expected to be much smaller than the increase in the target species and to be largest in species on the trophic level above. We discuss which effects could be responsible when a rebuilding plan does not result in the expected increase and how our results could be applied in a practical management situation.

AB Forecasting responses of benthic community structure and function to anthropogenic climate change is an emerging scientific challenge. Characterizing benthic species by biological attributes (traits) that are responsive to temperature and streamflow conditions can support a mechanistic approach for assessing the potential ecological responses to climate change. However, nonclimatic environmental factors also structure benthic communities and may mitigate transient climatic conditions, and these must be considered in evaluating potential impacts of climate change. Here we used macroinvertebrate and environmental data for 279 reference-quality sites spanning 12 states in the western US. For each sampling location, we described 45 environmental variables that spanned reach to catchment scales and that represented contemporary climate drivers, hydrologic metrics, and nonclimatic habitat features, as well as purely spatial metrics. We described benthic community composition at each site in terms of 7 species traits, including those considered sensitive to temperature increases and streamflow changes. All combined environmental variables explained 67% of the total trait variation across the sites, and catchment-scale climatic and hydrologic variables independently accounted for 19%. Sites were clustered into 3 community types based on trait composition, and a classification-tree analysis confirmed that climatic and hydrologic variables were important in partitioning these groups. Sensitivity of benthic communities to projected climate change was assessed by quantifying the proportion of taxa at sites having the traits of either cold stenothermy or obligate rheophily. Regression-tree analysis showed that temperature and hydrologic variables mostly accounted for the differences in proportion of sensitivity traits across the sites. We examined the vulnerability of sites to climate change by superimposing regional-scale projections of late-21(st)-century temperature and runoff change on the spatial distribution of temperature- and runoff-sensitive assemblages. Sites with high proportions of cold stenotherms and obligate rheophiles occur throughout the western US, but the degree of temperature and runoff change is projected to be greatest for reference sites in the Upper Colorado River and Great Basin. Thus, our results suggest that traits-based sensitivity coupled with intraregional variation in projected changes in temperature and runoff will cause reference sites in the western US to be differentially vulnerable to future climate change.

AB Increasing levels of environmental stress due to global warming and eutrophication, and concerns about an unparalleled global diversity loss, have triggered new interest in the question whether the stability of ecosystem properties depends on population dynamics of dominant species or on compensatory growth of rare species. Recent meta-analyses suggest that compensatory dynamics are rare in natural systems. Experimental results, however, indicate that the interdependence of stressor regime, species traits, and species richness determines which mechanisms stabilise communities. Stability will depend on population dynamics of dominant species, if they remain the best performers regardless of disturbance. If dominant species become rare or lost, compensatory growth of rare species will insure natural communities against complete failure. Salinity is an important stressor governing growth and distribution of phytoplankton in brackish ecosystems, and its impact on coastal aquatic ecosystems is likely to change due to global warming. We performed two short-term experiments to investigate the effects of salinity stress on community structure and biomass production of natural phytoplankton communities collected in tidally influenced and polymictic Lake Waihola (New Zealand). The lake was brackish when the inoculum for the first experiment was collected. The inoculum for the second experiment originated from a fresh water situation. In both experiments, the phytoplankton assemblage was exposed to a salinity gradient ranging from 0 to 5. To assess the importance of dominance and compensatory growth, we determined biomass production, species richness, diversity, evenness and dominance indices, and species specific growth rates. Biomass production in our experiments was determined by dominant species. Anabaena flos-aquae dominated in the first experiment, and Asterionella formosa in the second experiment. Despite the importance of these species, we found significant growth responses of rare and abundant species. Even if these species showed high growth rates, biomass production was carried by the dominant species as long as the salinity level allowed them to grow. When the salinity level was detrimental to the growth of the dominant species, reduced dominance and increased diversity indices emphasised the importance of compensatory growth of rare species. The salinity stress applied in our experiments was strong enough to change the hierarchy of successful functional traits, which affected community structure and biomass production of the plankton communities. If the predicted sea water rise, increasing frequency of storm tides, rising water temperatures, and altered precipitation and run-off cause the salinity of coastal aquatic ecosystems to change, major changes in community composition, diversity and dominance structure of planktonic primary producers might be expected.

AB In oxygen-limited marine ecosystems cooperation between marine nitrifiers and anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria is of importance to nitrogen cycling. Strong evidence for cooperation between anammox bacteria and nitrifiers has been provided by environmental studies but little is known about the development of such communities, the effects of environmental parameters and the physiological traits of their constituents. In this study, a marine laboratory model system was developed. Cooperation between marine nitrifiers and anammox bacteria was induced by incremental exposure of a marine anammox community dominated by Scalindua species to oxygen in a bioreactor set-up under high ammonium (40 mM influent) conditions. Changes in the activities of the relevant functional groups (anammox bacteria, aerobic ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers) were monitored by batch tests. Changes in community composition were followed by Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) and by amplification and sequencing of 16S rRNA and amoA genes. A co-culture of Scalindua sp., an aerobic ammonia-oxidizing Nitrosomonas-like species, and an aerobic (most likely Nitrospira sp.) nitrite oxidizer was obtained. Aerobic ammonia oxidizers became active immediately upon exposure to oxygen and their numbers increased 60-fold. Crenarchaea closely related to the ammonia-oxidizer Candidatus 'Nitrosopumilus maritimus' were detected in very low numbers and their contribution to nitrification was assumed negligible. Activity of anammox bacteria was not inhibited by the increased oxygen availability. The developed marine model system proved an effective tool to study the interactions between marine anammox bacteria and nitrifiers and their responses to changes in environmentally relevant conditions.

AB The aim of the paper is the state-of-the-art assessment of the alien flora of Greece and its traits. The dataset consists of a total of 343 alien taxa, including 49 archaeophytes. The taxonomy, life traits and habitat of the 294 neophytes are analysed vs their naturalisation status. Out of the 122 (41%) naturalised neophytes, 50 are identified as exhibiting invasive behaviour. Poaceae, Asteraceae, Amaranthaceae, Solanaceae, Fabaceae, and Polygonaceae are the plant families richest in alien taxa. The majority of them are of American origin, followed by those of Asiatic and Mediterranean origin. The neophytes are predominantly herbs, most of them annuals. Yet, the perennial life cycle is equally frequent with the annual one and the proportion of phanerophytes in the alien flora is increased compared to the one of the native flora. Regarding flowering traits, most of the aliens have a long flowering period (over 1 month) and flower in late spring, summer and autumn, when few of the native plants are in bloom. Vertebrate zoochory and anemochory are the two dispersal modes mostly utilised by the alien plants (43 and 28%, respectively), while more than one dispersal mechanisms are functional for 56% of them. Artificial habitats have the highest frequencies of alien plants. The natural habitats with the highest numbers of aliens are the coastal ones and inland surface waters. Opuntia ficus-barbarica, Ailanthus altissima, Oxalis pes-caprae, Erigeron bonariensis, Amaranthus albus and Symphyotrichum squamatum are typical cases of plants characterised as invasive, having established in almost all the habitat groups identified. The diversity of the ecological characteristics of the plants suggests a potential of impacts that needs to be further assessed.

AB Along the Italian maritime foredunes there are two different morphotypes of Cable maritima Scop. subsp. maritima differing in leaf shape: one type is characterized by entire lamina, while the other one shows pinnatifid leaves. Therefore, this study was performed to analyze leaf morpho-functional characters of both C. maritima morphotypes in order to highlight the peculiar adaptations to the ecological conditions of sand dune environments and to compare the two different morphological types.
   The morpho-functional traits analyzed are leaf roll, general morphology of epidermis, vesicular cells, salt crystals, stomatal apparatus, stomatal density (SD), hydathodes, mesophyll, idioblasts, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). The most interesting anatomical adaptations to sand dune habitats are thick epidermal cuticle; high stomatal density; epidermal vesicular cells involved in water storage, sunlight reflexion and together with hydathodes in salt elimination; high development of palisade and water storage parenchyma; bundle sheath typical of C-4 leaf anatomy. Differences in several leaf characters between the two morphotypes seem to suggest that pinnatifid morphotype is more resistant to stress and environmental disturbance than the entire type. The analysis of C. maritima distribution in two different coastal traits affected by progradation or erosional processes confirmed this hypothesis.

AB In applied river ecology it is implicitly assumed that community structure is a surrogate for functional properties. To test this hypothesis, 26 sites were sampled for macroinvertebrates in a Central Italian stream system impacted by 13 trout farms (1 upstream and 1 downstream site per facility). We used a fuzzy-coding approach of biological traits combined with species distribution analysis. Trout farm locally impacted the structure of macroinvertebrate communities, but serial disturbances at the stream system scale did not affect the overall regional diversity pattern.
   Impacted sites had species with large body size, which fed upon microorganisms and fine detritus, and which showed asexual reproduction. Least impact sites hosted small-sized invertebrates showing sexual reproduction, and feeding upon plant material and/or algae.

AB Large-statured invasive grasses (LSIGs) constitute a distinct functional group with characteristic life history traits that facilitate colonization and aggressive growth in aquatic ecosystems, particularly those modified by human activities. These species typically form monocultures in the systems they invade and have wide-ranging and negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem processes. In March 2008, a special symposium was held as part of the Western Society of Weed Scientists annual meeting to synthesize our current knowledge of the ecological impacts and management of two notorious LSIGs: Arundo donax and Phragmites australis. In this volume of Invasive Plant Science and Management, symposium participants provide articles summarizing existing knowledge, recent research progress, and research needs for these two taxa. Here, we summarize the basic biology of these species and suggest the use of a more holistic approach to deal with the effects and management of LSIG invasions.

AB South African coastal dune forests are young, highly disturbed subtropical communities where conventional models of forest dynamics may be challenged. We tested predictions from the gap-phase regeneration model by comparing seedlings of three common species representing contrasting regeneration strategies: Acacia karroo as a ruderal, Celtis africana as a coloniser of forest gaps, and Diospyros natalensis as a late-successional species. We grew seedlings under contrasting light and nitrogen levels in a greenhouse and in the field for 1 year to compare their growth and survival rates, allocation and photosynthetic traits. Species' growth rates generally followed the expected order: Acacia > Celtis > Diospyros, but Acacia responded strongly to light and Celtis responded strongly to nitrogen, leading to cross-overs in growth rates. The plasticity of allocation and photosynthesis did not clearly differentiate the strategies, although it was greater in the light-demanding species. Acacia and Celtis tended to survive better in Acacia stands than in forest plots. Leaf-level light compensation points (LCPs) were similar for the three species in most conditions, but auxiliary data suggest Diospyros has a lower whole-plant LCP than Acacia. Growth rates and LCPs were lower than most of those reported for primary-forest species in the literature, suggesting an unusual degree of shade-tolerance in this habitat. We discuss reasons why variation in shade-tolerance may be less important here than in the prevailing model for forest regeneration and suggest other biotic factors that may help differentiate regeneration niches.

AB Exotic and invasive woody vines are major environmental weeds of riparian areas, rainforest communities and remnant natural vegetation in coastal eastern Australia, where they smother standing vegetation, including large trees, and cause canopy collapse. We investigated, through glasshouse resource manipulative experiments, the ecophysiological traits that might facilitate faster growth, better resource acquisition and/or utilization and thus dominance of four exotic and invasive vines of South East Queensland, Australia, compared with their native counterparts. Relative growth rate was not significantly different between the two groups but water use efficiency (WUE) was higher in the native species while the converse was observed for light use efficiency (quantum efficiency, AQE) and maximum photosynthesis on a mass basis (A(maxmass)). The invasive species, as a group, also exhibited higher respiration load, higher light compensation point and higher specific leaf area. There were stronger correlations of leaf traits and greater structural (but not physiological) plasticity in invasive species than in their native counterparts. The scaling coefficients of resource use efficiencies (WUE, AQE and respiration efficiency) as well as those of fitness (biomass accumulated) versus many of the performance traits examined did not differ between the two species-origin groups, but there were indications of significant shifts in elevation (intercept values) and shifts along common slopes in many of these relationships - signalling differences in carbon economy (revenue returned per unit energy invested) and/or resource usage. Using ordination and based on 14 ecophysiological attributes, a fair level of separation between the two groups was achieved (51.5% explanatory power), with AQE, light compensation point, respiration load, WUE, specific leaf area and leaf area ratio, in decreasing order, being the main drivers. This study suggests similarity in trait plasticity, especially for physiological traits, but there appear to be fundamental differences in carbon economy and resource conservation between native and invasive vine species.

AB Ecosystem assessment and monitoring requires the development and application of suitable indicators, i.e. they need to be (i) reliable and capable of simplifying complex relationships, (ii) quantifiable and transparent in order to enable an easy communication, and (iii) fit for the purpose of indication. These requirements are scarcely fulfilled in current ecosystem assessment and monitoring efforts to address the requirements of international biodiversity conventions. Here we present and test a set of seven criteria towards an improved framework for ecosystems indication with particular emphasis on the indication of biodiversity and ecosystem services: purpose of indication, indicator type according to the EEA's Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response scheme, direct/indirect linkages to biodiversity and ecosystem services, spatial scale and scalability across scales, applicability of benchmarks/reference values, availability of data and protocols, and applicability of remote sensing. The criteria are tested using 24 indicators of ecosystem assessment and monitoring at the global, continental and regional scale. Based on the general trends revealed by our evaluation, we present recommendations to streamline and improve ecosystem indication with respect to international biodiversity conventions. The implementation of our recommendations does require concerted international effort, comparable, for instance, to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Europe.

AB This study presents a comparative analysis of protected and exploited Mediterranean Sea food webs using standardized ecological models of two ecosystems: the Central-North Adriatic Sea (highly exploited) and the Miramare Natural Marine Reserve (Northern Adriatic Sea, protected since 1986). Food webs are analysed in terms of structural and functional traits including trophic levels, transfer efficiency, trophic role of species and keystoneness, trophic spectra and other synthetic ecological indicators. Our results highlight similarities between food webs of the Adriatic Sea, differences that are likely due to the impact of fishing and differences that should be related to other factors. Analysis of biomass distribution along functional groups and of trophic spectra indicates that protected area presents higher mean trophic level of the community, higher biomasses, lower production and generally lower transfer efficiency than fished area. Our results indicate that measures of food web complexity (system omnivory index and ascendency), as well as pelagic/demersal and fish/invertebrates biomass ratios are higher in the protected area than in exploited ecosystem due to fishing-induced changes. Thus, this study highlights that marine protected areas can efficiently contribute to maintain structural and functional traits of marine ecosystems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Marine ecosystems are critically challenged by human activities, urgently calling for better management practices. It has been proposed that conspicuous top predators such as seabirds may be used as ecological indicators. This approach requires intimate knowledge of relationships connecting seabird parameters to other ecosystem components (i.e., population plasticity, underlined by individual reaction norms), information which remains scarce. Furthermore, if seabirds are to be used as long-term indicators, the strength of the average plastic response in a studied population has to be sustained through time and space. This second aspect has so far been startlingly neglected, although previous studies underline shifts in the plasticity of seabird traits and detail the tools allowing an evolutionary and ecological study of plasticity in bird populations. Building upon these advances, we argue that gradual or sudden spatiotemporal changes in seabird phenotypic plasticity should not be neglected when designing monitoring schemes. We conclude that seabirds are best used as qualitative sentinels, rather than as quantitative indicators.

AB Human activities have strong impacts on ecosystem functioning through their effect on abiotic factors and on biodiversity. There is also growing evidence that species functional traits link changes in species composition and shifts in ecosystem processes. Hence, it appears to be of utmost importance to quantify modifications in the functional structure of species communities after human disturbance in addition to changes in taxonomic structure. Despite this fact, there is still little consensus on the actual impacts of human-mediated habitat alteration on the components of biodiversity, which include species functional traits. Therefore, we studied changes in taxonomic diversity (richness and evenness), in functional diversity, and in functional specialization of estuarine fish communities facing drastic environmental and habitat alterations. The Terminos Lagoon (Gulf of Mexico) is a tropical estuary of primary concern for its biodiversity, its habitats, and its resource supply, which have been severely impacted by human activities. Fish communities were sampled in four zones of the Terminos Lagoon 18 years apart (1980 and 1998). Two functions performed by fish (food acquisition and locomotion) were studied through the measurement of 16 functional traits. Functional diversity of fish communities was quantified using three independent components: richness, evenness, and divergence. Additionally, we measured the degree of functional specialization in fish communities. We used a null model to compare the functional and the taxonomic structure of fish communities between 1980 and 1998. Among the four largest zones studied, three did not show strong functional changes. In the northern part of the lagoon, we found an increase in fish richness but a significant decrease of functional divergence and functional specialization. We explain this result by a decline of specialized species (i.e., those with particular combinations of traits), while newly occurring species are redundant with those already present. The species that decreased in abundance have functional traits linked to seagrass habitats that regressed consecutively to increasing eutrophication. The paradox found in our study highlights the need for a multifaceted approach in the assessment of biodiversity changes in communities under pressure.

AB While compositional diversity is a common metric for assessing human impacts on aquatic communities, functional diversity is scarcely employed, though highly desirable from the perspective of the European Water Framework Directive. Using abundance data from 99 minimally disturbed sites (i.e., no or very weak anthropogenic impact) from a national survey, we studied the spatial variability of compositional and functional biodiversity metrics across a predefined ecoregional classification. Metrics of compositional diversity comprised taxonomic and EPT richness and Simpson diversity. Functional diversity metrics were based on Rao's Quadratic Entropy (RQE), which described the differences among benthic invertebrate genera in eleven biological traits (e.g., size, life cycle, reproduction types, feeding habits). Using generalized linear models we show that taxonomic richness may vary greatly across ecoregions, contrasting with Simpson diversity and functional metrics that varied weakly in response to natural environmental variability. Functional diversity metrics, because of their stability in response to natural environmental variability, may be useful tools for assessing human impairment to ecosystem function. We further tested the response of functional diversity metrics to a specific human impact (sewage) and demonstrated significant modifications of functional diversity downstream of sewage pollution. Further investigations are required to test the ability of functional diversity metrics to precisely and accurately indicate different types of human impacts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB P>1. Intraguild predation is widespread in nature despite its potentially destabilizing effect on food web dynamics.
   2. Anti-predator inducible defences affect both birth and death rates of populations and have the potential to substantially modify food web dynamics and possibly increase persistence of intaguild prey.
   3. In a chemostat experiment, we investigated the long-term effects of inducible defences on the dynamics of aquatic microbial food webs consisting of an intraguild predator, intraguild prey, and a basal resource. We controlled environmental conditions and selected strains of intraguild prey that varied in the strength of expressed inducible defences.
   4. We found that intraguild prey with a stronger tendency to induce an anti-predator morphology persist for significantly longer periods of time. In addition, model selection analysis implied that flexibility in defensive phenotype (inducibility itself) is most likely the factor responsible for the enhanced persistence.
   5. As patterns at the community level often emerge as a result of the life-history traits of individuals, we propose that inducible defences increase the persistence of populations and may contribute to the widespread occurrence of theoretically unstable intraguild predation systems in nature.

AB Aims
   For assisting faster restoration of damaged or severely disturbed coastal ecosystems, selected mangrove species have been planted on previously mangrove-inhabited sites of the tropical and subtropical coasts of southern China. The objective of this study was to understand the stand dynamics of the planted mangroves and their functional traits in comparison with natural mangrove forests under similar site conditions.
   Methods
   Species composition, stand density, tree size distribution, and aboveground production were investigated along three transects in a 50-year-old planted mangrove stand and three transects in an adjacent natural mangrove stand in Shenzhen Bay, South China. Measurements were made on tree distribution by species, stand structure, and aboveground biomass (AGB) distribution. Analyses were performed on the spatial patterns of tree size distribution and species association.
   Important Findings
   We found that the planted and natural mangrove stands did not differ in stand density, average diameter at breast height (DBH), species composition, and AGB. Spatial distribution of AGB and frequency at species level were also similar between the planted and natural stands. However, the traits in stand structure were more variable in the planted stand than in the natural stand, indicating higher spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the development and succession of planted mangroves. Geostatistical analyses show that both DBH and AGB were spatially auto-correlated within a specific range in the direction perpendicular to coastline. More than 60%, of the variance in these attributes was due to spatial autocorrelation. The Ripley's K-function analysis shows that the two dominant species, Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina, clumped in broader scales in the natural stand than in the planted stand and displayed significant interspecific competition across the whole transect. It is suggested that interspecific competition interacts with spatial autocorrelation as the underlying mechanism shaping the mangrove structure. This study demonstrates that at age 50, mangrove plantations can perform similarly in stand structure, spatial arrangement of selected stand characteristics and species associations to the natural mangrove forests.

AB Many studies on invasive species show reduced native densities, but few studies measure trait-mediated effects as mechanisms for changes in native growth rates and population dynamics. Where native prey face invasive predators, mechanisms for phenotypic change include selective predation, or induced behavioral or morphological plasticity. Invasive green crabs, Carcinus maenas, have contributed to declines in native soft-shell clams, Mya arenaria, in coastal New England, USA. We tested the hypothesis that clam ability to detect chemical cues from predators or damaged conspecifics would induce greater burrowing depth as a refuge from invasive crabs, and greater burrowing would require increased siphon growth. To determine how crab predation affected clam survivorship and phenotypic traits in the field, clams in exclosure, open, and crab enclosure plots were compared. Crab predation reduced clam density, and surviving clams were deeper and larger, with longer siphons. To determine whether the mechanism for these results was selective predation or induced plasticity, phenotypes were compared between clams exposed to chemical cues from crab predation and clams exposed to seawater in laboratory and field experiments. In response to crab predation cues, clams burrowed deeper, with longer siphons and greater siphon mass. Overall, crab predation removed clams with shorter siphons at shallow depths, and crab predation cues induced greater burrowing depths and longer siphons. Longer siphons and greater siphon mass of deeper clams suggests clams may allocate energy to siphon growth in response to crabs. By determining native behavior and morphological changes in response to an invasive predator, this study adds to our understanding of mechanisms for invasive impacts and illustrates the utility of measuring trait-mediated effects to investigate predator-prey dynamics.

AB The three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus is a model species for studying questions in ecology and evolution. The rapid diversification of G. aculeatus in post-glacial freshwater environments, combined with recently developed molecular tools, provides a unique opportunity to study the functional basis of fitness variation in natural populations. In derived freshwater populations, a number of morphological traits have diverged in parallel from the marine ancestral state, including the number of lateral armour plates. Evolution of reduced armour in freshwater populations is due to positive selection from both abiotic and biotic mechanisms. The major effect gene (ectodysplasin-A or Eda), along with several minor effect genetic regions, has recently been shown to control lateral plate variation. Field experiments have further determined the fitness consequences of allelic variation at the major effect locus. This work helps elucidate the mechanisms connecting genetic variation with phenotypic variation and fitness in the wild, a synthesis that should be applicable to many other phenotypic traits and species of fishes.

AB Samples of the foxfish Bodianus frenchii, collected over reefs on the lower west and south coasts of Western Australia, contained individuals ranging up to 78 years old. Although B. frenchii is far smaller than many other species within the Labridae, its maximum age is the greatest yet recorded for this highly speciose family and, together with Achoerodus gouldii, provides an example of a temperate hypsigenyine with exceptional longevity. Length and age compositions of females and males and the histological characteristics of gonads of a wide length range of individuals demonstrated that B. frenchii is a protogynous hermaphrodite. Furthermore, as, on both coasts, the length of the smallest male was greater than that at which all females had become mature, B. frenchii is a monandric protogynous hermaphrodite, i.e. all of its males are derived from functional females. Attainment of maturity by females is related more to length than age, whereas the reverse is true for sex change. On the basis of Schnute growth equations and length-to-body mass regression equations, the predicted length at age and body mass at length of fish on the south coast were greater than those on the west coast throughout life. Although B. frenchii spawns daily during the main spawning season, which extends from October to February on both coasts, its fecundity at any given length is substantially greater on the south than on the west coast. The more rapid growth of juveniles and earlier attainment of maturity by B. frenchii on the south coast than on the warmer west coast, together with maturation at a similar size on both coasts, run counter to the trends observed in many species and certain ecological theories regarding the relationships between life-cycle traits and latitude and temperature. The attainment by B. frenchii of a larger body length at age, of greater body mass at length and of greater fecundity at both length and body mass in fish on the south than on the west coast strongly suggests that conditions on the former, cooler coast are more favourable for this labrid, which belongs to a sub-genus whose other species typically live in cool, deep, temperate waters.

AB Biological invasions are a major threat to natural biodiversity; hence, understanding the mechanisms underlying invasibility (i.e., the susceptibility of a community to invasions by new species) is crucial. Invasibility of a resident community may be affected by a complex but hitherto hardly understood interplay of (1) productivity of the habitat, (2) diversity, (3) herbivory, and (4) the characteristics of both invasive and resident species. Using experimental phytoplankton microcosms, we investigated the effect of nutrient supply and species diversity on the invasibility of resident communities for two functionally different invaders in the presence or absence of an herbivore. With increasing nutrient supply, increased herbivore abundance indicated enhanced phytoplankton biomass production, and the invasion success of both invaders showed a unimodal pattern. At low nutrient supply (i.e., low influence of herbivory), the invasibility depended mainly on the competitive abilities of the invaders, whereas at high nutrient supply, the susceptibility to herbivory dominated. This resulted in different optimum nutrient levels for invasion success of the two species due to their individual functional traits. To test the effect of diversity on invasibility, a species richness gradient was generated by random selection from a resident species pool at an intermediate nutrient level. Invasibility was not affected by species richness; instead, it was driven by the functional traits of the resident and/or invasive species mediated by herbivore density. Overall, herbivory was the driving factor for invasibility of phytoplankton communities, which implies that other factors affecting the intensity of herbivory (e.g., productivity or edibility of primary producers) indirectly influence invasions.

AB Background: Denitrification is an important ecosystem service that removes nitrogen (N) from N-polluted watersheds, buffering soil, stream, and river water quality from excess N by returning N to the atmosphere before it reaches lakes or oceans and leads to eutrophication. The denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) assay is widely used for measuring denitrification potential. Because DEA is a function of enzyme levels in soils, most ecologists studying denitrification have assumed that DEA is less sensitive to ambient levels of nitrate (NO(3)(-)) and soil carbon and thus, less variable over time than field measurements. In addition, plant diversity has been shown to have strong effects on microbial communities and belowground processes and could potentially alter the functional capacity of denitrifiers. Here, we examined three questions: (1) Does DEA vary through the growing season? (2) If so, can we predict DEA variability with environmental variables? (3) Does plant functional diversity affect DEA variability?
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The study site is a restored wetland in North Carolina, US with native wetland herbs planted in monocultures or mixes of four or eight species. We found that denitrification potentials for soils collected in July 2006 were significantly greater than for soils collected in May and late August 2006 (p<0.0001). Similarly, microbial biomass standardized DEA rates were significantly greater in July than May and August (p<0.0001). Of the soil variables measured soil moisture, organic matter, total inorganic nitrogen, and microbial biomass-none consistently explained the pattern observed in DEA through time. There was no significant relationship between DEA and plant species richness or functional diversity. However, the seasonal variance in microbial biomass standardized DEA rates was significantly inversely related to plant species functional diversity (p<0.01).
   Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that higher plant functional diversity may support a more constant level of DEA through time, buffering the ecosystem from changes in season and soil conditions.

AB A procedure to select the most relevant metrics for assessing the ecological condition of the Douro basin (north Portugal) was developed based upon a set of 184 benthic community metrics. They were grouped into 16 biological categories selected from literature using data collected over 2 years from 54 sites along 31 rivers covering the whole perceived range of human disturbance. Multivariate analyses were carried out to identify the main trends in the macroinvertebrate data, to select reference versus impaired sites, to avoid multicolinearity between metrics, and to identify those that were clearly independent from natural stream typology. Structural metrics, adaptation metrics, and tolerance measures most effectively responded across a range of human influence. We find these attributes to be ecologically sound for monitoring Portugal's lotic ecosystems and providing information relevant to the Water Framework Directive, which asserts that the definition of water quality depends on its "ecological status", independent of the actual or potential uses of those waters.

AB P>1. We examined the accuracy of a multimetric approach based on 22 biological and ecological traits of benthic macroinvertebrate communities to assess toxic sediment pollution in streams.
   2. Faunal and chemical data from sites located on 150 medium-sized mountain streams in France were analysed. We used 18 additional sites, not included in the multimetric tool development as a test data set. A toxic quality class (from 'high' to 'poor/bad') was pre-assigned to each site using the French water quality assessment system (SEQ-Eau) based on toxic substances (metals, PAH and PCB) in sediment.
   3. Each trait was described in multiple categories. The affinity of macroinvertebrate taxa for the different categories of a trait was described using a fuzzy coding procedure. The relative abundance of trait categories was calculated for communities at each site.
   4. A nonparametric multiple comparison statistical procedure was used to compare relative abundances of trait categories between groups of sites assigned to different quality classes (e.g. high versus good; good versus moderate, etc.), to identify the combinations of trait categories that best separated sites between adjacent toxic quality classes. Based on such sets of trait categories, we propose a statistical procedure to allocate sites to toxic quality classes from the attributes of its benthic macroinvertebrate community.
   5. Predictions from the trait-based functional tool achieved approximately 73% of correct site post-assignments to toxic quality classes pre-assigned using chemical criteria. All of the sites pre-assigned to the 'high' quality class, were post-classified into the same quality class using benthic community attributes. From 0-90% of sites from other quality classes were classified identically using both chemistry- and trait-based criteria, the observed biological impact being often lower than expected. We suggest that the rapid decline of sensitive species could lead to both low taxonomic richness and low diversity of adaptations, giving communities a less diverse range of potential functional responses to increasing toxic pressure.
   6. Biological criteria based on macroinvertebrate traits could provide new methods for biological assessment. This study is the first step towards an in situ functional tool of stream sediment contamination assessment at community level. However, we need to increase the number of sites included in the development data set to improve the tool's precision, extend the procedure to additional stream types and validate the design at a larger spatial scale.

AB Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 possesses two putative ABC-type inorganic phosphate (P-i) transporters with three associated P-i-binding proteins (PBPs), SphX (encoded by sll0679), PstS1 (encoded by sll0680), and PstS2 (encoded by slr1247), organized in two spatially discrete gene clusters, pst1 and pst2. We used a combination of mutagenesis, gene expression, and radiotracer uptake analyses to functionally characterize the role of these PBPs and associated gene clusters. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated that pstS1 was expressed at a high level in P-i-replete conditions compared to sphX or pstS2. However, a P-i stress shift increased expression of pstS2 318-fold after 48 h, compared to 43-fold for pstS1 and 37-fold for sphX. A shift to high-light conditions caused a transient increase of all PBPs, whereas N stress primarily increased expression of sphX. Interposon mutagenesis of each PBP demonstrated that disruption of pstS1 alone caused constitutive expression of pho regulon genes, implicating PstS1 as a major component of the P-i sensing machinery. The pstS1 mutant was also transformation incompetent. P-32(i) radiotracer uptake experiments using pst1 and pst2 deletion mutants showed that Pst1 acts as a low-affinity, high-velocity transporter (K-s, 3.7 +/- 0.7 mu M; V-max, 31.18 +/- 3.96 fmol cell(-1) min(-1)) and Pst2 acts as a high-affinity, low-velocity system (K-s, 0.07 +/- 0.01 mu M; V-max, 0.88 +/- 0.11 fmol cell(-1) min(-1)). These P-i ABC transporters thus exhibit differences in both kinetic and regulatory properties, the former trait potentially dramatically increasing the dynamic range of P-i transport into the cell, which has potential implications for our understanding of the ecological success of this key microbial group.

AB P>1. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that plant traits play a crucial role in determining the success or failure of species in a given environment. However, whether traits play a role in determining species' abundance and rarity among the co-occurring species within a community remains an unresolved question.
   2. To address this, we analysed the abundance of California coastal woody plant species at landscape and local scales in relation to 11 leaf, wood and seed traits.
   3. At the landscape scale, we found no significant relationship between traits and abundance. In contrast, at the local scale we found significant relationships between abundance and four traits: specific leaf area (SLA), height, lumen fraction and wood density. For SLA and height, the relationship was linear; for lumen fraction, it was quadratic. For wood density, the direction of the trait-abundance relationship was dependant on the abiotic context, that is, it shifted across a gradient in soil water content.
   4.Synthesis. Understanding the connections between traits and abundance is important for two reasons. First, there is an ongoing debate about the degree to which commonness and rarity are the result of drift among ecologically equivalent species or niche processes. These results suggest that there are non-random, trait-based processes affecting abundance and rarity. Secondly, species' traits have been shown to have a strong effect on photosynthesis and decomposition rates, mediated by the abundance of the species. The connections between traits and abundance presented here are crucial for scaling from measurements of species' traits to ecosystem-level processes.

AB A mass-balance trophic model was built to describe the food-web traits of the North Aegean Sea (Strymonikos Gulf and Thracian Sea, Greece, Eastern Mediterranean) during the mid-2000s and to explore the impacts of fishing. This is the first food-web model representing the Aegean Sea, and results were presented and discussed in comparison to other previous ecosystems modelled from the western and the central areas of the basin (South Catalan and North-Central Adriatic Seas). Forty functional groups were defined, covering the entire trophic spectrum from lower to higher trophic levels. Emphasis was placed on commercial invertebrates and fish. The potential ecological role of the invasive ctenophore, Mnerniopsis leidyi, and several vulnerable groups (e.g., dolphins) was also explored. Results confirmed the spatial productivity patterns known for the Mediterranean Sea showing, for example, that the total biomass is highest in N.C. Adriatic and lowest in N. Aegean Sea. Accordingly, food-web flows and several ecosystem indicators like the mean transfer efficiency were influenced by these patterns. Nevertheless, all three systems shared some common features evidencing similarities of Mediterranean Sea ecosystems such as dominance of the pelagic fraction in terms of flows and strong benthic pelagic coupling of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates through detritus. The importance of detritus highlighted the role of the microbial food-web, which was indirectly considered through detritus dynamics. Ciliates, mesozooplankton and several benthic invertebrate groups were shown as important elements of the ecosystem linking primary producers and detritus with higher trophic levels in the N. Aegean Sea. Adult anchovy was shown as the most important fish group in terms of production, consumption and overall effect on the rest of the ecological groups in the model, in line with results from the Western Mediterranean Sea. The five fishing fleets considered (both artisanal and industrial) had high impacts on vulnerable species and numerous targeted groups given the multispecies nature of the fisheries in the N. Aegean Sea. Several exploitation indices highlighted that the N. Aegean Sea ecosystem was highly exploited and unlikely to be sustainably fished, similarly to other Mediterranean marine ecosystems.

AB Background: The European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a marine fish of great importance for fisheries and aquaculture. Functional genomics offers the possibility to discover the molecular mechanisms underlying productive traits in farmed fish, and a step towards the application of marker assisted selection methods in this species. To this end, we report here on the development of an oligo DNA microarray for D. labrax.
   Results: A database consisting of 19,048 unique transcripts was constructed, of which 12,008 (63%) could be annotated by similarity and 4,692 received a GO functional annotation. Two non-overlapping 60mer probes were designed for each unique transcript and in-situ synthesized on glass slides using Agilent SurePrint (TM) technology. Probe design was positively completed for 19,035 target clusters; the oligo microarray was then applied to profile gene expression in mandibles and whole-heads of fish affected by prognathism, a skeletal malformation that strongly affects sea bass production. Statistical analysis identified 242 transcripts that are significantly down-regulated in deformed individuals compared to normal fish, with a significant enrichment in genes related to nervous system development and functioning. A set of genes spanning a wide dynamic range in gene expression level were selected for quantitative RT-PCR validation. Fold change correlation between microarray and qPCR data was always significant.
   Conclusions: The microarray platform developed for the European sea bass has a high level of flexibility, reliability, and reproducibility. Despite the well known limitations in achieving a proper functional annotation in non-model species, sufficient information was obtained to identify biological processes that are significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes. New insights were obtained on putative mechanisms involved on mandibular prognathism, suggesting that bone/nervous system development might play a role in this phenomenon.

AB The individual functional traits of different species play a key role for ecosystem function in aquatic and terrestrial systems. We modeled a multispecies predator-prey system with functionally different predator and prey species based on observations of the community dynamics of ciliates and their algal prey in Lake Constance. The model accounted for differences in predator feeding preferences and prey susceptibility to predation, and for the respective trade-offs. A low food demand of the predator was connected to a high food selectivity, and a high growth rate of the prey was connected to a high vulnerability to grazing. The data and the model did not show standard uniform predator-prey cycles, but revealed both complex dynamics and a coexistence of predator and prey at high biomass levels. These dynamics resulted from internally driven alternations in species densities and involved compensatory dynamics between functionally different species. Functional diversity allowed for ongoing adaptation of the predator and prey communities to changing environmental conditions such as food composition and grazing pressure. The trade-offs determined whether compensatory or synchronous dynamics occurred which influence the variability at the community level. Compensatory dynamics were promoted by a joint carrying capacity linking the different prey species which is particularly relevant at high prey biomasses, i.e., when grazers are less efficient. In contrast, synchronization was enhanced by the coupling of the different predator and prey species via common feeding links, e.g., by a high grazing pressure of a nonselective predator. The communities had to be functionally diverse in terms of their trade-offs and their traits to yield compensatory dynamics. Rather similar predator species tended to cycle synchronously, whereas profoundly different species did not coexist. Compensatory dynamics at the community level thus required intermediately strong tradeoffs for functional traits in both predators and their prey.

AB P>1. Our objective was to investigate the associations between benthic macro-invertebrate communities and environmental factors described at three spatial scales: local, reach and catchment. Differences in these associations, because of local topography, were determined by categorising sites into those having a large or small 'reach contributing area' (RCA), which is the lateral area of land contributing surface and subsurface flow of water, nutrients, organic and inorganic materials to a stream reach independent of catchment size and upstream contributions, and created by local topography.
   2. Twenty-three sites were sampled in the Lake Nipigon Forest in north-western Ontario. Local variables included hydrological metrics and stream morphology characteristics. Terrestrial reach and catchment variables included forest characteristics, topography and geomorphology. Invertebrates were identified and classified into functional feeding guilds. Canonical correspondence analysis and redundancy analysis were used to determine which variables contributed most to macro-invertebrate community structure and how the RCA influenced those associations.
   3. Overall, local-scale variables explained most variation in taxonomic and functional community structure (51.6 and 59.1%). Catchment-scale variables explained more variation in the community (43.9 and 43.5%) than reach-scale variables. In sites with a large RCA, the reach-scale variables accounted for almost 10% more variability in taxonomic structure than the catchment-scale variables, and in sites with a small RCA, catchment-scale variables explained almost 23% more variation in feeding guild structure than reach-scale variables.
   4. Topography was important at both the reach and the catchment scales. Variables at the reach scale most associated with invertebrate community tended to be related to forest cover, whereas important variables at the catchment scale were related to topography, wetlands and lakes.
   5. The difference in associations between invertebrate communities and environmental factors based on RCA indicates the influence of local topography on the linkage between aquatic habitats and the surrounding terrestrial environment. Understanding how these linkages affect aquatic communities can help to develop more effective predictive models of invertebrate community and more prescriptive conservation and management strategies for small streams.

AB Filter-feeding mussels historically comprised most of benthic biomass in many streams. They contribute to stream ecosystem functioning by linking the water column and benthic habitats. Both native and nonnative species coexist in many streams, but their ecological roles are not well quantified. The invasive bivalve, Corbicula fluminea, has the potential to alter profoundly organic matter dynamics and nutrient cycling in streams. We compared stable isotope ratios and tissue and biodeposit stoichiometry of the native freshwater mussel, Elliptio crassidens, and C. fluminea in a Coastal Plain stream (Ichawaynochaway Creek, a tributary to the lower Flint River, Georgia, USA) to assess their trophic niche space and potential effects on nutrient cycling. We hypothesized that C. fluminea would assimilate a larger range of materials than E. crassidens. To determine dietary overlap of C. fltuninea and E. crassidens, we measured the elemental and stable isotopic compositions (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) of their tissue. Corbicula fluminea showed lower trophic fidelity than E. crassidens and was able to acquire and assimilate a wide range of resources, as illustrated by their wide range of delta(13)C values. Corbicula fluminea also might alter nutrient cycling in the benthic environment of streams because they retain less N than E. crassidens, as reflected by their higher tissue C:N. In the laboratory, we measured C and N in biodeposits (feces and pseudofeces) from the 2 species. Corbicula fluminea released more N through their biodeposits relative to E. crassidens by mass, a result implying that C. flurninen might modify nutrient cycling in streams. Our results show important differences in the food resources assimilated and the nutrients deposited as feces and pseudofeces by these 2 bivalves. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how invasive species, such as C. fluminea, can alter aquatic environments through differences in species traits within a functional group.

AB Background: The presence of Bacillus in very diverse environments reflects the versatile metabolic capabilities of a widely distributed genus. Traditional phylogenetic analysis based on limited gene sampling is not adequate for resolving the genus evolutionary relationships. By distinguishing between core and pan-genome, we determined the evolutionary and functional relationships of known Bacillus.
   Results: Our analysis is based upon twenty complete and draft Bacillus genomes, including a newly sequenced Bacillus isolate from an aquatic environment that we report for the first time here. Using a core genome, we were able to determine the phylogeny of known Bacilli, including aquatic strains whose position in the phylogenetic tree could not be unambiguously determined in the past. Using the pan-genome from the sequenced Bacillus, we identified functional differences, such as carbohydrate utilization and genes involved in signal transduction, which distinguished the taxonomic groups. We also assessed the genetic architecture of the defining traits of Bacillus, such as sporulation and competence, and showed that less than one third of the B. subtilis genes are conserved across other Bacilli. Most variation was shown to occur in genes that are needed to respond to environmental cues, suggesting that Bacilli have genetically specialized to allow for the occupation of diverse habitats and niches.
   Conclusions: The aquatic Bacilli are defined here for the first time as a group through the phylogenetic analysis of 814 genes that comprise the core genome. Our data distinguished between genomic components, especially core vs. pan-genome to provide insight into phylogeny and function that would otherwise be difficult to achieve. A phylogeny may mask the diversity of functions, which we tried to uncover in our approach. The diversity of sporulation and competence genes across the Bacilli was unexpected based on previous studies of the B. subtilis model alone. The challenge of uncovering the novelties and variations among genes of the non-subtilis groups still remains. This task will be best accomplished by directing efforts toward understanding phylogenetic groups with similar ecological niches.

AB Herbicides affect the structure and functional parameters of fluvial biofilm. Diuron is toxic to primary producers and disrupts endocrine activity. Here, we studied the interaction between this toxicant and several biological compartments in a simple food chain composed of herbivores (the snail Physella [Costatella] acuta) and biofilm. We used indoor experimental channels to which Diuron was added at a realistic concentration (2 mu g/L). Bacterial survival and chlorophyll-a and photosynthetic activity were analyzed in the biofilm. We monitored biomass, mortality, reproduction, and motility as end points in the freshwater snail P. acuta. Our results showed that bacterial survival and photosynthetic activity were sensitive to Diuron. Snails were not affected by the herbicide at the concentration tested. No significant interactions between the toxicant and grazers were observed on the biofilm. Reproductive traits, however, were slightly affected, indicating a possible endocrine disruption.

AB The link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is an important question that remains unresolved, particularly in marine systems, in which cycling of organic matter by benthic organisms is of global significance. Direct observations of specific resource use by each species in single- and multispecies communities, as quantified by stable isotopes, facilitates a mechanistic understanding of the importance of each species for ecosystem functioning. We tested the effects of altered biodiversity (species richness) of deposit-feeding macrofauna on incorporation and burial of phytodetritus in combinations of three species representing natural communities found in the sediments of the species-poor Baltic Sea. The three species, two amphipods and a bivalve, had different rates of incorporation and burial and different needs for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The amphipods exhibited clear resource partitioning in sympatry, as a result of vertical separation in the sediment and consequent differential use of food. Communities of several species incorporated more C and N than expected from the respective single-species treatments, due to higher incorporation by surface feeders in multispecies treatments. Community incorporation of N in the most diverse treatment even exceeded N incorporation by a single-species treatment of the best-performing species, showing transgressive over-yielding. This over-yielding was primarily due to positive complementarity in all treatments. Diverse soft bottoms are also likely to be more productive in the long run, as species-specific traits (subsurface feeding) preserve fresh phytodetritus by burying it to depths in the sediment at which the mineralization rate is low. The more diverse sediment communities showed more efficient trophic transfer of phytodetritus, a finding of general significance for understanding biological processes driving the transformation of nutrients and energy in benthic ecosystems.

DT Article
DE Aquatic macrophytes; Risk assessment; Tools; Guidance; Chemicals
AB Primary producers play critical structural and functional roles in aquatic ecosystems; therefore, it is imperative that the potential risks of toxicants to aquatic plants are adequately assessed in the risk assessment of chemicals. The standard required macrophyte test species is the floating (non-sediment-rooted) duckweed Lemna spp. This macrophyte species might not be representative of all floating, rooted, emergent, and submerged macrophyte species because of differences in the duration and mode of exposure; sensitivity to the specific toxic mode of action of the chemical; and species-specific traits (e.g., duckweed's very short generation time).
   These topics were addressed during the workshop entitled "Aquatic Macrophyte Risk Assessment for Pesticides" (AMRAP) where a risk assessment scheme for aquatic macrophytes was proposed. Four working groups evolved from this workshop and were charged with the task of developing Tier 1 and higher-tier aquatic macrophyte risk assessment procedures. Subsequently, a SETAC Advisory Group, the Macrophyte Ecotoxicology Group (AMEG) was formed as an umbrella organization for various macrophyte working groups. The purpose of AMEG is to provide scientifically based guidance in all aspects of aquatic macrophyte testing in the laboratory and field, including prospective as well as retrospective risk assessments for chemicals. As AMEG expands, it will begin to address new topics including bioremediation and sustainable management of aquatic macrophytes in the context of ecosystem services.

AB 1. The structure of biological communities reflects the influence of both local environmental conditions and processes such as dispersal that create patterns in species' distribution across a region.
   2. We extend explicit tests of the relative importance of local environmental conditions and regional spatial processes to aquatic plants, a group traditionally thought to be little limited by dispersal. We used partial canonical correspondence analysis and partial Mantel tests to analyse data from 98 lakes and ponds across Connecticut (northeastern United States).
   3. We found that aquatic plant community structure reflects the influence of local conditions (pH, conductivity, water clarity, lake area, maximum depth) as well as regional processes.
   4. Only 27% of variation in a presence/absence matrix was explained by environmental conditions and spatial processes such as dispersal. Of the total explained, 45% was related to environmental conditions and 40% to spatial processes.
   5. Jaccard similarity declined with Euclidean distance between lakes, even after accounting for the increasing difference in environmental conditions, suggesting that dispersal limitation may influence community composition in the region.
   6. The distribution of distances among lakes where species occurred was associated with dispersal-related functional traits, providing additional evidence that dispersal ability varies among species in ways that affect community composition.
   7. Although environmental and spatial variables explained a significant amount of variation in community structure, a substantial amount of stochasticity also affects these communities, probably associated with unpredictable colonisation and persistence of the plants.

AB P>1. Plant functional traits are dimensions of ecological strategy variation and provide insights into the assembly of plant communities. For woody rain forest vegetation of northern coastal New South Wales, Australia, we quantified four continuous traits (leaf size, seed size, wood density and maximum height) for 231 freestanding woody species and documented community composition for 216 plots. Using trait-gradient analysis, we partitioned species trait values between alpha (within-site) and beta (among-site) components. This allowed us to identify both trait shifts along gradients and variation among co-occurring species.
   2. Alpha trait components consistently varied more widely than beta components, meaning that trait variation among species within plots was wider than variation in the mean trait values of plots where species typically grow.
   3. Beta trait components covaried significantly among leaf area, seed size, wood density and maximum height. For example, species found in habitats with a large mean leaf size were consistently also found in plots with large mean seed size (r = 0.70). Beta correlations show that these leaf, wood and seed traits respond in parallel to the dominant abiotic gradients: soil types, topographic position, elevation and large-patch disturbances such as those caused by cyclones-storms, landslips or fires.
   4. In contrast, the alpha components of traits were largely uncorrelated among species. Alpha leaf area was not associated with alpha larger seeds, meaning that leaf area and seed size act as independent axes of differentiation among coexisting species.
   5. Synthesis. The different correlation structures for alpha and beta components of traits reflect community assembly processes at different scales. Within sites, assembly processes have not created strong linkages among these traits. But across different sites in the landscape, abiotic drivers have created strong linkages.

AB Climate change will alter concurrently many environmental factors that exert control over oceanic phytoplankton. Recent laboratory culture work, shipboard experiments, and field surveys reveal many remaining unknowns about the bottom-up controls for five globally important algal groups. Increasing uncertainties exist, respectively, for picocyanobacteria, diatoms, Phaeocystis spp., N-2-fixing cyanobacteria, and coccolithophores. This missing information about current environmental controls will hinder progress in modeling how these phytoplankton will be influenced by climate change. A review of conceptual approaches used to elucidate the relationship between environmental controls and phytoplankton dominance, from Margalef's mandala to functional traits, uncovered limitations regarding their application to climate-change scenarios. For example, these previous approaches have insufficient scope or dimensions to take into account the confounding effects of synergistic and antagonistic interactions of multiple environmental change variables. A new approach is needed that considers all of the different environmental properties altered by climate change and their interactions while at the same time permitting a subset of the most significant controls for a specific phytoplankton group to be isolated and evaluated in factorial matrix perturbation experiments. We advocate three new interlinked approaches, including environmental clusters that incorporate all factors (temperature, CO2, light, nutrients, and trace metals), which both exert control over present-day floristics and will be altered by climate change. By carefully linking a holistic conceptual approach to a reductionist experimental design, the future responses of open-ocean phytoplankton groups to a complex, rapidly changing environment can be better predicted.

AB In forested wetlands, hydrology exerts complex and sometimes compensatory influences on tree growth. This is particularly true in semi-arid ecosystems, where water can be both a limiting resource and a stressor. To better understand these relationships, we studied hydrologic and edaphic controls on the density, growth, tree architecture and overall productivity of forested wetlands dominated by the tree species Alnus glutinosa and Salix atrocinerea in Southern Europe. We sampled 49 plots set within 21 stands in the Atlantic coastal zone of the Iberian Peninsula, and quantified woody composition, size structure (diameter and height), and radial growth using dendrochronology. Plots were grouped into three saturation classes to compare tree growth characteristics (tree density, degree of sprouting, live basal area and productivity) across levels of saturation. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to create integrated explanatory factors of hydrology, soil nutrient status and soil texture for use in linear mixed models to predict stand characteristics. Increased site saturation favoured a shift in species dominance from Alnus to Salix and resulted in a higher degree of multi-stemmed tree architecture ('shrubbiness'), particularly for Alnus. Radial growth was negatively correlated with long-term soil saturation; however, annual productivity on a per-tree basis varied by species. Alnus growth and tree density were negatively correlated with waterlogging and fine-textured soils, possibly due to anaerobiosis in the rooting zone. In contrast, Salix growth was more influenced by nutrient limitation. Overall site productivity as measured by annual basal area increment decreased with prolonged saturation. In summary, soil saturation appears to act as a chronic stressor for tree species in this ecosystem. However, these species persist and maintain a dominant canopy position in the most permanently flooded patches through increased sprouting, albeit at a reduced rate of overall biomass accumulation relative to well-drained sites. The diversity in functional responses among wetland forest species has important implications for the conservation and management of these ecosystems. The sustainable management of these ecosystems is directly tied to their vulnerability to changing hydrological conditions.

AB Daphnia are an important and widely studied model species in ecological and toxicological studies throughout the world and an official (OECD) recommended test organism. Their small size, wide distribution and easy growth conditions make this organism ideal for functional genomics based studies, including metabolic profiling and transcriptomics. In this study we used an integrated systems approach in which transcriptomic, metabolomic and energetic responses of juvenile (4 days old) daphnids were evaluated in response to exposure to two poly aromatic hydrocarbons (pyrene and fluoranthene) and binary mixtures thereof. In addition, these responses were linked to responses measured during chronic experiments (21 days) assessing survival, growth and reproductive traits. Custom Daphnia magna microarrays were used to assess transcriptomic changes. Hierarchical cluster analysis did not result in a clear distinction between the single compounds suggesting similar molecular modes of action. Cluster analysis with both the single compounds and the binary mixture treatments resulted in a separation of treatments based on differences in toxic ratios rather than component differences. Changes in the metabolic profiles of the organisms were investigated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Gas and Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. These multivariate metabolomic datasets were analyzed with Principal Components Analysis and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis. The major metabolite changes responsible for the differences observed indicated a disturbance in aminosugar metabolism in all cases. The study demonstrates the potential of 'omics' to provide screening tools for monitoring of the freshwater environment in invertebrate species which is reasonably rapid, cost effective and has the potential to greatly increase the amount of information obtained from aquatic toxicology testing.

AB P>1. Positive interactions driven by ecosystem engineers have been determined to be important community forces in stressed environments. By ameliorating habitat conditions, ecosystem engineering can create available ecological niches for other species. In poorly oxygenated sediments of freshwater wetlands, small invertebrates such as tubificid worms and chironomid larvae are known to function as active bioturbators; however, their effects on the growth and physiology of organisms which are constrained by low oxygenation of sediments have never been studied.
   2. We examined whether the common bioturbator, Tubifex tubifex, significantly influences the growth and the physiological state of two plant species, Elodea canadensis and Myriophyllum spicatum, in experimental systems simulating a water-sediment interface of wetlands. We also quantified the influence of plant-animal interactions on biogeochemical processes (fluxes of oxygen and nitrogen at the water-sediment interface) and microbial compartment in sediments.
   3. Tubificid worms stimulated growth of aboveground and belowground biomasses of the two plants through reduction in the anoxic stress in sediments. Myriophyllum spicatum, which was the best adapted to sedimentary anaerobic conditions, essentially increased its biomass whereas E. canadensis, less adapted to anaerobic conditions, shifted its root metabolism from anaerobic to aerobic.
   4. Biogeochemical processes were not significantly influenced by plant-animal interactions: (i) oxygen flux from overlying water to sediments probably reached a threshold that could not be raised by the increased plant biomass induced by worms and (ii) nitrogen fluxes were essentially linked to bioturbation activities of worms.
   5. Our study confirmed that the reduction in constraining variables by physical habitat modifications (ecosystem engineering) may play a crucial role in community and ecosystem processes. The fact that positive interactions measured between ecosystem engineers and plant species in anoxic wetland sediments were highly dependent on the ecophysiology of plant species suggests an extension of this first study to a wide range of macrophytes in order to determine the main plant functional traits driving plant-animal interactions in wetland sediments.

AB Accurately predicting terrestrial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage requires understanding how plant invasions alter cycling and storage. A common, highly successful type of plant invasion occurs when the invasive species is of a distinctly different functional type than the native dominant plant, such as shrub encroachment throughout the western United States and annual grass invasions in Mediterranean shrublands, as studied here. Such invasions can dramatically transform landscapes and have large potential to alter C and N cycling by influencing storage in multiple pools. We used a manipulation of non-native annual grass litter within a shrub-dominated habitat in southern California (coastal sage scrub, CSS) to study how grass invasion alters ecosystem C and N storage. We added, removed, or left unchanged grass litter in areas of high and low invasion, then followed soil and vegetation changes. Grass litter greatly increased C and N storage in soil, aboveground native and non-native biomass. Aboveground litter storage increased due to the greater inputs and slower decomposition of grass litter relative to shrub litter; shading by grass litter further reduced decomposition of both non-native and native litter, which may be due to reduced photodegradation. Soil C and N pools in areas of high litter increased similar to 20% relative to low litter areas in the two years following manipulation and were generally sinks for C and N, while areas with low litter were sources. We synthesize our results into a C cycle of invaded and uninvaded areas of CSS and link changes in storage to increases in the soil fungi : bacteria ratio, increased plant inputs, and decreased litter loss. Overall, we show that grasses, especially through their litter, control important abiotic and biotic mechanisms governing C and N storage, with widespread implications for C sequestration and N storage in semiarid systems undergoing grass or shrub invasions.

AB The persistence of tropical coral reefs is threatened by rapidly increasing climate warming, causing a functional breakdown of the obligate symbiosis between corals and their algal photosymbionts (Symbiodinium) through a process known as coral bleaching. Yet the potential of the coral-algal symbiosis to genetically adapt in an evolutionary sense to warming oceans is unknown. Using a quantitative genetics approach, we estimated the proportion of the variance in thermal tolerance traits that has a genetic basis (i.e. heritability) as a proxy for their adaptive potential in the widespread Indo-Pacific reef-building coral Acropora millepora. We chose two physiologically different populations that associate respectively with one thermo-tolerant (Symbiodinium clade D) and one less tolerant symbiont type (Symbiodinium C2). In both symbiont types, pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed significant heritabilities for traits related to both photosynthesis and photoprotective pigment profile. However, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays showed a lack of heritability in both coral host populations for their own expression of fundamental stress genes. Coral colony growth, contributed to by both symbiotic partners, displayed heritability. High heritabilities for functional key traits of algal symbionts, along with their short clonal generation time and high population sizes allow for their rapid thermal adaptation. However, the low overall heritability of coral host traits, along with the corals' long generation time, raise concern about the timely adaptation of the coral-algal symbiosis in the face of continued rapid climate warming.

AB The largest perturbation on upper trophic levels of many marine ecosystems stems from fishing. The reaction of the ecosystem goes beyond the trophic levels directly targeted by the fishery. This reaction has been described either as a change in slope of the overall size spectrum or as a trophic cascade triggered by the removal of top predators. Here we use a novel size- and trait-based model to explore how marine ecosystems might react to perturbations from different types of fishing pressure. The model explicitly resolves the whole life history of fish, from larvae to adults. The results show that fishing does not change the overall slope of the size spectrum, but depletes the largest individuals and induces trophic cascades. A trophic cascade can propagate both up and down in trophic levels driven by a combination of changes in predation mortality and food limitation. The cascade is damped as it comes further away from the perturbed trophic level. Fishing on several trophic levels leads to a disappearance of the signature of the trophic cascade. Differences in fishing patterns among ecosystems might influence whether a trophic cascade is observed.

AB Semiarid saline streams are rare aquatic ecosystem types. Their constituent biota is expected to have adapted evolutionarily to strong hydrological variability and salinity stress; however, their ecology is not well known. In this study, we quantify the seasonal changes in the structure of the macroinvertebrate community in the Reventn Rambla (south-eastern Spain), a permanent saline spring stream which is included in a drainage system consisting of ephemeral dry channels (so-called "ramblas"). Seasonal patterns of community structure were studied in two reaches with contrasting environmental regimes using univariate and multivariate statistics. The upstream site showed more stable environmental conditions than the downstream site, and both sites also differed with regard to species richness, and structural and functional group attributes. On a seasonal basis, community dissimilarity was high during periods when both sites were isolated during summer droughts but dissimilarity decreased when both sites were connected through surface flow. Furthermore, the communities tended to show cyclical trajectories in multivariate ordination space. Rather than being related to salinity stress, these patterns seemed to track the hydrological disturbance regime of this rambla system. Spates tended to disrupt communities, while signs of recovery were evident during low-flow periods. Results suggest that salinity fluctuation does not pose a severe abiotic constraint to these adapted macroinvertebrate communities. Their suits of functional properties provide them with the necessary traits to recover quickly from natural disturbance. While human-caused salinization of streams severely impacts communities eventually reducing their recovery potential, our results suggest that communities in natural saline streams may show similar responses to hydrological disturbance as communities from non-saline streams.

AB 1. A fundamental trade-off among vascular plants between traits inferring rapid resource acquisition and those leading to conservation of resources has now been accepted broadly, but is based on empirical data with a strong bias towards leaf traits. Here, we test whether interspecific variation in traits of different plant organs obeys this same trade-off and whether within-plant trade-offs are consistent between organs.
   2. Thereto, we measured suites of the same chemical and structural traits from the main vegetative organs for a species set representing aquatic, riparian and terrestrial environments including the main vascular higher taxa and growth forms of a subarctic flora. The traits were chosen to have consistent relevance for plant defence and growth across organs and environments: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, lignin, dry matter content, pH.
   3. Our analysis shows several new trait correlations across leaves, stems and roots and a striking pattern of whole-plant integrative resource economy, leading to tight correspondence between the local leaf economics spectrum and the root (r = 0.64), stem (r = 0.78) and whole-plant (r = 0.93) economics spectra.
   4. Synthesis. Our findings strongly suggest that plant resource economics is consistent across species' organs in a subarctic flora. We provide thus the first evidence for a 'plant economics spectrum' closely related to the local subarctic 'leaf economics spectrum'. Extending that concept to other biomes is, however, necessary before any generalization might be made. In a world facing rapid vegetation change, these results nevertheless bear considerable prospects of predicting below-ground plant functions from the above-ground components alone.

AB Life-history research has a long tradition in benthic biology because of its value in explaining patterns observed in nature, quantifying trophic relationships and energetics, and interpreting experimental results. We examined articles published in the Journal of the North American Benthological Society (J-NABS) during a 23-y period (volumes 5-27) to determine trends in life-history research and to assess future needs in these types of studies. Of the 9 life-history elements we examined, growth and mortality of benthic macroinvertebrates were most commonly reported in the 412 J-NABS Studies containing >= 1 of these elements Recruitment and dormancy were the least-studied elements, and development, reproduction, dispersal, voltinism, and phenology were intermediate. Most Of these Studies were based on aquatic insects, especially Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera, and mollusks (particularly bivalves). Detailed life histories of single species published in J-NABS have averaged similar to 1/volume, With most Studies being on Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata. Both detailed life-history Studies and Studies containing life-history elements have declined over time, especially when considered as a percentage of articles published in J-NABS In a timeline of important developments in life-history studies, 4 time periods or themes were evident 1) an emphasis on descriptive natural history, which was the earliest type of ecological research conducted and which extended into the 1970s, 2) synthesis of life-history information in books and review articles, which was most prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s, 3) adoption Of functional-feeding groups as a measure Of trophic Status of benthic organisms, which began in the 1970s and continues through today, and 4) the use of a species-trait approach to examine both basic and applied aspects of benthic biology, which began in the 1990s, is an expanding research area, and is a valuable application of life-history information. Life-history research has been published more often in specialized proceedings and regional journals than in J-NABS Clearly more life-history research is needed, but time, logistical considerations, and funding constraints restrict professional benthologists from conducting this kind of research Perhaps anglers and those participating in volunteer monitoring groups can be encouraged to conduct Studies to provide this needed information

AB Effective ecosystem management in the face of human alterations depends on our ability to quantify ecologically significant changes and to discriminate among impact levels and types We reviewed the literature on biological responses of freshwater biota to human disturbances over the last century. Many of the main methods for assessing ecological integrity originated in Europe [e g, Saprobien Index, Trent Biotic Index, Biological Monitoring Working Party, River InVertebrate Prediction And Classification System, multiple traits] or in North America [e.g., Index of Biotic Integrity, leaf-litter breakdown, functional feeding groups] We used bibliometric data to detail the contribution of J-NABS to developments in assessment of ecological integrity. A total of 225 bioassessment articles were published in J-NABS from 1986 to 2007 This total was similar to 1/2 of the number of bioassessment articles published over the same period in Freshwater Biology (FWB, another leading freshwater journal used for comparison), but the proportion of bioassessment articles in the 2 journals was similar (similar to 20%). The proportion of bioassessment articles in J-NABS has increased over the last 25 y. This trend indicates the growing interest in the topic and the delay (similar to 30 y since the Clean Water Act) of scientific action in response to water legislation Taxonomic composition and multivariate techniques, multimetric indices, lotic systems, macroinvertebrates, land use, and overall human impacts were major themes in J-NABS bioassessment articles. Progress in bioassessment is needed in 3 main areas First, bioassessments done at large spatial scales are needed to meet requirements of new environmental policies Second, bioassessment should shift from consideration of taxon losses to losses of ecological functions Third, statistical techniques are needed for predictive assessment of deviation in ecological integrity between expected (natural) and observed (natural or impacted) conditions. Assessment of functional integrity based on multiple traits is a promising area because biological traits represent universal biological characteristics that are connected to ecosystem functions However, the relationships between ecophysiological traits of individuals and ecosystem-scale responses must be properly defined for specific types of human impairment, and utility of the approach for routine bioassessments applied by managers must be tested.

AB Pinus palustris Mill. (longleaf pine, LL) and Pinus elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii (slash pine, SL) frequently co-occur in lower coastal plain flatwoods of the USA, with LL typically inhabiting slightly higher and better-drained microsites than SL. The hydraulic architecture and tracheid dimensions of roots, trunk and branches of mature LL and SL trees were compared to understand their role in species microsite occupation. Root xylem had higher sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity (k(s)) and was less resistant to cavitation compared with branches and trunk sapwood. Root k(s) of LL was significantly higher than SL, whereas branch and trunk k(s) did not differ between species. No differences in vulnerability to cavitation were observed in any of the organs between species. Across all organs, there was a significant but weak trade-off between water conduction efficiency and safety. Tracheid hydraulic diameter (D(h)) was strongly correlated with k(s) across all organs, explaining > 73% of the variation in k(s). In contrast, tracheid length (L(t)) explained only 2.4% of the variability. Nevertheless, for trunk xylem, k(s) was 39.5% higher at 20 m compared with 1.8 m; this increase in k(s) was uncorrelated with D(h) and cell-wall thickness but was strongly correlated with the difference in L(t). Tracheid allometry markedly changed between sapwood of roots, trunks and branches, possibly reflecting different mechanical constraints. Even though vulnerability to cavitation was not different for sapwood of roots, branches or the trunks of LL and SL, higher sapwood to leaf area ratio and higher maximum sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity in roots of LL are functional traits that may provide LL with a competitive advantage on drier soil microsites.

AB Modern fisheries research and management must understand and take account of the interactions between climate and fishing, rather than try to disentangle their effects and address each separately. These interactions are significant drivers of change in exploited marine systems and have ramifications for ecosystems and those who depend on the services they provide. We discuss how fishing and climate forcing interact on individual fish, marine populations, marine communities, and ecosystems to bring these levels into states that are more sensitive to (i.e. more strongly related with) climate forcing. Fishing is unlikely to alter the sensitivities of individual finfish and invertebrates to climate forcing. It will remove individuals with specific characteristics from the gene pool, thereby affecting structure and function at higher levels of organisation. Fishing leads to a loss of older age classes, spatial contraction, loss of sub-units, and alteration of life history traits in populations, making them more sensitive to climate variability at interannual to interdecadal scales. Fishing reduces the mean size of individuals and mean trophic level of communities, decreasing their turnover time leading them to track environmental variability more closely. Marine ecosystems under intense exploitation evolve towards stronger bottom-up control and greater sensitivity to climate forcing. Because climate change occurs slowly, its effects are not likely to have immediate impacts on marine systems but will be manifest as the accumulation of the interactions between fishing and climate variability - unless threshold limits are exceeded. Marine resource managers need to develop approaches which maintain the resilience of individuals, populations, communities and ecosystems to the combined and interacting effects of climate and fishing. Overall, a less-heavily fished marine system, and one which shifts the focus from individual species to functional groups and fish communities, is likely to provide more stable catches with climate variability and change than would a heavily fished system.

AB Question: Although the restinga vegetation lies adjacent to the species-rich Atlantic Rainforest, fewer species thrive due to low available resources of the sandy substrate. We asked whether there is a specific set of functional traits related to the ability to attain high dominance in a restinga dominated by a CAM photosynthesis tree.
   Location: Restinga of Jurubatiba National Park, north of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Methods: We chose traits that are commonly used in large screenings, leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf longevity (LL) and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC). We also measured the functional traits, midday leaf water potential (Psi(min)), pressure-volume curves, nitrogen isotope discrimination (delta N-15) and chlorophyll fluorescence. We compared species using ANOVA and ordination analysis.
   Results: The two most dominant species differed from subordinate species in terms of leaf succulence (SUC) and Psi(min). However, they were also significantly different from each other in LMA, SUC, leaf thickness and LNC. Psi(min) and delta N-15 had the strongest loadings on the third ordination axis, which, despite explaining only 18.2% of total variance, was the only axis reflecting variation in species dominance.
   Conclusions: Despite high interspecific variation, the most common traits of the leaf economic spectrum were not directly associated with variation in species dominance. In contrast, the bulk modulus of elasticity, Psi(min) and delta N-15 were important not only to track the connection between plant traits and environmental factors, but also between plant traits and community structure.

AB Questions: To what extent do plant species traits, including life history, life form, and disturbance response characteristics, affect the degree to which species distributions are determined by physical environmental factors? Is the strength of the relationship between species distribution and environment stronger in some disturbance-response types than in others?
   Location: California southwest ecoregion, USA.
   Methods: We developed species distribution models (SDMs) for 45 plant species using three primary modeling methods (GLMs, GAMs, and Random Forests). Using AUC as a performance measure of prediction accuracy, and measure of the strength of species-environment correlations, we used regression analyses to compare the effects of fire disturbance response type, longevity, dispersal mechanism, range size, cover, species prevalence, and model type.
   Results: Fire disturbance response type explained more variation in model performance than any other variable, but other species and range characteristics were also significant. Differences in prediction accuracy reflected variation in species life history, disturbance response, and rarity. AUC was significantly higher for longer-lived species, found at intermediate levels of abundance, and smaller range sizes. Models performed better for shrubs than sub-shrubs and perennial herbs. The disturbance response type with the highest SDM accuracy was obligate-seeding shrubs with ballistic dispersal that regenerate via fire-cued germination from a dormant seed bank.
   Conclusions: The effect of species characteristics on predictability of species distributions overrides any differences in modeling technique. Prediction accuracy may be related to how a suite of species characteristics co-varies along environmental gradients. Including disturbance response was important because SDMs predict the realized niche. Classification of plant species into disturbance response types may provide a strong framework for evaluating performance of SDMs.

AB Whole-animal performance abilities can facilitate the avoidance of predation and consequently influence fitness, but determining the functional significance of antipredation tactics is difficult without understanding how alternate predator escape strategies are related. We measured maximal sprint speed and dive duration in the semi-aquatic skink Oligosoma suteri to determine how morphology and behaviour influence these alternate predator escape techniques and the relationship between the two measures. Gravid females and juveniles ran significantly slower, but had equivalent or longer dive durations than males and nongravid females. The two performance measures were not influenced by the same morphological and behavioural traits, and were not correlated among individuals. Thus, individuals that are poor sprinters because of their state (e.g. gravid or tail-less individuals) would have a greater likelihood of successful escape by adopting an alternate escape strategy. For species that use multiple strategies for the same function, quantifying selection on whole-animal performance will be difficult.

AB The use of structural equation modeling (SEM) is often motivated by its utility for investigating complex networks of relationships, but also because of its promise as a means of representing theoretical Concepts using latent variables. In this paper, we discuss characteristics of ecological theory and some of the challenges for proper specification of theoretical ideas in structural equation models (SE models). In our presentation, we describe some of the requirements for classical latent variable models in which observed variables (indicators) are interpreted as the effects of underlying causes. We also describe alternative model specifications in which indicators are interpreted as having causal influences on the theoretical concepts. We suggest that this latter nonclassical specification (which involves another variable type-the composite) will often be appropriate for ecological studies because of the multifaceted nature of our theoretical concepts.
   In this paper, we employ the use of meta-models to aid the translation of theory into SE models and also to facilitate Our ability to relate results back to our theories. We demonstrate our approach by showing how a synthetic theory of grassland biodiversity call be evaluated using SEM and data from a coastal grassland. In this example, the theory focuses on the responses of species richness to abiotic stress and disturbance, both directly and through intervening effects on community biomass. Models examined include both those based oil classical forms (where each concept is represented using a single latent variable) and also ones in which the concepts are recognized to be multifaceted and modeled as such. To address the challenge of matching SE models with the conceptual level of our theory, two approaches are illustrated, compositing and aggregation. Both approaches are shown to have merits, with the former being preferable for cases where the multiple facets of a concept have widely differing effects in the system and the latter being preferable where facets act together consistently when influencing other parts of the system. Because ecological theory characteristically deals with concepts that are multifaceted, we expect the methods presented in this paper will be useful for ecologists wishing to use SEM.

AB The problem of how to deal with species sensitivity differences to toxic substances has been addressed successfully with the species sensitivity distribution (SSD), yet this has not increased understanding about the underlying mechanisms of sensitivity. Other researchers have identified the mode of action of chemicals and also biological traits of species as determinants for sensitivity, yet no systematic approach combines these factors. To achieve this, first existing data on organophosphate, carbamate, and pyrethroid toxicity and mode of action and also species trait information were mined. Second, we linked taxon sensitivity to their traits at the family level to generate empirical and mechanistic hypotheses about sensitivity-trait relationships. In this way, a mode-specific sensitivity (MSS) ranking method was developed, and tested at the taxonomic level of family and genus. The application of several quality criteria indicated overall confidence in rankings, but confidence in exact taxon rank was less certain, due to data insufficiency for certain groups. The MSS rankings were found to be applicable for trait-based approaches and were successfully linked to existing trait data to identify traits with predictive potential. Although this empirical analysis cannot test causality relation-hips between traits and sensitivity, testable hypotheses were generated, for further experimental investigation. Single traits as well as combinations of traits can be used to predict laboratory sensitivity to the substances tested, although associations were not as strong as in previous studies. We conclude that existing trait data are not suitable for every trait-based research question and that important traits remain to be identified and quantified in relation to the processes of toxicity, i.e., the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics.

AB Clonal multiplication is a predominant type of reproduction in wetland species. However, both wetlands and plant organs of clonal growth are diverse, thus due to different stress factors operating in various wetlands preponderance of plants with specific clonal growth organs (CGOs) can be expected. To test this hypothesis the CGO spectra of wetland communities of the Netherlands were analysed, including a bog, a fen, heathland, a floodplain, river beds, fresh water pools, open salt water and a salt marsh. Moreover, it was evaluated whether different CGOs are characterised by different functional traits (shoot cyclicity, persistence of connections between ramets, number of offspring produced per year and lateral spread per year) in wetland species. Data on types of CGO, i.e., epigeogenous and hypogeogenous rhizomes, fragments and budding plants, stolons, tubers and bulbs, root-splitters, root-sprouters and special adaptations (turions) as well as their functional traits, were taken from the CLO-PLA 3 database. CGO spectra of wetland communities were analysed using two methods: comparison of observed vs. expected CGO spectra based on the presence/absence data and multivariate analysis (CCA) for inter-community differences considering species frequency. Moreover, relationships between CGOs and their functional traits were tested using multidimensional contingency tables. Apart from 26% of non-clonal species, the majority of wetland species was rhizomatous (51%). Other types of CGO were represented in less than 10% of species and root-derived CGOs were underrepresented (<2%) in comparison with terrestrial habitats. Among communities, fresh water pools and open salt water hosted higher proportion of species with fragments (similar to 10%) and turions (similar to 30%). Multivariate analysis divided wetland communities along the disturbance and hydric (water) gradients. Highly disturbed communities (salt marshes) were characterised by non-clonal species and species with root-derived CGOs. Aquatic communities (fresh water pools and open salt water) hosted species with the ability to spread by fragmentation and turions, contrary to permanently wet communities (bog and wet heathland) with the prevalence of species with epigeogenous rhizomes. It was also confirmed that the CGOs of wetland species differed in their traits. The most important functional trait characterising individual CGOs in the wetland flora was the degree of lateral spread (explained variability: 53%) followed by duration of persistence of connections between ramets (explained variability: 74%), which is in accordance with earlier distinguished strategies of clonal growth: integrator/splitter and spreading/non-spreading clones.

AB Restoration management frequently focuses on recreating suitable environmental conditions for a 'target vegetation'. This approach neglects the importance of habitat diversity and spatial configuration for individual species. Here, we investigate the role of environmental heterogeneity in a restoration context and report the response of aquatic macroinvertebrates to rewetting measures, which were taken to mitigate desiccation in a bog landscape. Because only parts of the study area were affected by re-wetting measures, changes in aquatic macroinvertebrates could be compared between re-wetted and non-rewetted parts. In addition, species were grouped into life-history strategies to test whether the invertebrate response differed between functional species groups. Total species numbers declined in the re-wetted parts and invertebrate assemblages became more similar both in terms of species and life-history strategies. These results indicate that large-scale re-wetting caused a functional homogenization. Changes in environmental conditions following re-wetting could be consistently related to changes in strategy composition. Retention of rainwater decreased the influence of groundwater. Here species increased that are adapted to physiological stress as well as those employing risk spreading, which indicates that environmental conditions had become harsher and less predictable. In contrast, reduced drainage locally increased groundwater influence, with life-history strategies indicating enhanced predictability of environmental conditions. Importantly, such conditions also characterise lagg zones and transitional mires in pristine raised bog landscapes, which are hotspots for biodiversity. Thus, while large-scale re-wetting decreased environmental heterogeneity, increasing the supply of groundwater seems a more promising restoration strategy for aquatic invertebrates in degraded peatlands.

AB The mechanoreceptive lateral line system in fishes detects hydrodynamic stimuli and plays a critical role in many fundamental behaviours, including orientation to water currents and the detection of stationary objects, prey and predators. Interspecific variation in lateral line structure may result from a process of functional adaptation, with the background level of hydrodynamic activity proposed as an important selective pressure. Here we use the eight species of the ecologically diverse New Zealand marine triplefin fish of the genus Forsterygion and one species from the sister genus Noto-clinops to investigate interspecific differences in lateral line morphology and to assess the relationship between lateral line characteristics and exposure to wave energy (fetch/depth ratio). Overall, the results show that lateral line traits are divergent between species, and these differences could in part be related to the wave exposure of the habitats that the species occupy. Specifically, numbers of canal neuromasts differed significantly between species, and most canal groupings increased in neuromast number with fetch/depth ratio, while the number and area of some superficial neuromast groupings decreased significantly with exposure. Distribution of superficial neuromasts along the trunk in the semi-pelagic and paedomorphic species F. maryannae differed from the other, demersal species, which may be associated with the unique lifestyle of this species and/or developmental processes. Canal architecture also differed considerably between species, but displayed no relationship with fetch/depth ratio. The results from this study indicate that some interspecific differences in lateral line organs may be a by-product of selection for habitat divergence. Future work should explore additional causal factors that might have influenced the evolution of lateral morphology in these species, including phylogenetic and allometric effects.

AB Ebenus pinnata Aiton occurs in few localities along the Mediterranean coast of North Africa from Libya to Morocco. In Libya this species grows in few places of the northwestern coastal mountain escarpment, where it is rarely recorded. The study site was located one in Msallata National Park area, Libya, at an altitude of 200-300 m. Three growth types were recognized in E. pinnata: ephemeral (E), modular (M), and coppiced (C) life-forms (functional types). The intra-population variations in the plant's functional types are interpreted as a plasticity mechanism for survival and existence under the given soil texture and micronutrient heterogeneity.
   Vegetative and reproductive traits of the three functional types of the species were investigated and the population demography, phenology, life table and fecundity schedule analyzed. Diversity in life cycle duration was observed with a broader phenological spectrum observed in C followed by M and E. Trade-offs between plant size, life span and population intrinsic rate of increase per capita are documented. Ephemeral and modular types exhibited a semelparous or r-selected life history, while the coppiced type showed an iteroparous or k-selected strategy.
   The lowest seed weight, germination and seedling emergence percentages were obtained for the E functional type; this demographic disadvantage was buffered, however, by a significantly lower seed predation. Moreover, a lower mortality rate in the germinable seeds-juvenile transition phase may be crucial for establishment of the E population from seeds. As a consequence, the population structure and life table analysis indicate that the E population is the most productive compared to the M and C populations. It has the highest density of individuals, attains the highest number of adults within the population and the highest values of adult survivorship (I-x), reproductive rate (R-o), and population growth rate (r) in the shortest generation time (T). The species persists in dry months as seeds in the case of ephemeral and modular types, and as vegetative stock in the coppiced type. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to smell is governed by the largest gene family in mammalian genomes, the olfactory receptor (OR) genes. Although these genes are well annotated in the finished human and mouse genomes, we still do not understand which receptors bind specific odorants or how they fully function. Previous comparative studies have been taxonomically limited and mostly focused on the percentage of OR pseudogenes within species. No study has investigated the adaptive changes of functional OR gene families across phylogenetically and ecologically diverse mammals. To determine the extent to which OR gene repertoires have been influenced by habitat, sensory specialization, and other ecological traits, to better understand the functional importance of specific OR gene families and thus the odorants they bind, we compared the functional OR gene repertoires from 50 mammalian genomes. We amplified more than 2000 OR genes in aquatic, semi-aquatic, and flying mammals and coupled these data with 48,000 OR genes from mostly terrestrial mammals, extracted from genomic projects. Phylogenomic, Bayesian assignment, and principle component analyses partitioned species by ecotype (aquatic, semi-aquatic, terrestrial, flying) rather than phylogenetic relatedness, and identified OR families important for each habitat. Functional OR gene repertoires were reduced independently in the multiple origins of aquatic mammals and were significantly divergent in bats. We reject recent neutralist views of olfactory subgenome evolution and correlate specific OR gene families with physiological requirements, a preliminary step toward unraveling the relationship between specific odors and respective OR gene families.

AB The field of Genomics has essentially been fuelled by medical research with developments in human gene therapy, such as the Human Genome Project. This major international undertaking resulted in a significantly increased sequencing capacity, a dramatic decrease in the time and cost of sequencing and also the computational effort required for the analysis. Marine biologists are taking advantage of this high throughput technology, hence, the tools are now available to answer questions that would have not been possible even five years ago. Genomics, in terms of studying DNA, can effectively define the genetic structure of populations and as a consequence the mapping of species boundaries, approximate drift in populations and accurately measure biodiversity. Studying transcribed sequences (RNA) enables the identification of changes at the cellular level associated with the adaptation of species to particular habitats and now, in our changing environment, predicts their ability to survive perturbation.
   The aim of this chapter is to familiarize the reader with the most commonly used genomic techniques that are available for population and adaptation studies. These encompass both DNA based methodologies for population studies and RNA based techniques for expression studies. Which technique is used largely depends on the species under study and the resources available. In environmental research it is important to understand that "resources" does not just refer to money for sequencing and library production, but also access to starting material and the ability to store the material successfully, often under difficult conditions. For example, a cruise to investigate a particular hydrothermal vent may only happen once in a researcher's lifetime and so material will be scarce, numbers will be limited and it may not be possible to store the material at a low enough temperature to prevent RNA degradation (thereby excluding expression studies). Also species availability tends to be on what is there at the time, rather than being able to perform a calculated choice for which species is the best to study. In other studies such as aquaculture or invasive species, a means has to be found to work on a particular species even if the material is intractable as there is a defined requirement for work in that area. So having outlined the techniques, the question is how to use them?
   In this chapter specific examples will be used to demonstrate how such techniques are being used to address these important ecological issues in the marine environment, concentrating on lower vertebrates (fish) and invertebrates. These encompass both population analyses and gene expression (functional) studies to understand how populations have adapted to and interact with, their environment.
   Ultimately, the challenge for the marine biologist is to utilize the tools produced for the study of model organisms, where significant amounts of sequence data exist (i.e. resource rich) and to develop these for non-model species, essentially from a zero base-line. It is not an easy task.

AB Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL12(T), a member of the globally important marine Roseobacter clade, comprises symbionts of cosmopolitan marine microalgae, including toxic dinoflagellates. Its annotated 4 417 868 bp genome sequence revealed a possible advantage of this symbiosis for the algal host. D. shibae DFL12(T) is able to synthesize the vitamins B(1) and B(12) for which its host is auxotrophic. Two pathways for the de novo synthesis of vitamin B12 are present, one requiring oxygen and the other an oxygen-independent pathway. The de novo synthesis of vitamin B(12) was confirmed to be functional, and D. shibae DFL12(T) was shown to provide the growth-limiting vitamins B(1) and B(12) to its dinoflagellate host. The Roseobacter clade has been considered to comprise obligate aerobic bacteria. However, D. shibae DFL12(T) is able to grow anaerobically using the alternative electron acceptors nitrate and dimethylsulfoxide; it has the arginine deiminase survival fermentation pathway and a complex oxygen-dependent Fnr (fumarate and nitrate reduction) regulon. Many of these traits are shared with other members of the Roseobacter clade. D. shibae DFL12(T) has five plasmids, showing examples for vertical recruitment of chromosomal genes (thiC) and horizontal gene transfer (cox genes, gene cluster of 47 kb) possibly by conjugation (vir gene cluster). The long-range (80%) synteny between two sister plasmids provides insights into the emergence of novel plasmids. D. shibae DFL12(T) shows the most complex viral defense system of all Rhodobacterales sequenced to date.

AB Structure and function of the Serio River (northern Italy) ecosystem have been evaluated analyzing macroinvertebrate community functional traits. Starting from traits such as Functional Feeding Groups (FFG), Functional Habit Groups (FHG), voltinism and drift behavior, we determined values that can integrate direct measurements of ecosystem attributes and can be used in restoration planning. We collected invertebrates and environmental data in eight sites representative of the longitudinal succession of Serio River environments. High values for most of the ecosystem attributes, indicating good functionality, were confined in three sites of the upstream alpine sector, while downstream the ecosystem was severely impaired and colonized by non-specialized, pioneer communities. The intrinsic information given by ecosystem attributes helped aid the understanding of the health of specific ecosystem functions, thus leading to evaluation of priorities in restoration efforts. This methodology can be a complementary tool in river quality assessment if macroinvertebrate quantitative data are available. Particularly, it can be used in accordance with the new quantitative sampling protocols being adopted in the European Union, and it can define new metrics in a multimetric evaluation system.

AB Bioturbating macrofauna can have major effects on their physical, biological and bio-geochemical surroundings, altering ecosystem functioning. Burrow builders increase the amount of sediment water interface over which oxidative exchange occurs, whilst organisms that 'bulldoze' through sediments homogenise and oxygenate the surface layers. Here we demonstrate that the bioturbating crab Austrohelice crassa performs the role of burrow builder in muddy and bulldozer in sandy sediments. Sediment reworking rates and expansion of the sediment water interface through A. crassa bioturbation were estimated from 4 parameters: burrow and crab density, burrow morphology, burrow permanency, and burrow maintenance, measured across a sedimentary gradient. Burrow decay rates (k, d(-1)), in combination with differences in burrow and crab densities, were responsible for changes in sediment reworking rates among habitats. Mean burrow permanency (1/k) varied from 25.7 d in mud to 10.8 d in muddy sand to 1.4 d in sand. In mud, where adult burrow density was greatest (207 m(-2)) and structures were stable, A. crassa burrows extended the sediment water interface by 147%, compared with 50% in muddy sand and 22% in short-lived sand burrows. In sand, 82% of the sediment available to A. crassa was mixed per lunar month (rising to 130% when including burrow maintenance values), whereas in mud and muddy sand, mean rates of sediment reworking dropped to 7.4%. These differences in the key bioturbational role of A. crassa between sediment types indicate that the impact of this species on ecosystem functioning will be highly habitat-dependent.

AB We explored the role of chromatic adaptation in shaping vertical phytoplankton community structures using a trait-based ecosystem model. The model included 1000 'phytoplankton types' and was applied to the oligotrophic South Atlantic Gyre in a 1-dimensional framework, where 'phytoplankton types' refers to the model phytoplankton that were stochastically assigned unique physiological characteristics. The model incorporates multi-spectral optics and light absorption properties for the different phytoplankton. The model successfully reproduced observed vertical gradients in the nitrate, bulk phytoplankton properties and community structure. Model phytoplankton types with Synechococcus-like spectral light absorption properties were outcompeted at depth, where eukaryote-like spectral properties were advantageous. In contrast, photoinhibition was important for vertical separation of high-light and low-light Prochlorococcus model analogues. In addition, temperature dependence was important for selection of phytoplankton types on the temperature gradient. The fittest, or successful, phytoplankton types were characterised by combinations of simultaneously optimal traits that suited them to a particular depth in the water column, reflecting the view that phytoplankton have co-evolved multiple traits that are advantageous in a particular environmental condition or niche.

AB To date, investigations of the positive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning among global marine ecosystems, and the management initiatives derived from these studies, have focused exclusively on species richness. We hypothesize that body size variations that occur among size-structured aquatic ecosystems subjected to exploitation may also contribute to these patterns. Our analyses of maximum lengths of 12 151 fish species from 56 exploited large marine ecosystems (LMEs) revealed a 2-fold variation in geometric mean lengths, that were strongly and negatively correlated with species richness. LMEs characterized by larger mean sizes were also skewed towards dominance by large species. The expected positive and significant correlation between mean fish length and latitude (characterized as Bergmann's Rule) was observed among North Atlantic, South Pacific, and Indian Ocean (southern latitudes) LMEs, but not in 3 other regions, including the North Pacific. In the North Atlantic, anomalous long-term declines in top predator catch rates (one measure of ecosystem functioning) occurred, and within temperate North Atlantic LMEs, species size distributions were more skewed towards large species relative to North Pacific LMEs. Our global analyses indicate that fish body size may act as a factor of considerable importance in mediating the relationship between global marine fish species richness and ecosystem functioning, and that management initiatives to ensure ecosystem stability in the face of exploitation should include the restoration and maintenance of this important functional trait.

AB Photoacclimation models are a prerequisite for accurate estimates of primary production in aquatic environments under typically variable light conditions. They generally start from empirical functions of the internal chlorophyll a (chl a) or nutrient quota (e.g. the Droop model). We propose that physiological variations in phytoplankton reflect phenotypic adaptation which maximizes the growth rate. Growth maximization has to account for indirect effects of the enhancement of carbon (C) acquisition by acclimation, primarily through concomitant changes in the intracellular nitrogen (N) budget. Our model expresses, for the first time, the indirect effect of alterations in N uptake on C assimilation by a parameter-free trade-off between the 2 uptake functions. The model explicitly prescribes optimal protein partitioning between N and C uptake and sub-partitioning into carboxylation (1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, Rubisco) and light harvesting. Applications to various published experimental data for different phytoplankton species support the validity of the optimality hypothesis and point to different flexibility in the re-organization of chloroplasts between taxa as well as to different time-scales on which photoacclimation operates. Simulations of a batch culture with the haptophyte Isochrysis galbana show that a decoupling in pigment N:C from cellular N:C may explain observed lag phases in chl a:C regulation. For diatoms, seemingly stronger constraints in intra-cellular stoichiometry determine the photoacclimative response to variable light regimes, as simulated and reported for Skeletonema costatum. N and chl a quotas correlate well in nutrient-limited chemostats of Thalassiosira fluviatilis, but in part decouple under light limitation. In N limited growth, non-linearity in N:C as expressed by the Droop function results from a combination of a linear quota dependency, down-regulation of relative carboxylation capacity, and increasing N costs of chl a synthesis at elevated growth rates. Our optimality assumption that includes indirect feed-backs through the concept of protein partitioning generates an accurate model for adaptation in physiological traits.

AB The importance of different functional traits of macrobenthos in benthic processes of the Southern Bight of the North Sea was investigated to estimate the effects of density declines and species loss on benthic ecosystem functioning. Two laboratory experiments were performed: before (winter, temperature = 10 degrees C) and after (summer, temperature = 18 degrees C) sedimentation of the spring phytoplankton bloom. Single species treatments of key species (Abra alba, Lanice conchilega and Nephtys sp.) with different functional traits were added to microcosms at 3 density levels (natural, lower, lowest) to account for possible density declines. Sediment-water exchanges of oxygen and nutrients, denitrification and bioturbation were measured. In absence of fauna, benthic mineralisation in the summer experiment was 2.0 times higher than in winter. Fauna stimulated microbial respiration more in summer (up to 100% in L, conchilega treatments) than in winter (negligible fauna effect). As chlorophyll a concentrations were similar in both seasons, the stronger fluxes in summer must be explained by a higher macrobenthic activity owing to the elevated temperature and better condition of the animals. Stimulation of mineralisation by the 3 species in the microcosms was different, and behaviour-related. Owing to its irrigation activity, the tube dweller L. conchilega had more pronounced influences on benthic respiration, nutrient release and denitrification than did the biodiffusers, A. alba and Nephtys sp. A. alba appeared to be a more effective bioturbator than Nephtys sp. Processes such as benthic respiration, nutrient fluxes, denitrification and bioturbation seem to be related to animal densities and therefore decreases in densities can possibly have implications for ecosystem functioning.

AB This study regards the analysis of leaf and root trait variability of the most invasive alien species and some common native species developing along central-southern Adriatic sand dunes in Italy. The results highlight that large leaf area, the reproductive period in late summer, a biennial/annual life cycle and thick, long roots are useful traits for the successful colonisation of the most invasive species Oenothera biennis, Erigeron canadensis and Xanthium orientale subsp. italicum along the mobile coastal dunes. These alien plants grow in spatial niches generated by eutrophication and human pressure, such as waste deposits on the beach and inter-dune gaps, flattened and altered by human trampling. We suggest that exotic species in the study area are currently occupying temporal and spatial niches that are not being exploited by native species and, therefore, they are not competing directly for the same resources.

AB Mechanisms controlling the successful invasion of resource demanding species into low-resource environments are still poorly understood. Well-adapted native species are often considered superior competitors under stressful conditions. Here we investigate the competitive ability of the resource demanding alien Acacia longifolia, which invades nutrient-poor Mediterranean sand dunes such as in coastal areas of Portugal. We explore the hypothesis that drought may limit invasion in a factorial competition experiment of the alien invasive versus two native species of different functional groups (Halimium halimifolium, Pinus pinea), under well-watered and drought conditions. Changes in biomass, allocation pattern, and N-uptake-efficiency (via (15)N-labeling) indicated a marked drought sensitivity of the invader. However, highly efficient drought adaptations of the native species did not provide a competitive advantage under water limiting conditions. The competitive strength of H. halimifolium towards the alien invader under well-watered conditions turned into a positive interaction between both species under drought. Further, low resource utilization by native species benefited A. longifolia by permitting continued high nitrogen uptake under drought. Hence, the N-fixing invader expresses low plasticity by continuous high resource utilization, even under low resource conditions. The introduction of novel traits into a community like N-fixation and high resource use may promote A. longifolia invasiveness through changes in the physical environment, i.e., the water and nutrient cycle of the invaded sand dune system, thereby potentially disrupting the co-evolved interactions within the native plant community.

AB Studies conducted in terrestrial ecosystems have shown that increasing plant diversity enhances ecosystem processes such as primary production. In marine systems, knowledge of how plant diversity influences ecosystem processes and higher trophic levels is still limited. To examine how plant richness and composition influence recruitment and colonization processes, defaunated eelgrass (Zostera marina), sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) and perfoliate pondweed (Potamogeton perfoliatus) were planted on an unvegetated, sandy bottom in all possible combinations in July and August. Both field experiments lasted 1 week. Our results showed that in these plant assemblages plant richness had a negative effect on faunal diversity (H') and evenness (I'), while total abundance showed strong temporal variation with weak, positive relationships with plant species richness in both August and July. Plant species composition had strong effects on amphipods (Gammarus spp.), thus both the abundance and biomass were higher in treatments containing P. perfoliatus. The colonization process was significantly influenced by the numerical dominance of a few faunal species, e.g. the settlement of lagoon cockles (Cerastoderma glaucum), and by the timing of the experiments. The results indicate that faunal colonization in these communities is rapid and significantly influenced by the traits of particular plant species. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biodiversity conservation does predominantly focus on protected natural areas, but has to consider also the usually Human-dominated matrix in which these natural areas are embedded. Here we study highway stormwater retention ponds, which may act as refuges for native flora and fauna and contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity in Human-dominated landscapes. However, the biodiversity supported by such artificial ponds has received little attention so far. Using standardised methods, we addressed the potential role of highway stormwater ponds as refuges by comparing aquatic macroinvertebrate communities (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Odonata and Gastropoda) in highway stormwater ponds with ponds in the wider landscape. As expected from their pollutant retention function, highway ponds differed in abiotic conditions from surrounding ponds. However, they supported aquatic macroinvertebrate communities at least as rich and diverse at the family level as surrounding ponds and exhibited similar variability in family community composition and structure. The main difference we observed was a higher abundance of small and/or short-lived invertebrates in the highway ponds. These similar community compositions and structures suggest that highway ponds contribute to the biodiversity of the pond network at a regional scale. Thus, road practitioners should consider highway ponds not only for their hydrological and pollutant retaining purposes but also as a possibility to increase the role of highway verges as a refuge and, consequently, landscape connectivity. The management of these water bodies should recognise their potential for biodiversity especially in Human-dominated landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Successful invasions are attributed to a combination of adaptations to biotic and abiotic conditions and many studies have highlighted the role of biological traits of invaders in their success. Among the most useful traits for successful establishment in a new ecosystem are the size of the invader and its diet and feeding habits. During the last twenty years, Dikerogammarus villosus has been one of the most successful invaders of large European rivers and lakes. However, regarding feeding habits, results were confusing and sometimes contradictory. In this study, we attempt to define the feeding strategy of D. villosus using their FA content according to sex and the seasonal and the spatial variation in its feeding habit. Our results indicated that D. villosus is rather unspecialized with plasticity in its feeding behaviour, switching between different functional feeding groups depending on seasons, habitats and available resources. The selection of high quality resources may hence provide a strong advantage during the invasion process by optimizing the growth and the reproduction of the invader.

   SYSTEM
AB The distribution range of fishes along an upstream-downstream gradient within a river basin is determined by the ecological requirements of each fish species. This differential pattern of distribution may suggest the occurrence of fish zones, where different functional guilds would prevail. The earliest concept of fish zonation highlighted the preferential position of several species in European rivers. Nowadays, there is a consensus that for a broad application of this concept, it is necessary to consider the division in functional groups along the downstream profile as related to reproductive, feed and population dynamics traits. However, for a number of tropical systems, such information does not exist. In this case, it is possible to use the fish family as a surrogate metric, by assuming that it fully covers common aspects of morphology, feeding, and behavior. Using this surrogate metric, we analyzed the distribution range of fish species along an elevation gradient in a typical Atlantic Forest basin in southeast Brazil. Our objective was to delimit fish zones based on the representativeness of some dominant fish families. Between 2006 and 2008, we sampled 42 sites from the estuary to the headwater creeks in elevations that varied from 3 to 783 m. The data were explored using the species (or family) occurrence, relative numerical abundance (N'), relative biomass (B'), and the importance index (IP). We applied the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to ordinate the sampling sites using the Jaccard distance calculated on the species occurrence matrix. Data on family importance were superimposed to the NMDS to check how the distribution and the abundance of the families were correlated to the ordination. We caught 64 species distributed among 25 fish families. Based on the dominance of some families, we propose that the fish assemblage in the Itanha,m river basin can be organized in four fish zones (FZ) and three transitory zones (TZ), which replace each other along the longitudinal gradient. The marine/estuarine fishes dominated in FZ1 and TZ1. The freshwater fishes were dominated by Characidae (FZ2), Heptapteridae (FZ3), and Gymnotidae (FZ4). TZ2 was equally dominated by Characidae, Loricariidae, and Heptapteridae. The distinct assemblage composition along the FZ's may relate to complex interactions involving seasonal patterns of variation in salinity levels (next to estuary), slope, presence of downstream barriers, and availability of food resources. We expect that the patterns observed in our study will also be presented in other coastal Atlantic Forest basins in Southeast Brazil.

AB Question
   What is the relationship between plant diversity and species turnover in coastal dune vegetation plots? How is the long-term change in species composition of vegetation plots related to shifts in functional traits, and what does it tell us about the dominant processes?
   Location
   Coastal dunes, the Netherlands.
   Methods
   Our data set comprised 52 years of vegetation data from 35 permanent plots in grassland/scrub/woodland vegetation. Vegetation dynamics were described in terms of changes in species composition and abundance, and shifts in 13 functional traits related to resources capture and forage quality, regeneration and dispersal.
   Results
   Species turnover in the plots was high, because of local extinction and colonization. Species-rich plots were more stable in terms of species abundance and composition compared with species-poor plots. Over time, the plots converged with respect to their abiotic conditions, as reflected by Ellenberg indicator values - indicating that the prevailing process was succession. The high species turnover reflected high invasibility: accordingly, the relative importance of annuals increased. Most newcomer annuals, however, were competitive generalists of little conservation value. The functional trait analysis allowed us to unravel the complexity of effects of disturbances and succession, and yielded information on the processes driving the observed vegetation dynamics.
   Conclusions
   In this study, small-scale species turnover was negatively related to species diversity, indicating more stability in species-rich communities. Regarding shifts in trait diversity, unifying filters appeared to be more dominant than diversifying filters. Counteracting this homogenization process poses a challenge for nature management.

AB Although predator-prey cycles can be easily predicted with mathematical models it is only since recently that oscillations observed in a chemostat predator-prey (rotifer-algal) experiment offer an interesting workbench for testing model soundness. These new observations have highlighted the limitations of the conventional modelling approach in correctly reproducing some unexpected characteristics of the cycles. Simulations are improved when changes in algal community structure, resulting from natural selection operating on an assemblage of algal clones differing in competitive ability and defence against rotifer predation, is considered in multi-prey models. This approach, however, leads to extra complexity in terms of state variables and parameters. We show here that multi-prey models with one predator can be effectively approximated with a simpler (only a few differential equations) model derived in the context of adaptive dynamics and obtained with a moment-based approximation. The moment-based approximation has been already discussed in the literature but mostly in a theoretical context, therefore we focus on the strength of this approach in downscaling model complexity by relating it to the chemostat predator-prey experiment. Being based on mechanistic concepts, our modelling framework can be applied to any community of competing species for which a trade-off between competitive ability and resistance to predators can be appropriately defined. We suggest that this approach can be of great benefit for reducing complexity in biogeochemical modelling studies at the basin or global ocean scale. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns of free-living marine nematodes were studied in Cienfuegos Bay, a tropical semi-enclosed basin in the Caribbean Sea. Taxonomic (to species level) and functional (biological trait) approaches were applied for describing the assemblage structure and relating it to abiotic environment based on a sampling scheme in six subtidal stations and three months. Biological trait approach added relevant information to species pattern regarding relationships between diversity patterns and the abiotic environment. The most common morphotypes were deposit feeding nematodes, with colonising abilities of 2-3 (in a scale from 1 to 5), tail conical cylindrical or filiforme and body slender; and their abundance were correlated with depth, organic matter and silt/clay fraction. In spite of a high turnover of species, functional diversity of assemblages did not change notably in space and time. A result probably due to sampling of the habitat pool of species and to low heterogeneity of the studied muddy bottoms. Chemical pollution (organic enrichment and heavy metals) and hydrodynamic regime possibly drove the biodiversity patterns. Spatial distribution of assemblages support the existence of two well differentiated basins inside the bay, the northern basin more polluted than the southern one. The low hydrodynamic regime would determine a poor dispersion of nematodes resulting in high spatial variance in the assemblage structure; and also the associated hypoxic conditions and pollutants in sediments can explain the dominance of tolerant nematode species such as Daptonema oxycerca, Sabatieria pulchra, Terschellingia gourbaultae, and Terschellingia longicaudata. A comparison of spatial-temporal patterns of biodiversity between Cienfuegos Bay and other semi-enclosed bays in temperate regions suggests several similarities: nematode assemblages are strongly influenced by anthropogenic disturbance, temporal trends are weak or overridden by spatial ones, and few cosmopolitan genera/species tolerant to pollution and hypoxic conditions are dominant.

AB Many traits of the skull of ceratophryines are related to the capture of large prey independently of aquatic or terrestrial feeding. Herein, detailed descriptions of the development of hyoid skeleton and the anatomy of muscles responsible for hyoid and tongue movements in Lepidobatrachus laevis and L. llanensis are provided and compared with those of other neo-batrachians. The aquatic Lepidobatrachus has special features in its hyoid skeleton that integrates a set of derived features convergent with the conditions observed in non-neobatrachian anurans and morphological novelties (e.g., dorsal dermal hyoid ossification) that deviate from the generalized pattern found in most frogs. Further, reduction of fibers of muscles of buccal floor, reduction or loss of hyoid muscles (m. geniohyoideus rama lateralis, anterior pair of in. petrohyoideus posteriores), small tongue, and simplified tongue muscles are also morphological deviations from the pattern of terrestrial ceratophryines, and other aquatic ceratophryids (e.g., Telmatobius) that seem to be related to feeding underwater. The historical derived features shared with Chacophrys and Ceratophrys involved in megalophagy are conserved in Lepidobatrachus and morphological changes in the hyoglossal apparatus define a unique functional complex among anurans.

AB In order to examine the role of environmental factors affecting foliar morphology, we performed a case study of leaf morphological variation of Ranunculus natans found in the arid zone of northwest China. We found that foliar phenotypic variation differed significantly between populations. We described substantial positive correlations between altitude and leaf area (LA) as well as leaf perimeter (LP), and also between longitude and number of teeth, along with dissection index (DI). The pH, conductivity, and salinity of the environment caused a significant decrease in both LA and LP. Ranked in terms of their impacts on leaf morphology, the six selected factors were: altitude > pH > conductivity > salinity > longitude > latitude. We found that foliar morphological variations are functional responses to water-quantity factors (e.g., altitude and longitude at regional scales) and water-availability relation factors (e.g., pH, conductivity, and salinity at local scales), rather than to temperature-relation factors (latitude). Therefore, altitude and longitude, along with pH, conductivity, and salinity, are the main factors that significantly influence foliar morphology in the arid zone of China. We found that main factors played major roles in plant phenotypic plasticity in a complex ecosystem, although different combinations and interactions of environmental and geographical factors in each local environment may obscure the general trends in trait changes along environmental gradients.

AB P>1. Reliable lotic ecological monitoring requires knowledge of river typology, environmental factors, the effect of stressors known here as 'pressures' and appropriate indicators of anthropogenically induced change. We sampled benthic macroinvertebrate, fish, bird and macrophyte communities along an intermittent Mediterranean river and analysed community structure (relative abundance) and function (metrics) relative to environmental and pressure gradients in order to identify suitable indicator group(s) for future monitoring and mitigation programmes.
   2. Principal components analysis revealed that scale-dependent longitudinal differences in valley form separated narrower higher lying sites and tributaries with good quality habitats from more open degraded sites lower down the river continuum on a small floodplain and large scale pressures describing changes in land use related to agriculture with associated physical bankside and channel impacts.
   3. Forward selection of variables in redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that reach scale environmental variables were selected more frequently than pressure variables for each organism group. Altitude and pH were highly redundant within and between groups, indicating essentially longitudinal structural and functional distribution patterns. Redundancy was far lower between selected pressure variables, but single or no pressure variables were retained for some organism groups indicating poor association of functional data, in particular, with the identified pressures. All RDA results indicated a longitudinal pH gradient, highlighting the combined effect of multiple environmental and pressure based mechanisms on organism groups.
   4. Large, mobile organisms such as fish and birds provided a reliable link between organism structure and function, environmental factors and physical disturbance of the channel, bankside and wider river corridor. Benthic macroinvertebrate and macrophyte structural data revealed distribution patterns in relation to water velocity, a key parameter for developing appropriate compensation measures.
   5. Results clearly show the importance of assessing patterns of both functional and structural change across multiple organism groups in order to identify typologically appropriate links with complex environmental and pressure gradients and develop and implement appropriate monitoring systems.

AB Man-made ponds are often created to compensate for the loss and degradation of wetlands, but little is known about the processes taking place in these artificial environments, especially at a community level. The macrofaunal assemblage and water chemistry of newly created ponds in three nearby areas in the NE Iberian Peninsula were studied during the first year of life of these ponds in order to (i) detect if any invertebrate assemblage structure change was taking place, (ii) evaluate the effect of local factors on the invertebrate assemblage in each site, and (iii) compare the information obtained by taxonomic and functional approaches. Although invertebrate colonization was rapid, no relevant changes in assemblage parameters were related to time, implying that more time may be needed to detect successional changes in invertebrate assemblages. Local factors-especially those related to hydrological stability-produced notable differences both in the assemblage parameters and in the taxonomic and functional compositions of the invertebrate fauna. Finally, information provided by the functional approach was redundant with respect to that obtained by the classical taxonomic approach: in these newly created systems, the high dominance of a small number of taxa makes the functional approach a simple biological traits analysis of the few dominant species.

AB Genomic islands have been shown to harbor functional traits that differentiate ecologically distinct populations of environmental bacteria. A comparative analysis of the complete genome sequences of the marine Actinobacteria Salinispora tropica and Salinispora arenicola reveals that 75% of the species-specific genes are located in 21 genomic islands. These islands are enriched in genes associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis providing evidence that secondary metabolism is linked to functional adaptation. Secondary metabolism accounts for 8.8% and 10.9% of the genes in the S. tropica and S. arenicola genomes, respectively, and represents the major functional category of annotated genes that differentiates the two species. Genomic islands harbor all 25 of the species-specific biosynthetic pathways, the majority of which occur in S. arenicola and may contribute to the cosmopolitan distribution of this species. Genome evolution is dominated by gene duplication and acquisition, which in the case of secondary metabolism provide immediate opportunities for the production of new bioactive products. Evidence that secondary metabolic pathways are exchanged horizontally, coupled with earlier evidence for fixation among globally distributed populations, supports a functional role and suggests that the acquisition of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters represents a previously unrecognized force driving bacterial diversification. Species-specific differences observed in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat sequences suggest that S. arenicola may possess a higher level of phage immunity, whereas a highly duplicated family of polymorphic membrane proteins provides evidence for a new mechanism of marine adaptation in Gram-positive bacteria.

AB The ability to adaptively alter morphological, anatomical, or physiological functional traits to local environmental variations using external environmental cues is especially well expressed by all terrestrial and most aquatic plants. A ubiquitous cue eliciting these plastic phenotypic responses is mechanical perturbation (MP), which can evoke dramatic differences in the size, shape, or mechanical properties of conspecifics. Current thinking posits that MP is part of a very ancient "stress-perception response system" that involves receptors located at the cell membrane/cell wall interface capable of responding to a broad spectrum of stress-inducing factors. This hypothesis is explored here from the perspective of cell wall evolution and the control of cell wall architecture by unicellular and multicellular plants. Among the conclusions that emerge from this exploration is the perspective that the plant cell is phenotypically plastic.

AB Question: How does the intensity of species interactions affect species and functional group composition of an annual plant community?
   Location: Sede Boqer, Negev Desert, Israel.
   Methods: The potential for competitive interactions in two annual plant communities (desert and coastal) from semi-stabilized sand dunes was manipulated by varying seed bank density and therefore the number of potentially interacting individuals. Communities were exposed to three different irrigation regimes, mimicking precipitation at the desert site, the coastal site, and an intermediate precipitation level. Plots were maintained for 3 years, and percentage cover of each species in the plots was recorded at the end of each growing season. We used redundancy analysis to test for effects of initial density, irrigation, and year on the species and functional group composition of the communities.
   Results: Initial density had significant effects on species composition, and these effects remained significant over 3 years, even as total community percentage cover became more similar among treatments over time. Density effects did not depend on resource availability (irrigation level). Functional group identity or individual plant size did not predict which species would be good competitors, and a species' competitive ability did not predict its abundance in the field.
   Conclusions: Species interactions strongly affect community composition, and those effects carry over into subsequent years such that competition does not lead to convergence in community structure over time. However, the particular changes in composition observed were not predictable by some of the traits that have been found important in individual-level experiments. We speculate that the outcome of competition in diverse communities will depend on multiple traits, in contrast to the outcome of individual-level pairwise experiments. We also speculate that the shift in composition with density could mean that local variation in density may contribute to maintenance of diversity in this system.

AB Sedimentary marine systems are often highly productive and perform important nutrient regeneration functions as they efficiently decompose organic material. In recent years the role of habitat effects and of species composition in ecosystem functioning has become of interest. Estuarine environments are frequently subject to considerable anthropogenic pressures whilst supporting a variety of habitats ranging from well sorted soft muds through biogenically stable sediments to highly mobile coarse sands. There is therefore considerable spatial complexity in habitat type and faunal composition. This study set out to observe the effects of altering the topographical habitat features of an estuarine mudflat on a range of porewater nutrient concentrations (NH(4)(+), NO(3)(-), NO(2)(-), PO(4)(3-) and SiO) collected from four depths (3, 5, 9, and 12 cm) and on faunal composition. Two treatments (Shelled Nets and Net Controls) were used to alter the topography from simple mud to a mussel shell crumble and were compared to un-manipulated Control areas. Sediment granulometry and organic matter content analyses alongside biological traits analysis of the fauna were also conducted. Differences were observed in porewater nutrient concentrations between the Control and both netted treatments at 5 cm depth only; the species diversity and abundance were also different in the netted treatments compared to the Controls, although no difference between the two manipulated treatments were observed. The changes in faunal composition were attributed solely to the altered topography and the observed nutrient changes were attributed to the faunal alteration rather than the topographical manipulation.

AB The cockle Cerastoderma edule L. occurs at commercially exploited densities within both species-poor and species-rich assemblages, dominating the faunal biomass and potentially acting as a key contributor to a number of ecological functions. The questions considered were: Is the delivery of ecological functions affected by the removal of C. edule? Does the biodiversity of the affected assemblage affect the extent to which it is altered? To explore these questions, adult cockles were removed from experimental plots at two shores in the North-West of England: a species-poor shore at Warton Sands, Morecambe Bay, and a more diverse shore at Thurstaston, Dee estuary. Impacts on the functioning of the systems were determined during a 4-month study in summer 2007 by direct measurements of benthic primary production, organic matter content and sediment granulometry, and by indirect analyses using Biological Traits Analysis. Removal of adult cockles led to significant changes in faunal assemblage composition and in the distribution of biological traits, with increased biodiversity and an increased prevalence of traits relating to opportunistic taxa observed following the removal of C. edule. These changes occurred at both study sites and hence were independent of the initial biodiversity of the assemblages. Sediment granulometry was significantly affected; however, surface chlorophyll and organic matter were not affected. This implies a minimal impact on these functions and a high degree of functional redundancy within the macrofauna. The implications of these findings and future areas of research are discussed.

AB Xylem traits were examined among 22 arid-land shrub species, including measures of vessel dimensions and pit area. These structural measures were compared with the xylem functional traits of transport efficiency and safety from cavitation. The influence of evolution on trait relationships was examined using phylogenetic independent contrasts (PICs). A trade-off between xylem safety and efficiency was supported by a negative correlation between vessel dimensions and cavitation resistance. Pit area was correlated with cavitation resistance when cross species data were examined, but PICs suggest that these traits have evolved independently of one another. Differences in cavitation resistance that are not explained by pit area may be related to differences in pit membrane properties or the prevalence of tracheids, the latter of which may alter pit area through the addition of vessel-to-tracheid pits or through changes in xylem conduit connectivity. Some trait relationships were robust regardless of species ecology or evolutionary history. These trait relationships are likely to be the most valuable in predictive models that seek to examine anatomical and functional trait relationships among extant and fossil woods and include the relationship among hydraulic conductivity and vessel diameter, between vessel diameter and vessel length, and between hydraulic conductivity and wood density.

AB Phylogenetic divergences have recently been included in analyses that aim to elucidate patterns of biodiversity in space and time. We introduce a generalized framework for two widely used phylogenetic diversity (PD) indices: Rao's quadratic entropy (QE) and Faith's PD. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to partition diversity simultaneously across evolutionary periods and spatial (e.g. local communities in a region) and/or time units (e.g. a community investigated yearly). From a study of rockfish hotspot diversity from the Southern California Bight, the analysis of PD revealed a recent decrease in the amount of fish caught from six evolutionary deep lineages, with implications for the community structure of this speciose group. This approach, which can also be applied to trees assembled from functional traits, contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms that underpin community organization and to the description of the consequences of human-driven impacts in the environment.

AB Aims:
   We compared phenotypic characteristics of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis derived from different sources including the intestinal tract of marine fish and freshwater fish, and cheese starter culture.
   Methods and Results:
   In the phylogenetic analysis based on partial 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequences (1371 bp), freshwater fish-, marine fish- and cheese starter culture-derived strains were identical to that of L. lactis subsp. lactis previously reported. Fermentation profiles determined using the API 50 CH system were similar except for fermentation of several sugars including l-arabinose, mannitol, amygdalin, saccharose, trehalose, inulin and gluconate. The strains did have distinct levels of halotolerance: marine fish-derived strains > cheese starter-derived strain > freshwater fish-derived isolate.
   Conclusions:
   Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis showed extensive diversity in phenotypic adaptation to various environments. The phenotypic properties of these strains suggested that L. lactis subsp. lactis strains from fish intestine have additional functions compared with the cheese starter-derived strain that has previously described.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   The unique phenotypic traits of the fish intestinal tract-derived L. lactis subsp. lactis might make them useful as a probiotics in aquaculture, and contribute to the development of functional foods and novel food additives, since the strains derived from fish intestines might have additional functions such as antibacterial activity.

AB Hemoglobin (Hb) polymorphism in cod is associated with temperature-related differences in biogeographical distribution, and several authors have suggested that functional characteristics of the various hemoglobin isoforms (HbIs) directly influence phenotypic traits such as growth rate. However, no study has directly examined whether Hb genotype translates into physiological differences at the whole animal level. Thus, we generated a family of juvenile Atlantic cod consisting of all three main Hb genotypes (HbI-1/1, HbI-2/2, and HbI-1/2) by crossing a single pair of heterozygous parents, and we compared their metabolic and cortisol responses to an acute thermal challenge (10 degrees C to their critical thermal maximum [CTM] or 22 degrees C, respectively) and tolerance of graded hypoxia. There were no differences in routine metabolism (at 10 degrees C), maximum metabolic rate, metabolic scope, CTM (overall mean 22.9 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C), or resting and poststress plasma cortisol levels among Hb genotypes. Further, although the HbI-1/1 fish grew more (by 15%-30% during the first 9 mo) when reared at 10 degrees +/- 1 degrees C and had a slightly enhanced hypoxia tolerance at 10 degrees C (e. g., 1 degrees C the critical O(2) levels for HbI-1/1, HbI-2/2, and HbI-1/2 cod were and 35.56% +/- 1.24%, 40.56% +/- 1.99%, 40.20% +/- 1.19% air saturation, respectively), these results are contradictory to expectations based on HbI functional properties. Thus, our findings (1) do not support previous assumptions that growth rate differences among cod Hb genotypes result from a more efficient use of the oxygen supply-that is, reduced standard metabolic rates and/or increased metabolic capacity and (2) suggest that in juvenile cod, there is no selective advantage to having a particular Hb genotype with regards to the capacity to withstand ecologically relevant environmental challenges.

AB In an age of triage,me must prioritize species for conservation effort. Species more isolated on the tree of life are candidates for increased attention. The rockfish genus Sebastes is speciose (>100 spp.), morphologically and ecologically diverse and many species are heavily fished. We used a complete Sebastes phylogeny to calculate a measure of evolutionary isolation for each species and compared this to their morphology and imperilment. We found that evolutionarily isolated species in the northeast Pacific are both larger-bodied and, independent of body size, morphologically more distinctive. We examined extinction risk within rockfish using a compound measure of each species' intrinsic vulnerability to overfishing and categorizing species as commercially fished or not. Evolutionarily isolated species in the northeast Pacific are more likely to be fished, and, due to their larger sizes and to life history traits such as long lifespan and slow maturation rate, they are also intrinsically more vulnerable to overfishing. Finally, the set of northeast Pacific species that are both fished and most intrinsically vulnerable to fishing are among the most evolutionarily distinctive. These findings suggest that, at least for this clade, extra attention should be paid to evolutionary distinctiveness when prioritizing species for conservation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, two three-table statistical techniques, are used to link traits of the region's dominant woody plants to environmental conditions over the last 15 000 calendar years (cal yr) through a fossil pollen record derived from lake sediments. Both RLQ and fourth-corner analyses revealed highly significant correlations between plant traits and temporal changes in environmental conditions. Axis 1 of the RLQ explained 92% of the total covariance between plant species traits and paleoenvironmental variables and was correlated most strongly with temperature and relative growth rate. In general, climate change during the cold period following deglaciation favored species such as Alnus sinuata and Pinus contorta that exhibit a "fast'' life-history strategy (e.g., high relative growth rate, short life span, low shade tolerance), whereas the relative climatic stability of the last 8000 cal yr favored species such as Tsuga heterophylla that exhibit a "slow'' life-history strategy (e.g., low relative growth rate, long life span, high shade tolerance). Fourth-corner analyses revealed significant correlations between all paleoenvironmental variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation, summer insolation, vegetation density) and most plant traits (relative growth rate, minimum seed-bearing age, seed mass, height, life span, and shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerances). The strongest correlation was between paleotemperature and height, reflecting the positive effect of temperature on plant growth and development and the overarching competitive advantage that height confers. This research demonstrates that environmental conditions interact significantly with life-history and stress tolerance traits over long ecological timescales to determine forest composition. Climate is the ultimate control on postglacial forest composition and species abundances, but long-term community assembly is also constrained through interspecific differences in plant traits.

AB The relationship of functional diversity and composition was studied in gradients of organically enriched sediments from four Mediterranean fish farms. Within-functional trait diversity was also used to examine the functional redundancy of specific functional traits. Characteristics considered to respond to different geochemical conditions of the sediment were chosen for the traits list of that organism and were classified into ecological and morphological traits. Each trait was split up into several categories chosen to encompass the range of possible attributes of all species. The abundance of species possessing the same code was summed for each sample. Functional codes analyses differentiated between the sediment types and the TOC states, confirming the sensitivity of the functional characteristics to the geochemistry of the sediment. Changes in species number and abundance in the compared sites determined the shifts of the functional processes and not the presence or absence of individual traits. The important functional codes for the homogeneity within the examined habitats were fewer in the disturbed areas indicating that the functioning of these ecosystems is significantly reduced.

AB Sesuvium portulacastrum L. (seapurslane) is a halophyte used as pioneer species in sand dune fixation and stabilization of saline soil. Studies on the morphological and molecular diversity were carried out for the 14 clones of Sesuvium collected from the different coastal regions of India. Significant differences were observed for morphological traits viz., length, width, diameter and area of leaf, internodal distance and stem diameter for different clones when compared with the clone from Gujarat state (GJ1). A UPGMA dendrogram for morphological traits based on the Pearson's similarity coefficient clustered the clones into three groups considering 80% polymorphism as criteria. Molecular diversity among the clones was studied using Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and markers specific to Ac homologous region. Of the total 749 RAPD loci amplified with 70 random primers, 294 were polymorphic with 39.25% diversity. A phylogenetic tree constructed with UPGMA and SHAN, grouped the clones into three major clades based on RAPD data. The molecular diversity studied with ITS and markers specific to Ac homologous region revealed 37.50% and 66.66% polymorphism and clustered the clones into three and four clades, respectively. The genetic diversity analysis revealed wide variations among the S. portulacastrum clones, reflecting a high level of diversity within the species which might be due to anthropogenic impact and geographic environmental conditions. Further, the various clones from the different eco-geographic coastal localities might have originated from native places of wild abundance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to evaluate both morphological and genetic diversity among the Sesuvium clones collected from the distant habitats of the coastal regions of the India.

AB The Arctic Ocean plays a critical role in controlling nutrient budgets between the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. Archaea are key players in the nitrogen cycle and in cycling nutrients, but their community composition has been little studied in the Arctic Ocean. Here, we characterize archaeal assemblages from surface and deep Arctic water masses using massively parallel tag sequencing of the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene. This approach gave a very high coverage of the natural communities, allowing a precise description of archaeal assemblages. This first taxonomic description of archaeal communities by tag sequencing reported so far shows that it is possible to assign an identity below phylum level to most (95%) of the archaeal V6 tags, and shows that tag sequencing is a powerful tool for resolving the diversity and distribution of specific microbes in the environment. Marine group I Crenarchaeota was overall the most abundant group in the Arctic Ocean and comprised between 27% and 63% of all tags. Group III Euryarchaeota were more abundant in deep-water masses and represented the largest archaeal group in the deep Atlantic layer of the central Arctic Ocean. Coastal surface waters, in turn, harbored more group II Euryarchaeota. Moreover, group II sequences that dominated surface waters were different from the group II sequences detected in deep waters, suggesting functional differences in closely related groups. Our results unveiled for the first time an archaeal community dominated by group III Euryarchaeota and show biogeographical traits for marine Arctic Archaea.

AB Evolutionary transitions between different environmental media such as air and water pose special problems with respect to skin permeability because of the dramatic changes in the driving gradients and nature of water exchange processes. Also, during the transitional periods prior to complete adaptation to a new medium, the skin is exposed to two very different sets of environmental conditions. Here, we report new data for transepidermal evaporative water loss (TEWL) and cutaneous resistance to evaporative water loss (R-s) of sea snakes that are transitional in the sense of being amphibious and semi-terrestrial. We investigated three species of sea kraits (Elapidae: Laticaudinae) that are common to Orchid Island (Lanyu), Taiwan. Generally, R-s of all three species is lower than that characteristic of terrestrial/xeric species of snakes measured in other taxa. Within Laticauda, R-s is significantly greater (TEWL lower) in the more terrestrial species and lowest (TEWL highest) in the more aquatic species. Previously reported losses of water from snakes kept in seawater exhibit a reversed trend, with lower rates of loss in the more aquatic species. These data suggest selection for adaptive traits with respect to increasing exposure to the marine environment. Thus, a countergradient of traits is reflected in decreased TEWL in aerial environments and decreased net water efflux in marine environments, acting simultaneously in the three species. The pattern for TEWL correlates with ultrastructural evidence for increased lipogenesis in the stratum corneum of the more terrestrial species. The skin surfaces of all three species are hydrophobic. Species differences in this property possibly explain the pattern for water efflux when these snakes are in seawater, which remains to be investigated.

AB Population regulation in pond-breeding amphibians has generally been assumed to occur through density dependence in the aquatic larval stage. However, studies examining terrestrial stage population dynamics are comparatively rare. As a consequence, the relative importance of density dependence In the terrestrial stage remains largely unknown. Here I determine the density dependence of terrestrial stage vital rates, including juvenile and adult survival, age and size at first reproduction, and reproductive traits, for a population of Wood Frogs, Rana sylvatica, in Michigan. I also examine the carry-over effects of density-dependent variation in metamorphic traits on adult demographic traits. During the 21 years of this study, the number of breeding adult males and females varied by an order of magnitude, whereas the number of metamorphic juveniles leaving the pond varied by two orders of magnitude. Adult male and female annual survival was negatively correlated with the number of males and females, respectively. Partial correlation coefficients (holding population size of the opposite sex, number of juveniles, and precipitation levels constant) indicated that variation in adult male and female survival was largely explained by variation in the number of males and females, respectively. Juvenile survival (both males and females) was strongly negatively correlated with juvenile population size but not juvenile body size, adult population size, or total precipitation. Partial correlations revealed that variation in juvenile population size was the single most important factor accounting for variation in male and female juvenile survival, and female age and size at first reproduction. Clutch size and egg size also varied with juvenile population size independent of female body size. At lower juvenile population sizes, female juveniles matured earlier, at a larger body size, and produced larger numbers of smaller eggs than at high juvenile population sizes. Although juvenile body size was positively correlated with male and female reproductive body size and total clutch weight, juvenile fitness traits, in general, were more closely related to variation in juvenile population sizes. Larval traits did not affect adult fitness traits in the terrestrial stage. A nonlinear logistic model best described the functional relationship between juvenile population size and the number of surviving males, females, and total adult biomass. As number of juveniles produced increased, the number of surviving adult males, females, and total biomass plateaued, suggesting that the terrestrial environment limited adult population size. My results demonstrate that density-dependent effects operating in the terrestrial stage may be important in regulating Wood Frog population size.

AB Although many species face numerous predators in nature, the combined impact of multiple predators on the inducible defenses of prey has rarely been studied. Prey may respond with an intermediate phenotype that balances the risk from several sources or may simply respond to the most dangerous predator. I examined the separate and combined effects of the presence of shell-breaking (crabs, Cancer productus) and shell-entry (seastars, Pisaster ochraceus) predators fed conspecific snails on the defensive shell morphology and antipredator behavior of a marine snail (Nucella lamellosa). When exposed to each feeding predator separately, snails responded with a combination of morphological defenses that reflect the attack mode of the predator and a generalized behavioral response. Snails responded to feeding crabs by increasing refuge use and producing a thick, rotund shell. Snails responded to feeding seastars with increased refuge use but produced elongate shells with high spires that allowed for greater retraction of the soft tissue. Seastar-induced phenotypes reduced susceptibility to seastars relative to crab-induced phenotypes, but crab-induced phenotypes did not significantly reduce susceptibility to crabs, indicating an asymmetrical functional trade-off. When feeding predators were combined, snails produced a morphological phenotype similar to that expressed in the presence of the predator that imposed the highest mortality at the population level, suggesting that predator-induced morphology was prioritized according to predation risk. These results suggest that prioritizing conflicting defenses according to predator danger may be a common strategy for prey responding to combined predators, particularly in conjunction with generalized behavioral responses that reduce overall risk in multiple-predator environments.

AB The external morphology of frog larvae is predicted to vary among habitats, for a variety of functional reasons. I performed a phylogenetic comparative study to test whether correlations between habitat and the shape of the tadpole and its oral disc are adaptive in 82 species from south-eastern Australia in the families Hylidae and Myobatrachidae. Habitat distributions and phylogenetic relationships were compiled from the literature and shape was quantified using geometric morphometric analysis of published drawings. Results indicate that shape evolved towards different optima in different habitats while also showing appreciable levels of phylogenetic inertia. Within myobatrachids, evolution of terrestrial tadpoles was associated with a short and shallow head/body and a shallow tail. In aquatic species, the use of benthic microhabitats was correlated with a long shallow tail, dorsal eye position, shallow head/body and ventral mouth with robust jaw sheaths. Even traits with evidence for adaptation evolved slowly in response to habitat shifts, usually requiring >= 10 million years to evolve half-way to a new optimum. Although these findings support adaptive evolution of tadpole body form, they also highlight a strong influence of ancestral character states and indicate that phenotypes in extant species are partly maladaptive.

AB Selecting indicators of the response of the benthic community to fishing effort restrictions is important for testing the efficacy of management actions that seek to minimise ecosystem degradation. Components of epifaunal communities are sensitive to trawling, and concordant measurements of trawling effort can be used to establish a link between response and impact variables. Trawling effort on Mediterranean fishing grounds can be assessed, but the lack of data from communities inhabiting these areas makes establishing the response-impact relationship difficult. This study addresses this challenge by investigating benthic communities from the NW Mediterranean subjected to a gradient of fishing effort, and confirms that indicators based on functional components of epibenthos can be a useful tool to describe the response of communities to disturbance across habitat types.

AB The development of ecosystem-based indicators requires the broadening of a view of the community, from fish species to all the species (macrobenthic and fish) correctly captured by a given sampling gear. Many scientific surveys already have such integrated databases. The present note aims to demonstrate that existing databases, herein from dedicated coastal nursery surveys, are actually underexploited. Such databases contain information on non-commercial taxa, which could greatly improve our knowledge on the organisation and functioning of coastal ecosystems. Using two datasets, a "complete" dataset composed of commercial and not-commercial epibenthic trawled species (fish and invertebrate) and a "subset" dataset characterized by commercial and routinely surveyed species (mainly fish and cephalopods), different measures of functional diversity are compared to identify the functional gains of including epibenthic species. The results show that, when included in the analyses. epibenthic taxa provide gains of functional information, associated mainly with the community feeding traits, i.e. organisms composing the primary and secondary consumer levels of the coastal nursery food web. Failure to include some of the primary (zooplanktivores and suspension feeders) and secondary consumers (detritivores-scavengers) in coastal survey analyses may, for instance, hamper our understanding of energy flux between the benthic and water column compartments of these ecosystems. The results also suggest that the exclusion of some taxa associated with these two food web compartments, may lead to the underestimation of the functional redundancy in coastal ecosystems.

Some of these characters may be proposed as "hard traits" in Plant Functional Type studies.

   SYMMORIIFORMES), WITH COMMENTS ON DORSAL FIN MODULARITY
SO JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY
DT Article
ID FISHES
AB A bizarre "spine-brush complex" is found only in extinct symmoriiform chondrichthyans (Order Symmoriiformes). Its structural complexity makes the spine-brush complex a rich source of morphological characters for phylogenetic analysis, and it has been used as a basis for their family-level subdivision. Development of the complex is sex-linked in one of the three symmoriiform families customarily recognized (Falcatidae), but its distribution within members of the other two families (Symmoriidae, Stethacanthiclae) is poorly documented. Consequently, earlier family-level diagnoses (which were largely based on the presence or absence of the spine-brush complex) are probably misleading. Some features of the spine-brush complex can be homologized with structures found in "normal" shark dorsal fins, suggesting that the spine-brush complex is a highly specialized first dorsal fin. The spine-brush complex may have arisen by co-option of the first dorsal fin module, possibly involving its suppression in females and postdisplacement (delayed development) in males, plus acquisition of several apomorphic traits, unlike in chimaeroids and actinistians where co-option of the first dorsal fin module is not sex-linked or developmentally postdisplaced. The evolutionary history of dorsal fin modularity is examined. In gnathostomes. co-option is typically confined to the first module, whereas the second is more highly conserved, retaining its functional role in aquatic locomotion.

   Sixty-six stations from the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent sector of the Southern Ocean, 65 degrees N to 57 degrees S.
   Estimation of SL by means of rarefaction. Stepwise evaluation of SL and SR relationships by means of the second-order corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) after locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) and linear fitting, analysis of saturation effects by means of slopes of species accumulation curves (log-log plots).
   Latitudinal gradients were present for SL and SR, and were asymmetric between the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Relatively low species richness was encountered for the Southern Ocean. Asymmetry at the regional level by means of higher SR was attributed to area effects in the South Atlantic. Log-log plots indicated saturation of local assemblages and dependence on environmental factors. SL was related to productivity; this relationship was hump-shaped. SR was positively related to area size and negatively to seasonality of production. Biogeographical effects were indicated in that SR peaks coincided with overlap zones of boreal and tropical faunas as a consequence of historical faunal exchange processes.
   The stepwise approach allowed for distinction between effects of area size, productivity and biogeographical processes on diversity at local and regional scales. Productivity in particular is important in two ways. At the local scale, the link of productivity to SL is explained by a successional-functional hypothesis of resource utilization, whereas the seasonality effect for SR reinforces the hypothesis of dependence of deep-sea fishes on seasonality of production through changes of life-history traits. The causes of low Antarctic faunal diversity remained unresolved.

AB Channel reconfiguration is a popular but controversial approach to river restoration, and ecological responses to channel reconfiguration have not been rigorously assessed. We compared physical-habitat variables, taxonomic and functional-trait diversities, taxonomic composition, and functional-trait abundances between 24 pairs of upstream (control) and downstream reconfigured (restored) reaches in 3 catchment land uses (urban, agricultural, rural) across the North Carolina Piedmont. We asked how environmental filters and functional species traits might provide insight to biological responses to restoration. Taxonomic and functional-trait differences between control and restored reaches suggest that restoration affected aquatic assemblages only in agricultural and rural catchments. Our results highlight 2 important aspects of channel reconfiguration as a restoration practice. First, responses to restoration differ between agricultural/rural and urban catchments, possibly because of modified hydrological regimes caused by urbanization. Second, we find evidence that channel reconfiguration disturbs food and habitat resources in stream ecosystems. Taxa sensitive to disturbance were characteristic of control reaches, whereas insensitive taxa were characteristic of restored reaches. Abundances of traits related to reproduction (voltinism, development, synchronization of emergence, adult life span), mobility (occurrence in drift, maximum crawling rate, swimming ability), and use of resources (trophic and habitat preferences) differed significantly between control and recently restored reaches. Our results suggest that taxa in restored habitats are environmentally selected for traits favored in disturbed environments. Our work suggests how functional-trait approaches could benefit the practice of river restoration when used to target restoration activities and to develop informed expectations regarding recovery following restoration activities.

AB Community assembly processes are thought to shape the mean, spread, and spacing of functional trait values within communities. Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient.
   We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions.
   We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils.
   We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.

AB Throughout the world's oceans a wide variety of floating plastics are found, among which buoys stand but for their high floatability and diversity and abundance of associated organisms. Between 2001 and 2005, we conducted 25 ship surveys in the Bay System of Coquimbo (BSC), during which we registered 34 detached buoys floating between 1 and 45 km from the coast. The objective of this study was to infer the possible origin of these buoys, identify the associated biota and characterize their biological traits. Short-term drift experiments (30 min) showed that buoys without rope responded primarily to the velocity and direction of the wind, while buoys with ropes (3 m length) followed surface currents. Using the wind velocity and direction during the 12 h before capture of the detached buoys, we estimated the hypothetical trajectories of these buoys during that time period. Results indicated that most buoys originated from aquaculture facilities in the BSC. A total of 134 different species from 14 phyla was found on 18 anchored (91 species) and 22 detached (116 species) buoys sampled. Community composition was similar among buoys - 54 % of all species were common for anchored and detached buoys-but a higher number of rare species occurred on detached buoys. Buoys do not seem to lose but rather gain organisms after detachment. The most common functional groups on these buoys were mobile species, suspension-feeders and species with sexual reproduction, separate sexes, internal fertilization and direct or very short larval development. Fouling communities on detached buoys were mostly in advanced successional stages, comprising diverse species (including several non-indigenous species) adapted to the conditions at the sea surface. These results suggest that floating buoys may transport associated species over extensive distances, thereby also contributing to the spread of non-indigenous species.

AB Changes in plant species richness and composition, vegetation structure, ecosystem functioning and soil nutrients following invasion of Banksia woodland and Eucalyptus marginata forest biomes by the introduced soilborne multihost plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamom were determined using space-for-time substitution of diseased and adjoining healthy areas. In most study areas, canopy closure, basal area and number of plant species were significantly lower in old diseased compared with adjoining healthy areas, with diseased front intermediate between the two. In half of the study areas, percentage ground cover and total plant species cover were significantly lower in old diseased compared with adjoining healthy areas, with diseased front intermediate between the two. Evenness, Shannon-Weiner H and Simpson's D did not significantly change between disease status for the majority of study areas. For ordination of percentage canopy closure and ground cover there was separation of study areas along a disease status gradient and a weak soil fertility gradient. There was significantly less percentage organic carbon, extractable phosphorus and extractable and total potassium in old diseased areas compared with adjoining healthy areas for one-quarter to a third of the study areas. Total phosphorus changed significantly between disease status, but this was due to higher levels in diseased front compared with the old diseased or adjoining healthy areas. For all study areas there was no significant effect of disease status on percentage total nitrogen and pH. The cover of a majority of plant species did not change significantly between disease status with 16% of the total number of perennial species in healthy areas significantly decreasing and 10% significantly increasing in cover in old diseased compared with adjoining healthy areas. As with significant differences in cover between disease status, change in cover of a majority of plant species was not significantly correlated with canopy closure. Cover of 20% of the total number of perennial species in healthy areas was significantly linearly positively correlated with canopy closure and the cover of 10% of plant species was significantly negatively correlated with canopy closure. These species were herbs and shrubs from a range of families with a mixture of functional properties such as Phytophthoria cinnamomi susceptibility, response to fire, rooting type and mycorrhizal association. The paper concludes with a conceptual analysis of core issues and those that cascade out of core issues involved in pathogen and patch plant community interactions.

AB The taxonomic and functional structure of oligochaete and chironomid communities ill a stony-bottomed river reach was investigated with respect 10 Substrate and hydraulic conditions. Combined oligochaete and chironomid data were analyzed to search for main gradients and the separate data sets were analyzed to identify the most important variables determining the Structure of the Communities. Preferences for particular hydraulic conditions, expressed as Froude number, were calculated for 29 most abundant taxa. The results of Correspondence Analysis (CA) indicated that the main gradient in the data could be explained by hydraulic conditions and, inversely, by the amount of sedimented particulate organic matter (POM). The second CA axis probably reflected the quantity of the available food and space resources. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed the amount of sedimented POM as the most important variable explaining 21 and 24% of the variance in the oligochaete and chironomid data, respectively. Among the other variables, the Occurrence of aquatic vegetation, variability of near-bottom current velocity and substrate roughness were the most important. In the case ofchironornids, the proportions of functional feeding strategies changed along the gradient of hydraulic conditions: the proportions of predators, active filter-feeders and collectors/gatherers decreased with the increasing hydraulic stress, while the proportion of grazers/scrapers increased. Nevertheless, in the case of oligochaetes, the proportions of functional feeding strategies did not follow the gradient of hydraulic Conditions. Although the total abundance of both oligochaetes and chironomids was independent of hydraulic conditions, only few oligochaete taxa were able to succeed in hydraulically rough conditions and most oligochaete taxa were found only in pools. On the other hand, chironomids showed high taxa richness, which seemed to be limited by the quantity of the available food and space resources rather than hydraulic stress.

AB Channelization is the creation of man-made structures that resect, realign, or endose aquatic systems in order to prevent flooding or to modify their flows for various land uses. The present study examined the impact of this human pressure on the spatial and temporal dynamics of small streams. The physical and floristic characteristies of seventeen reaches in four French rivers were surveyed six times over the course of two years. Macropyte communities were divided into three biological groups vascular plants, macroalgae and bryophytes. We used plant functional traits to understand the effects of channelization on community structure. Our results suggest that channelization affected the spatio-temporal dynamic of physical and floristic composition. Channelized reaches were shallower and narrower than non-channelized reaches. i.e. control reaches. They also exhibited different substrate types and dominant species. Difference were mainly observed at the macrohabitat scale, i.e. the pool/triffle scale, within the selected reaches. Alteration in spatio-temporal dynamics of physical and plant composition coul be linked to species biological traits. Vascular plants and macroalgae in channelized reaches used a variety of adaptive strategies (e.g. small versus tall size) which allowed them to persist depite environmental differences, whereas plants in control reaches showed a combination of intermediate strategies. Bryophytes were mainly found in control reaches with the exception of Fontinalis antipyretica. These findings could serve as guidelines for future channelization projects and for conservation measures to preserve the dynamics of natural streams.

AB Understanding how species loss influences ecosystem function is a contemporary issue in ecology. However, most research has focused on species loss at one trophic-level. We explored the relationship between functional diversity (FD) and species richness separately for trees and aquatic leaf-shredding detritivores. For trees, we collected information on species-specific leaf tissue chemistry and species co-occurrences in the mid-Atlantic region (USA). For shredders, we used a published trait database with information on communities from 38 streams in the same region. We used a clustering algorithm to estimate FD for each community and for randomly assembled communities. If FD was high, we concluded that species loss was important to change in function; if low, species were functionally redundant and insensitive to species loss. We found tree FD to be significantly different than expected, but shredders exhibited FD levels similar to patterns based on random assembly. Furthermore, there were more leaf species exclusively associated with very high or very low levels of functional diversity compared to shredders. This approach revealed greater implications for leaf than shredder species loss for litter breakdown.

AB Morphological traits that appear multiple times when mapped onto molecular phylogenies have been associated with character lability. In an ecological context, functional characters, if labile, could confer advantages for adaptation to specific habitats. Bamboo corals are long-lived, deep-sea octocorals characterized by an obvious modularity, which affords diverse branching morphologies in the Keratoisidinae subfamily. We reconstructed molecular phylogenies using 16S (mitochondrial) and ITS2 (nuclear) ribosomal DNA, and obtained 39 ITS2 and 22 16S sequences from 22 different specimens. The molecular topologies showed Keratoisidinae genera as polyphyletic. Twelve morphological characters were chosen to make the ancestral character reconstruction, none of which exhibited character states forming monophyletic groups when mapped onto molecular phylogenies. The different character states appeared as having been gained and lost multiple times. Modular organisms such as bamboo corals could have higher character evolvability than unitary organisms. Complexity arising from simple body plans is a typical characteristic in most modular organisms, such as plants and colonial marine invertebrates. However, bamboo corals may also exhibit phenotypic plasticity associated with continuous characters, given that they can respond to extrinsic controls. Our results also have direct repercussions on Isididae taxonomy, since morphological characters have been used for their classification. Consequently, we suggest that the current taxonomy of the group is re-evaluated and that the different mechanisms regulating modularity and character evolution in bamboo corals are explored,

AB The spatial ecology of seabirds has greater precedence today than ever before because of impacts on the marine environment from human exploitation, pollution, and climate change. Specific life history traits make seabirds particularly sensitive to these impacts, currently driving many species to unsustainable population declines. To evaluate the risk posed by human activities, we need integrative studies on seabird abundance, distributions, and movements in relation to the biophysical marine environment. Also interpreting the limits of these relationships is fundamental to understanding historical constraints and behavioural adaptations of seabirds that are shaped by evolutionary processes. In this Theme Section, we assembled 4 review papers and 10 case studies that highlight some of the latest techniques to study seabird spatial ecology. This includes the application of tracking tags, ship-based surveys, and remotely sensed environmental data, to characterize seabird movement patterns, fine scale behaviour, and overall distribution combined with measures of the oceanic habitats to enhance our understanding of the functional role that seabirds play. Overall, this knowledge is crucial for understanding and predicting the impacts that fisheries, climate change and pollution are exerting on marine ecosystems and will provide opportunities for developing marine protected areas, conservation action plans and species management.

AB A key feature of intertidal marine systems is the well-defined gradient of environmental stress generated by tides. In this study, resilience, i.e. the speed of recovery along this gradient, was explored in a temperate rocky shore system. The purpose was to test whether there was a negative relationship between environmental stress and resilience, as suggested by some previous empirical studies. The rate of recovery of macroalgal assemblages following disturbance was assessed by comparing cleared and control plots at 4 different tidal heights at 3 sampling times, The results indicated that resilience was greater at higher levels of environmental stress, contrary to previously documented patterns. The number of potential colonisers also decreased at more stressful elevations. This difference in the size of the available pool of species could in itself make re-assembly simpler and faster at higher, harsher elevations. The influence of environmental stress on resilience is possibly dependent on the degree and characteristics of the stress factors and the traits of the particular species pool. During the course of this study, dramatic changes in control assemblages were detected, with occasional local extinctions of canopy-forming species. Even when naturally species-poor assemblages (such as those from higher tidal elevations in rocky shores) may show high resilience, impoverished systems feasibly exhibit a different behaviour. An insightful approach for future research would be to test the effect of non-random extinctions in assemblages naturally varying in the richness of potential colonisers,

AB The effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning has proven variable both within and among manipulative studies. Species richness is the most commonly used measure of biodiversity in such studies, but the range of species' functional traits (functional diversity), not the number of species per se, likely underpins a key mechanistic link between species richness and ecosystem functioning. However, the majority of experiments that have examined the effect of functional diversity have manipulated functional group richness, an approach recognised to suffer numerous limitations. Continuous measures of functional diversity avoid many of these limitations, but the relationship between continuous functional diversity and the magnitude of ecosystem processes has been largely untested. Using one vs two-species mixtures of rock pool macroalgae as a model, we conducted a field experiment to determine the effect of a continuous measure of functional diversity (functional attribute diversity, FAD, the degree of functional differentiation based on four functional traits) on the magnitude of net primary productivity and overyielding, based upon two alternative null-models. The total magnitude of productivity was largely determined by the identity of species present, not FAD. However, FAD proved to be a good predictor of overyielding (variation in productivity after the dominant effects of species identity had been accounted for). Furthermore, despite differences in the mean magnitude of the effect of combining species, the positive relationship between FAD and overyielding was consistent according to both additive and substitutive null-models. Our findings imply that whilst knowledge of species' independent contributions remains indispensable in the prediction of biotic effects on ecosystem functioning within a trophic level, continuous measures of functional diversity should be used as a supplementary tool to predict the magnitude of overyielding, thereby refining predictions.

AB We explored differences in leaf nutrient contents between species from Mediterranean shrublands with the ability to resprout after disturbances such as fire (resprouters) and others without this capacity (non-resprouters). Since it is to be expected that resprouting capacity is related to a more conservative use of nutrients, we hypothesize that resprouter and non-resprouter species will differ in their leaf nutrient concentrations.
   We measured the following leaf traits: leaf carbon content (LCC), leaf nitrogen content, leaf phosphorous content (LPC), leaf potassium content, leaf calcium content (LCaC), leaf magnesium content and leaf sodium content, in 30 woody species coexisting in a coastal shrubland. We also considered the influence of species' taxonomic affiliation in our analysis.
   Non-resprouters had higher LPC and LCaC than resproutcr species, and lower LCC, which could be related to their cell and life-history properties. This study also suggests that non-resprouter species have more P in their leaves and are less limited by P than resprouter species.
   Overall, the differences in leaf nutrient contents suggest that shifts in the proportion of resprouter and non-resprouter species resulting from changes in the fire regime may have effects on the functional properties of the ecosystem.

AB Background: Phytoplankton show a wide range of maximum growth rates (mu(max)), with no obvious advantage to having a low mu(max).
   Aims: To explore advantages for phytoplankton in having mu(max) values commensurate with the rate of nutrient supply in their environment, making use of a mechanistic model describing their growth.
   Methods: In contrast with the typical construction of quota-based models of microalgal growth, which scale the maximum nutrient uptake rate to mu(max), a more realistic description of excess nutrient transport capacity endows organisms of lower mu(max) with a competitive advantage for nutrient acquisition. This, in turn, enables the retention of a higher organismal nutrient status at low-nutrient concentrations. Thence low mu(max) organisms may be expected to have lower intrinsic death rates, and also faster response times to capitalise on nutrient spikes.
   Results: Of the traits modelled, the lowering of death rate appears the most important, enabling cells of low mu(max) to out-compete their high mu(max) counterparts at low-nutrient concentration. An ability to recover more rapidly from nutrient stress is of lesser importance, and is unable to counter differences in mu(max).
   Conclusions: Descriptions of features such as those modelled define properties of plankton functional types and also provide trade-off characteristics for placement within models considering emergent properties of plankton communities.

AB Cellular communication is mediated primarily by chemical signal molecules. This suggests that during the course of evolution, organisms in which this form of communication developed have greatly increased their chances of survival, ensuring that this trait passes on to their descendents. Interestingly, for the most part, these signaling molecules and their apparent systems/mechanisms have remained relatively intact during evolution. However, this principle of conservation does not preclude events that may lead to an old signal system being used in a new functional capacity. A classical example of this phenomenon can be observed in the immune and neuroendocrine systems. They share a common pool of identical molecules, i.e., opioids, involved in the maintenance of homeostasis, which occurs in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Specifically, many of these protein molecules, active as chemical messengers, are also derived from larger polypeptide gene products and classified into three families: the proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the proenkephalin and the prodynorphin families. In marine mussels the immunocytes produce and react to opioid peptides, demonstrating autocrine and paracrine signaling. Under stressful stimuli immune system alteration occurs, in part mediated by opioid signals, coupling these processes and demonstrating neuroimmune-regulatory phenomena. Additionally, both immune and nervous systems contain mammalian-cytokine-like molecules, which also interact with the endogenous opioid system. Recent data have demonstrated the presence of novel opiate receptors on human multi-lineage progenitor cells. Interestingly, these same receptors are found on molluscan neural cells, suggesting their early evolutionary origins and conservation. The only data on molluscan stem cells are the presence of CD14- and CD-34-like molecules on prohemocyte membranes. These data suggest that the highly sophisticated mammalian immune and neuroendocrine systems had their origins in their invertebrate counterparts.

AB The plastic alterations of clonal architecture are likely to have functional consequences, as they affect the spatial distribution of ramets over patchy environments. However, little is known about the effect of mechanical stresses on the clonal growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clonal plasticity induced by mechanical stress consisting of continuous water current encountered by aquatic plants. More particularly, the aim was to test the capacity of the plants to escape this stress through clonal plastic responses.
   The transplantation of ramets of the same clone in two contrasting flow velocity conditions was carried out for two species (Potamogeton coloratus and Mentha aquatica) which have contrasting clonal growth forms. Relative allocation to clonal growth, to creeping stems in the clonal biomass, number and total length of creeping stems, spacer length and main creeping stem direction were measured.
   For P. coloratus, plants exposed to water current displayed increased total length of creeping stems, increased relative allocation to creeping stems within the clonal dry mass and increased spacer length. For M. aquatica, plants exposed to current displayed increased number and total length of creeping stems. Exposure to current induced for both species a significant increase of the proportion of creeping stems in the downstream direction to the detriment of creeping stems perpendicular to flow.
   This study demonstrates that mechanical stress from current flow induced plastic variation in clonal traits for both species. The responses of P. coloratus could lead to an escape strategy, with low benefits with respect to sheltering and anchorage. The responses of M. aquatica that may result in a denser canopy and enhancement of anchorage efficiency could lead to a resistance strategy.

AB 1. Unpredictable, extreme climatic events (e.g. droughts) can potentially destabilize aquatic communities. From 1998 to 2002, southwestern Georgia, U.S.A., experienced the third worst drought of the last 100 years, leading to loss of surface flow in many small streams. We sampled macroinvertebrates, flow and water chemistry in small headwater streams from 2001 to 2007 in two adjacent coastal plain streams of contrasting headwater type (wetland and groundwater-fed seep) following resumption of flow.
   2. Decreasing water temperature, conductivity and nutrient concentrations within the first 2 years of the study indicated flushing of the streambed associated with increased discharge. Invertebrate community composition became less variable over time and during wetter years, reflecting water chemistry, hydrological and climate conditions.
   3. A core set of species appeared immediately following breaking of the drought in both streams, reflecting a shared species pool. These species exhibited resilience traits, including short life cycles and resistance to desiccation, which allowed for rapid recovery from disturbance. Such species, which were small-bodied, sclerotized and abundant in the drift, were then replaced as flows increased by those that were larger, soft-bodied and rare in drift, suggesting a more stable and less ephemeral habitat.
   4. Hydrologic regime and long-term precipitation indices were strongly correlated with invertebrate community and trait structure. Long-term data allowed for better interpretation of the effects of infrequent disturbances on aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, long-term precipitation indices (i.e. 48-month standardized precipitation index) can indicate the likelihood of a return to drought, allowing for the collection of pre-disturbance data.

AB The predictive power of the current risk-assessment framework for pesticides remains uncertain. This is because any extrapolation towards landscape-level effects encounters considerable uncertainties: (i) when proceeding from the level of individual single-species tests to populations and communities, biological interactions are not considered; (ii) from mesocosms to field communities, environmental factors and stressors that determine the effects of pesticides in the field are not considered; and (iii) most monitoring investigations are restricted spatially and do not consider recolonisation, and lack an adequate means of distinguishing confounding factors from natural variation. We advocate using species traits as community descriptors, to determine quantitative links between pesticide toxicity and community alterations. Recently, a trait-based indicator system was developed to identify SPEcies At Risk (SPEAR) of being affected by pesticides, with reference to life-history and physiological traits. This SPEAR system has now been successfully employed to link pesticide exposure and effects in Finland, France and Germany. The effect of pesticides on the structure of communities described with SPEAR was independent of the biogeographical region. We then extrapolated and visualised the anticipated risk for aquatic communities in small agricultural streams within Europe in a risk map. With this information we identified a potential risk from pesticide runoff in a high proportion of streams. By focusing on the ecological effect of selected environmental factors, trait-based approaches offer an increased realism for risk assessment of toxicants on the ecosystem level.

AB A number of indices designed to assess ecosystem function were applied to an existing benthic macrofaunal dataset collected following recent marine aggregate extraction activity at the Hastings Shingle Bank (UK). The objective of the study was to assess the use of these different functional metrics, some incorporating to investigate the rate of recovery in ecosystem function after dredging impact. All biological traits analysis, of the indices tested behaved in a broadly similar fashion following the aggregate extraction event, although some suggested faster rates of functional recovery than others. All indicated that the disturbed area of seabed was capable of full recovery given enough time. It is considered that this outcome may be because the physical nature of the seabed was unlikely to have been permanently altered by dredging for aggregate by the method used. This is not always the case following aggregate extraction and depends on the dredging protocol used (e.g., sediment screening). The indices tested (some applied for the first time to benthic macrofaunal data) were considered to be complementary to traditional environmental assessment metrics and each might be used under different circumstances.

AB The expectation that long-term, broad-scale changes in the relative abundance of species, homogenisation of habitats and decreases in diversity will affect ecosystem function has led to an increasing number of studies on functional diversity and composition. Such studies frequently consider the effect of environmental gradients and anthropogenic impacts, but rarely the effect of biogenic habitat variation. In marine soft-sediment systems, habitat variability is likely to be of particular importance because of the strong link between habitat and species diversity. In this study we examine the link between functional trait diversity (as richness and evenness) and composition, and habitat variation in two locations with different regional species pools. We found similar functional traits occurring in the two locations, but differences between habitats within the locations. High evenness within traits was apparent (across both locations and habitats) reflecting the potential for the maintenance of function with the loss of individual species. Between-habitat differences in functional traits were driven by differences in organism densities rather than the presence/absence of individual traits, emphasising the importance of density shifts in driving function. Furthermore, our demonstration of habitat variation as a driver of functional composition and diversity suggests that habitat heterogeneity should be explicitly included within studies trying to predict the effect of species loss on ecosystem function.

AB Indices are used to quantify change in the environment by reducing aspects of environmental complexity to numbers. Biodiversity indices are typically calculated using the numbers of species and their relative abundances. A recent advance has been the development of additional measures of diversity, such as phylogenetic diversity, based on relationships between organisms. The emerging paradigms of the importance of biodiversity to ecosystem services and the ecosystem approach to fishery management could be well served by the development of indicators of ecosystem functioning. We discuss how relatedness measures may be adapted to quantify aspects of community structure of relevance to ecosystem functioning, by combining information on species' occurrence, life history, and ecological traits. We present an index that reflects average functional distinctness within assemblages. We illustrate the approach using North Sea fish. Results reveal that average functional distinctness is not independent of taxonomic distinctness. This is expected, but the weakness of the relationship suggests that both indices may prove useful, because they are not constrained to convey the same information about samples. Both indices are shown to be weakly related to species richness, which was not expected. This is a consequence of differences in the frequencies of occurrence among species.

AB A tongue-bite apparatus (TBA) governs raking behaviors in two major and unrelated teleost lineages, the osteoglossomorph and salmoniform fishes. We present data on comparative morphology and kinematics from two representative species, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the Australian arowana (Scleropages jardinii), which suggest that both the TBA and raking are convergently derived in these lineages. Similar TBA morphologies were present, except for differences in TBA dentition and shape of the novel cleithrobranchial ligament (CBL), which is arc-shaped in O. mykiss and straight in S. jardinii. Eight kinematic variables were used to quantify motion magnitude and maximum-timing in the kinematic input mechanisms of the TBA. Five variables differed inter-specifically (pectoral girdle retraction magnitude and timing, cranial and hyoid elevation and gape-distance timing), yet an incomplete taxon separation across multivariate kinematic space demonstrated an overall similarity in raking behavior. An outgroup analysis using bowfin (Amia calva) and pickerel (Esox americanus) to compare kinematics of raking with chewing and prey-capture provided robust quantitative evidence of raking being a convergently derived behavior. Support was also found for the notion that raking more likely evolved from the strike, a functionally distinct behavior, than from chewing, an alternative prey-processing behavior. Based on raking kinematic and muscle-activity data, we propose biomechanical models of the three input mechanisms that govern kinematics of the basihyal output mechanism during the raking power stroke: (1) cranial elevation protracts the upper TBA jaw from the lower (basihyal) TBA jaw; (2) basihyal retraction is caused directly by contraction of the sternohyoideus (SH); (3) hypaxial shortening, relayed via the pectoral girdle and SH-CBL complex, is an indirect basihyal retraction mechanism modeled as a four-bar linkage. These models will aid future analyses mapping structural and functional traits to the evolution of behaviors.

AB Living rodents show great diversity in their locomotor habits, including semiaquatic, arboreal, fossorial, ricochetal, and gliding species from multiple families. To assess the association between limb morphology and locomotor habits, the appendicular skeletons tons of 65 rodent genera from 16 families were measured. Ecomorphological analyses of various locomotor types revealed consistent differences in postcranial skeletal morphology that relate to functionally important traits. Behaviorally similar taxa showed convergent morphological characters, despite distinct evolutionary histories. Semiaquatic rodents displayed relatively robust bones, enlarged muscular attachments, short femora, and elongate hind feet. Arboreal rodents had relatively elongate humeri and digits, short olecranon processes of the ulnae, and equally proportioned fore and hind limbs. Fossorial rodents showed relatively robust bones, enlarged muscular attachments, short antebrachii and digits, elongate manual claws, and reduced hind limb elements. Ricochetal rodents displayed relatively proximal insertion of muscles, disproportionate limbs, elongate tibiae, and elongate hind feet. Gliding rodents had relatively elongate and gracile bones, short olecranon processes of the ulnae and equally proportioned fore and hind limbs. The morphological differences observed here can readily be used to discriminate extant rodents with different locomotor strategies. This suggests that the method could be applied to extinct rodents, regardless of ancestry, to accurately infer their locomotor ecologies. When applied to an extinct group of rodents, we found two distinct ecomorphs represented in the beaver family (Castoridae), semiaquatic and semifossorial. There was also a progressive trend toward increased body size and increased aquatic specialization in the giant beaver lineage (Castoroidinae). J. Morphol. 269:1387-1411, 2008.

AB Information from lizard lineages that have evolved a highly elongate (snake-like) body form may clarify the selective forces important in the early evolution of snakes. Lizards have evolved bodily elongation via two distinct routes: as an adaptation to burrowing underground or to rapid locomotion above ground. These two routes involve diametrically opposite modifications to the body plan. Burrowing lizards have elongate trunks, small heads, short tails, and relatively constant body widths, whereas surface-active taxa typically have shorter trunks, wider heads, longer tails, and more variable body widths. Snakes resemble burrowing rather than surface-active (or aquatic) lizards in these respects, suggesting that snakes evolved from burrowing lizards. The trunk elongation of burrowing lizards increases the volume of the alimentary tract, so that an ability to ingest large meals (albeit consisting of small individual prey items) was present in the earliest snakes. Subsequent shifts to ingestion of wide-bodied prey came later, after selection dismantled other gape-constraining morphological attributes, some of which may also have arisen as adaptations to burrowing through hard soil (e.g. relatively small heads, rigid skulls). Adaptations of snake skulls to facilitate ingestion of large prey have evolved to compensate for the reduction of relative head size accompanying bodily elongation; relative to predator body mass, maximum sizes of prey taken by snakes may not be much larger than those of many lizards. This adaptive scenario suggests novel functional links between traits, and a series of testable predictions about the relationships between squamate morphology, habitat, and trophic ecology.

AB We describe dramatic shifts in the species composition of the marine fish community of the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a 35-year time series of catch rates in an annual bottom-trawl survey. We attempt to understand the causes of these changes using a traits-based approach that relates the similarity among species in their abundance trends to similarities in their ecological traits. We selected traits based on a priori beliefs of how each should reflect susceptibility to changes in a different external factor potentially affecting the community. We found evidence for an effect of ocean climate and top-down effects of fishing and seal predation, but not for bottom-up effects of prey availability on adult fishes. Mean body length in the community decreased dramatically in the 1990s. This reflected the removal of large-bodied fishes by fishing and sharp increases in the abundance of small fishes. The biomass of small fish was inversely correlated with an index of predation on those fish by larger fish, suggesting strong predator control of the abundance of small-bodied fishes. Our results suggest that changes in ocean climate combined with direct and indirect effects of harvesting can dramatically and rapidly alter the composition of marine fish communities.

AB 1. Invertebrates and aquatic plants often play a key role in biogeochemical processes occurring at the water-sediment interface of aquatic ecosystems. However, few studies have investigated the respective influences of plants and bioturbating animals on ecological processes (nutrient fluxes, benthic oxygen uptake, microbial activities) occurring in freshwater sediments.
   2. We developed a laboratory experiment in aquaria to quantify the effects of (i) one invertebrate acting as a bioturbator (Tubifex tubifex); (ii) one submersed plant with a high sediment-oxygenating potential (Myriophyllum spicatum) and (iii) one submersed plant with a low sediment-oxygenating potential (Elodea canadensis).
   3. The tubificid worms significantly increased the fluxes of nitrogen at the water-sediment interface (influx of nitrate, efflux of ammonium), whereas the two plant species did not have significant influences on these nitrogen fluxes. The differences in nitrogen fluxes between tubificid worms and plants were probably due to the bioirrigation process caused by T. tubifex, which increased water exchanges at the water-sediment interface. Tubifex tubifex and M. spicatum produced comparable reductions of nutrient concentrations in pore water and comparable stimulations of benthic oxygen uptake and microbial communities (percentages of active eubacteria and hydrolytic activity) whereas E. canadensis had a very weak influence on these variables. These differences between the two plants were due to their contrasting abilities to increase oxygen in sediments by radial oxygen losses (release of oxygen from roots).
   4. Our study suggests that the bioirrigation process and radial oxygen loss are major functional traits affecting biogeochemical functioning at the water-sediment interface of wetlands.

AB The marine spionid polychaete, Streblospio benedicti, is poecilogonous, a single species that produces two different larval types, obligate planktotrophic and facultative planktotrophic. This study compares the early cleavage of both forms of S. benedicti to that of a recently described (Rice and Levin 1998), closely related species, Streblospio gynobranchiata, which exhibits obligate planktotrophic development. Embryos were evaluated for blastomere and polar lobe size and the rate of the first four cleavages. All three Streblospio populations possessed large polar lobes and the 2d cell was equal to if not larger than the 2D cell; thus, these cleavage traits are likely selectively conserved because of their functional importance. Although there were significant differences between S. benedicti obligate planktotrophs and facultative planktotrophs, the S. benedicti and S. gynobranchiata obligate planktotrophic populations were identical in all respects. For example, embryos of both obligate planktotrophs formed equal-sized 1c and 1d micromeres that were larger than the 1a and 1b micromeres, while the facultative planktotrophs had equal-sized first quartet micromeres. The identical cleavage pattern of the two obligate planktotrophic Streblospio populations indicates that some early developmental patterns reflect larval developmental needs and not adult differences. The embryological differences between the two Streblospio obligate planktotrophs and the S. benedicti facultative planktotroph were unexpected as the former appeared to be more derived. This study has shown that the Streblospio genus, and its one poecilogonous species, serve as an excellent model system for studying the role of early developmental events in changes to tropic mode and, potentially, the creation of a new species.

AB Plant adaptations to the environment are limited, and therefore plants in similar environments may display similar functional and physiological traits, a pattern termed functional convergence. Evidence was examined for functional convergence among 28 evergreen woody shrubs from three plant communities of the semi-arid winter rainfall region of southern California.
   Both leaf and water relations traits were examined, including seasonal stomatal conductance (g(s)), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf specific conductivity (K(l)), seasonal water potential (Psi(w)), stem cavitation resistance (Psi(50)), and xylem density.
   Species display community-specific suites of xylem and leaf traits consistent with different patterns of water use among communities, with coastal sage scrub species utilizing shallow pulses of water, Mojave Desert scrub species relying on deeper water reserves, and chaparral species utilizing both shallow and deep moisture reserves. Communities displayed similar degrees of water stress, with a community-level minimum Psi(w) (Psi(wmin)) of c. -4.6 Mpa, similar to other and communities. Pooled across sites, there was a strong correlation between Psi(wmin) and xylem density, suggesting that these traits are broadly related and predictive of one another.
   This comparative community physiology approach may be useful in testing hypotheses of functional convergence across structurally similar semi-arid communities.

AB Marine-terrestrial resource flows can subsidies recipient consumers at various trophic levels. Theory suggests that the importance of such spatial subsidies depends on the productivity gradient between adjacent systems; however, the empirical data required to test this assumption are scarce. Most studies of marine-terrestrial subsidies have been performed in arid coastal habitats of low productivity surrounded by productive ocean waters. We examined the importance of marine resource inputs for terrestrial consumers on a temperate, productive forest island surrounded by a marine system of similar productivity. The importance of marine resources for the dominant arthropod consumers was estimated using stable isotopes and linear mixing models. We compared isotopic signatures of spiders and ants captured along a gradient from shore to inland to estimate how far marine-derived energy penetrates the island. We evaluated the distribution of ground-dwelling arthropods using pitfall-trap transects extending from the supratidal-forest boundary to the middle of the island. The contribution of marine-derived energy assimilated by arthropod consumers differed both among taxa and location. Marine-derived resources contributed > 80% to the assimilated C of intertidal spiders and 5-10% for spiders at the forest edge and further inland. Ants assimilated 20% of their C from marine-derived resources and this proportion was not affected by distance from shore. Spiders, ants, and all arthropods combined exhibited no spatial aggregation towards the shore. Our results indicate that on temperate islands marine-terrestrial subsidies might be predominantly an edge effect, confined to intertidal consumers. Mobile consumers that opportunistically forage in intertidal habitats play an important role in transferring marine-derived energy further inland. This suggests that the importance of the productivity gradient for spatial subsidies can be modified by the mobility traits of the recipient consumers and their degree of specialization on the interface habitat.

AB Single-trial and across-trial spatial analyses using autoregressive error structures were conducted for growth traits based on 1,146 data sets from 275 Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] progeny trials in 45 first-generation breeding zones in the US Pacific Northwest. The breeding zones encompassed a wide range of latitude, longitude, and elevation. Efficiency of using spatial analysis in reducing variation due to site heterogeneity, estimating genetic parameters, and increasing prediction accuracy was compared among different experimental designs, traits, assessment ages, and tree spacings. More than 97% of the data sets showed significant model improvement with spatial analysis, and height showed more improvement than diameter or volume. Spatial analysis on average removed 14 similar to 34% of residual variance due to spatial heterogeneity, which resulted in an up to 20% increase in accuracy of breeding value prediction. The coefficient of variation decreased substantially due to spatial adjustment. Rank correlation between predicted gains before and after spatial analysis was about 0.96, and spatial analysis had little effect on the average predicted gain of the top 20% of parents. We did not observe substantial geographic trends in improvements due to spatial adjustment. Across-site spatial analysis had almost no effect on genotype-by-environment interaction but tended to increase among-trial heterogeneity of residual variance. Two different methods for across-trial spatial analysis were compared and discussed.

AB 1. Effective environmental management requires a sound understanding of the causal mechanisms underlying the relationship of species with their environment. Mechanistic explanations linking species and environment are ultimately based on species traits. Many tools for ecological assessment and biomonitoring lack such explanations. Elsewhere, we have defined life-history strategies, based on the interrelations between species traits and their functional implications.
   2. This study tests the hypothesis that life-history strategies represent different solutions to particular ecological problems, thus connecting species and their environment through species traits. Data on aquatic macroinvertebrates in a variety of waterbodies were analysed in terms of life-history strategies. These waterbodies differed in environmental conditions and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Solutions to the ecological problems present in each type of water body were expected to be reflected in the abundance of (species exhibiting) different life-history strategies.
   3. Results show clear differences in strategy composition between the different water types, which could be related to the prevailing environmental conditions through mechanistic explanations. For example, species with a long period of juvenile development and a synchronized emergence of short-lived adults were most dominant in large mesotrophic waterbodies with stable and predictable environmental conditions. In contrast, species that have a rapid development and spread successive reproduction attempts over a longer time period were most abundant in waterbodies with fluctuating and less predictable environmental conditions.
   4. Differences in strategy composition provide insight into the prevailing environmental conditions related to temporal predictability, and habitat favourability, from the perspective of the species themselves. By reducing diverse species assemblages to a small number of strategies, representing easily interpretable relationships, this approach may be useful in environmental quality assessment programmes, including those required by the European Water Framework Directive. Based on mechanistic explanations, life-history strategies may generate testable predictions and guide future research. Further research may focus on expanding life-history strategies to include other species groups and ecosystems.

AB Aim A major question with regard to the ecology of temperate rain forests in south-central Chile is how pioneer and shade-tolerant tree species coexist in old-growth forests. We explored the correspondence between tree regeneration dynamics and life-history traits to explain the coexistence of these two functional types in stands apparently representing a non-equilibrium mixture.
   Location This study was conducted in northern Chiloe Island, Chile (41.6 degrees S, 73.9 degrees W) in a temperate coastal rain forest with no evidence of stand disruption by human impact.
   Methods We assessed stand structure by sampling all stems within two 50 x 20 m and four 5 x 100 m plots. A 600-m long transect, with 20 uniformly spaced sampling points, was used to quantify seedling and sapling densities, obtain increment cores, and randomly select 10 tree-fall gaps. We used tree-ring analysis to assess establishment periods and to relate the influences of disturbances to the regeneration dynamics of the main canopy species.
   Results Canopy emergent tree species were the long-lived pioneer Eucryphia cordifolia and the shade-tolerant Aextoxicon punctatum. Shade-tolerant species such as Laureliopsis philippiana and several species of Myrtaceae occupied the main canopy. The stem diameter distribution for E. cordifolia was distinctly unimodal, while for A. punctatum it was multi-modal, with all age classes represented. Myrtaceae accounted for most of the small trees. Most tree seedlings and saplings occurred beneath canopy gaps. Based on tree-ring counts, the largest individuals of A. punctatum and E. cordifolia had minimum ages estimated to be > 350 years and > 286 years, respectively. Shade-tolerant Myrtaceae species and L. philippiana had shorter life spans (< 200 years). Most growth releases, regardless of tree species, were moderate and have occurred continuously since 1750.
   Main conclusions We suggest that this coastal forest has remained largely free of stand-disrupting disturbances for at least 450 years, without substantial changes in canopy composition. Release patterns are consistent with this hypothesis and suggest that the disturbance regime is dominated by individual tree-fall gaps, with sporadic multiple tree falls. Long life spans, maximum height and differences in shade tolerance provide a basis for understanding the long-term coexistence of pioneer and shade-tolerant tree species in this coastal, old-growth rain forest, despite the rarity of major disturbances.

AB 1. The extent to which conservation of biodiversity enforces the protection of ecosystem functioning. goods and services is a key issue in conservation ecology.
   2. In order to address this conservation issue. this work focused on community organization, linking community structure, as described both in taxonomic and functional terms, to community functioning and ecosystem process.
   3. Body size is an individual functional trait that is deterministically related to components of ecosystem functioning such as population dynamics and energy flow, and which determines components of community structure. Since body size is an individual trait that reflects numerous factors, it is also exposed to trait selection and the niche filtering underlying the community.
   4. An analysis of the relevance of body size to community organization in transitional water ecosystems in the eastern Mediterranean adn Black Sea regions is presented, based on field research conducted on a sample of 15 transitional water ecosystems.
   5. 250 taxa were identified, clumped in five orders of magnitude of body size. All bodt size patterns showed triangular distributions with an optimal size range of 0.13 mg to 1.0 mg individual body mass.
   6. Deterministic components of size structure were emphasized and a hierarchical organization with dominance of large sizes was demonstrated by the slopes of the body size-abundance distributions, consistently larger than the EER threshold (b=-0.75), and by the direct relationship of energy use to body size for most of the body size range.
   7. Consistent variations of body size-related descriptors were observed on three main gradients of environmental stress; cultrophication, cofinement and metal pollution.
   8. The results support the relevance of constraints imposed by individual body size on community organization in transitional water ecosystems and the adequacy of size patterns as an indicator for ecological conservation of these fragile ecosystems. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Regardless of the morphological divergence among larval forms of marine bryozoans, file larval nervous system and its major effector organs (Musculature and ciliary fields) are largely molded on the basis Of functional demands of feeding, ciliary propulsion, phototactic behaviors, and substrate exploration. Previously published ultrastructural information and immunohistochemical reconstructions presented here indicate that neuronal pathways are largely ipsilateral, with more complex synaptic connections localized within the nerve nodule. Multiciliated sensory-motor neurons diversify structurally and functionally oil the basis of their position along the axis of swimming largely due to the functional demands of photoklinotaxis and substrate exploration. Vesiculariform, buguliform, and ascophoran coronate larvae all have patches of sensory neurons bordering the pyriform organ's ciliated groove (juxtapapillary cells and border cells) that are active during substrate selection. Despite their simplified form, cyclostome larvae maintain swimming and probing behaviors with sensory-motor systems functionally similar to those of some parenchymella and planula larval types. Considering the evolutionary relationships among the morphological grades of marine bryozoans, particular lineages within the gymnolaemates have independently evolved larval traits that convey a greater range of sensory abilities and increased propulsive capacity. The larval nervous system of bryozoans may be evolutionarily derived from the pretrochal region of a trochophore-like larval form.

AB In marine bivalves, the relative sizes of the gills and palps appear to be a useful functional trait that reflect feeding mode, i.e. suspension feeders have relatively larger gills than palps for pumping, whereas deposit feeders have relatively larger palps than gills for sorting. Also, within a species, the relative sizes of the gills and palps are related to changes in local food conditions. However, there is still no firm evidence showing that differences in the relative gill and palp sizes between species are related to diet selection. Based on the knowledge that carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures of an animals tissues reflect past diet, we compared the relative gill and palp sizes of bivalves from Roebuck Bay, northwestern Australia with their carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures. The carbon isotope signatures distinguished clear differences in diet between bivalves along a gradient from suspension to deposit feeding, and strikingly this pattern was closely followed by the relative sizes of the gills and palps of the bivalves. This study confirms that relative gill and palp sizes in bivalves are a functional trait that can be used to compare resource use between species. Furthermore, these data may suggest that morphospace occupation, as determined by relative gill and palp sizes of bivalves, could reflect a gradient of resource use between species.

AB Eyespots have long been thought to confer protection against predators, but empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of these markings and their survival value in the wild is limited. Using a mark-recapture experiment, I examined the functional significance of the eyespot on the dorsal fin of a juvenile tropical fish to its survival on coral reefs. None of the juveniles recaptured 1 month after settlement showed evidence of bite marks on the posterior region of the bodies to suggest a deflective function of their eyespot. When I compared the survivors with recruits from the same settlement cohort, I detected no change in the frequency distribution of eyespot size, suggesting no selective pressure operating on this trait. I compared these survivors with conspecifics from the same cohort collected at settlement and then outgrown in the absence of predators under 3 food regimes and 2 levels of intraspecific competition. I found that the eyespots of wild juveniles were larger overall than those of conspecifics maintained in a predator-free environment. The results of this study indicate that larger eyespots per se do not confer a survival advantage in the wild, suggesting that eyespots of this species may not have the long-assumed antipredatory function but play a role in interactions with adult conspecifics. I suggest that juveniles maintain eyespots even when predators or adult conspecifics are absent because they can be afforded at very low costs and may still be beneficial to their bearer under specific ecological conditions.

AB In disturbed habitats, vegetative regeneration is partly ruled by plant reserves and intrinsic growth rates. Under nutrient-limiting conditions, perennial plants tend to exhibit an increased allocation to storage organs. Under mechanically stressful conditions, plants also tend to increase allocation to below-ground biomass and storage organs. We tested whether those stresses acting differently on plants (nutrient level versus mechanical forces) led to similar effect on storage organs and regeneration ability. We measured, for an aquatic plant species, (1) the size and allocation to storage organs (stems) and (2) the regeneration ability of the storage organs. Plant stems were collected in 4 habitats ranked along a nutrient stress gradient, and having encountered null versus significant mechanical stress (flowing water). All stems were placed in similar neutral conditions and left for a period of 6 weeks before measuring their survival and growth. Dry mass allocation to the storage organ (stem) was higher in stressful habitats. Moreover, stress encountered by plants before the experiment significantly affected regeneration: stems of previously stressed plants (i.e. plants that had grown in nutrient-poor or mechanically stressful habitats) survived better than unstressed ones. Stems of plants having encountered mechanical stress before the experiment had increased growth in nutrient-rich habitats but reduced growth in the poorest habitats. These results demonstrate that regeneration could rely on the level of stress previously encountered by plants. Stress could lead to greater regeneration ability following mechanical failure. The possible mechanisms involved in these results are discussed.

AB Marine protected areas are generally designed and managed on the basis of the presence and extent of specific habitat types or the habitats of important species. However, it has become clear that in addition to including these 'structural' elements of marine systems, management strategies should incorporate a consideration of the functional aspects of the ecosystems. Biological traits analysis (BTA) has been successfully used to describe ecological functioning in marine benthic systems. BTA uses a number of biological characteristics expressed by the taxa present as indicators of key ecosystem functions. Two expert workshops were used to examine the potential for the application of BTA in the designation and management of MPAs. They concluded that BTA represented the best tool currently available for quantifying ecological functioning and agreed on 10-key ecological functions delivered by marine benthic communities. Twenty-four biological traits were also identified by the workshops as indices of these ten functions. In order to demonstrate the practical utility of the approach, BTA using these traits, was applied to a dataset covering benthos from within and around the proposed Eddystone Special Area of Conservation (SW England). The case study demonstrated that with the type of data normally available from conservation assessment type surveys, and a knowledge of the relevant biological traits, it is possible to use a consideration of ecological functioning to set boundaries for the MPA and to inform the site management objectives. The use of structure and function information to inform the designation process and subsequent management of marine protected areas is discussed.

AB The Neotropical seven-spined gobies (tribe Gobiosomatini), including the Gobiosoma and Microgobius groups, constitute a speciose, monophyletic gobiid taxon. In particular, member species of the Gobiosoma group exhibit a combination of behavioral diversification and microhabitat specialization that may have played a major role in their collective rapid evolution and high rate of speciation. Functional hermaphroditism, which is common among gobiids, can promote exploitation of patchily distributed micro-niches by countering potential reductions in reproductive opportunities. However, the possible role of functional hermaphroditism in the exploitation of microhabitats and rapid speciation in the Gobiosoma group is unknown. One member species, Tigrigobius multifasciatus, is a functional hermaphrodite. Two other Gobiosoma group species are functionally gonochoric (i.e., constant-sexed), but exhibit transient hermaphroditic ovarian structure among immatures. In this study, ovarian morphology among immature and adult females of several Gobiosoma group species was examined to see if hermaphroditic gonadal features are present. Although no evidence of functional hermaphroditism in the form of precursive accessory gonadal structures (pAGS) associated with the adult ovary was found among newly examined species, all species exhibited the transient expression of hermaphroditic gonadal features associated with the immature ovary. In contrast, among six species of non-Gobiosomatini genera having no record of hermaphroditism, none exhibited similar transient hermaphroditic features associated with the immature ovary. These findings suggest that hermaphroditism may have been an ancestral trait which has been secondarily lost within some Gobiosoma group species. This study also shows that ontogenetic and morphogenic processes within the gobiid reproductive system may provide new insights into the evolution of life history traits and significantly further our understanding of the extraordinary evolutionary success of this group.

AB Despite the wide range of locomotor adaptations in birds, little detailed attention has been given to the relationships between the quantitative structural characteristics of avian limb bones and bird behaviour. Possible differences in forelimb relative to hindlimb strength across species have been especially neglected. We generated cross-sectional, geometric data from peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans of the humerus and femur of 127 avian skeletons, representing 15 species of extant birds in 13 families. The sample includes terrestrial runners, arboreal perchers, hindlimb-propelled divers, forelimb-propelled divers and dynamic soarers. The hindlimb-propelled diving class includes a recently flightless island form. Our results demonstrate that locomotor dynamics can be differentiated in most cases based on cross-sectional properties, and that structural proportions are often more informative than bone length proportions for determining behaviour and locomotion. Recently flightless forms, for example, are more easily distinguished using structural ratios than using length ratios. A proper phylogenetic context is important for correctly interpreting structural characteristics, especially for recently flightless forms. Some of the most extreme adaptations to mechanical loading are seen in aquatic forms. Penguins have forelimbs adapted to very high loads. Aquatic species differ from non-aquatic species on the basis of relative cortical thickness. The combination of bone structural strength and relative cortical area of the humerus successfully differentiates all of our locomotor groups. The methods used in this study are highly applicable to fossil taxa, for which morphology is known but behaviour is not. The use of bone structural characteristics is particularly useful in palaeontology not only because it generates strong signals for many locomotor guilds, but also because analysing such traits does not require knowledge of body mass, which can be difficult to estimate reliably for fossil taxa.

AB We used a phylogenetically based comparative approach to evaluate the potential for physiological studies to reveal patterns of diversity in traits related to susceptibility to an environmental stressor, the trace metal cadmium (Cd). Physiological traits related to Cd bioaccumulation, compartmentalization, and ultimately susceptibility were measured in 21 aquatic insect species representing the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera. We mapped these experimentally derived physiological traits onto a phylogeny and quantified the tendency for related species to be similar (phylogenetic signal). All traits related to Cd bioaccumulation and susceptibility exhibited statistically significant phylogenetic signal, although the signal strength varied among traits. Conventional and phylogenetically based regression models were compared, revealing great variability within orders but consistent, strong differences among insect families. Uptake and elimination rate constants were positively correlated among species, but only when effects of body size and phylogeny were incorporated in the analysis. Together, uptake and elimination rates predicted dramatic Cd bioaccumulation differences among species that agreed with field-based measurements. We discovered a potential tradeoff, between the ability to eliminate Cd and the ability to detoxify it across species, particularly mayflies. The best-fit regression models were driven by phylogenetic parameters (especially differences among families) rather than functional traits, suggesting that it may eventually be possible to predict a taxon's physiological performance based on its phylogenetic position, provided adequate physiological information is available for close relatives. There appears to be great potential for evolutionary physiological approaches to augment our understanding of insect responses to environmental stressors in nature.

AB Changes in biodiversity may disrupt the ecological functions performed by species assemblages. Hence, we urgently need to examine the implications of biodiversity loss not only in terms of species conservation but also in terms of sustainability of ecosystem services. The ability of protected areas to maintain local species richness has been clearly demonstrated. However, preserving goods and services provided by ecosystems requires not only the conservation of species richness but also the conservation of the most 'original' species, i.e. the ones with the highest average rarity of their attributes which are likely to perform some unique functions in ecosystems. We proposed a new conservation of biological originality (CBO) index as well as associated randomization tests to quantify the ability of piotected areas to maintain viable populations for the most original species. As an application, we used long-term fisheries data collected in the Bonifacio Strait Natural Reserve (BSNR) to determine the species which benefited from the protection reinforcement in 1999. We also estimated a set of 14 ecomorphological functional traits on the 37 fish species caught in the BSNR and we obtained a functional originality value for each species. As a result, we found that functional originality was significantly protected in the fish assemblage of the BSNR: species with the most original functional trait combinations became more abundant after 1999. Our finding suggests that protecting most original species is an insurance against functional diversity erosion in the BSNR. More generally, our new index can be used to test whether protected areas may protect preferentially the most original species and whether restorative management promotes the reestablishment of the most original species with particular habitat requirements.

AB Relations between tissue trace element concentrations and species traits were examined for 45 fish species to determine the extent to which trait-based characteristics accounted for relative differences among species in trace element bioaccumulation. Percentages of fish species correctly classified by discriminant analysis according to traits predicted by tissue trace element concentrations ranged from 72% to 87%. Tissue concentrations of copper, mercury, selenium, and zinc appeared to have the greatest overall influence on differentiating species according to trait characteristics. Discrimination of trait characteristics did not appear to be strongly influenced by local sources of trace elements in the streambed sediment. Bioaccumulation was greatest for those species classified as primarily detritivores, having relatively large adult body size, considered nonmigratory with respect to reproductive strategy, occurring mostly in large or variable size streams and rivers, preferring depositional areas within the stream channel, and preferring benthic rather than open-water habitats. Our findings provide evidence of the strong relationship between bioaccumulation of environmental trace elements and trait-based factors that influence contaminant exposure.

AB The soft-bottom communities of eight Italian lagoons were analyzed for eight biological traits (feeding, mobility, adult life habitat, body size, life span, reproductive technique, type of larva and reproductive frequency) in order to identify the dominant traits in different transitional environments. We considered the ecological quality status (EcoQS) of the stations, assessed by two biotic indices, AMBI and Bentix. Stations were categorized into EcoQS classes to investigate the relationship between biological functions and ecological quality. The results indicate that the variability of the data was governed by traits linked to resource utilization rather than to life cycle. Lagoons affected by chronic disturbance displayed a poor functional composition, which usually corresponded to poor EcoQS in some cases, correlations between ecological groups and traits modalities were ecologically relevant; however, classes of EcoQS were found to be relatively independent from the functional structure of the considered stations.

AB The relationships between functional linkages within communities and community dynamics are fundamental to biodiversity-stability relationships. By teasing apart the hidden layers within artificial neural networks (ANNs), we developed webs defining how functional groups influence each other's temporal dynamics. ANNs were based on 15 years of bimonthly monitoring of macrobenthic communities on three intertidal sandflats in Manukau Harbor ( New Zealand). Sites differed in web topology and diversity, with the site dominated by one functional group exhibiting only a few strong links, the lowest alpha-, beta-, and gamma- diversity, and the highest temporal stability in alpha-diversity. However, positive interactions between functional groups, nonconcordant with harborwide or sitespecific environmental variables, always dominated the interaction webs. The increased number of links we observed with increased temporal variation of species richness within functional groups and overall diversity supports the insurance hypothesis. While our findings suggest that there may be no consistent model characterizing the topology of temporal interactions between functional groups, decreasing diversity is likely to decouple interactions between functional groups and decrease ecosystem functionality.

AB Background: Exploiting synteny between mouse and human disease loci has been proposed as a cost-effective method for the identification of human susceptibility genes. Here we explore its utility in an analysis of a human personality trait, neuroticism, which can be modeled in mice by tests of emotionality. We investigated a mouse emotionality locus on chromosome I that contains no annotated genes but abuts four regulators of G protein signaling, one of which (rgs2) has been previously identified as a quantitative trait gene for emotionality. This locus is syntenic with a human region that has been consistently implicated in the genetic aetiology of neuroticism.
   Methods: The functional candidacy of 29 murine sequence variants was tested by a combination of gel shift and transient transfection assays. Marine sequences that contained functional variants and exhibited significant cross-species conservation were prioritized for investigation in humans. Genetic association with neuroticism was tested in 1869 high and 2032 low unrelated individuals scored for neuroticism, selected from the extremes of 88,141 people from southwest England.
   Results: Fifteen sequence variants contributed to variation in the expression of rgs 18, the gene lying at the edge of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) interval. There was no evidence of association between neuroticism and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lying in the human regions homologous to those of mouse functional variants. One SNP, rs6428058, in a region of sequence conservation 644 kb upstream of RGS18, showed significant association (p =.000631).
   Conclusions: It is unlikely that a single variant is responsible for the mouse emotionality locus on chromosome 1. This level of underlying genetic complexity means that although cross-species QTL concordance maybe invaluable for the identification of human disease loci, it is unlikely to be as informative in the identification of human disease-causing variants.

AB Historically, small invertebrate grazers in marine plant communities have been considered to be a relatively homogeneous group in their impact on ecosystem processes. However, recent studies propose that species composition is an important agent in determining grazer effects. We used four mesocosm experiments to test the biomass-specific and density-dependent effects of common mesograzers in temperate regions (Littorina littorea, Rissoa membranacea, Idotea baltica and Gammarus oceanicus) on epiphyte and eelgrass biomass and productivity. Mesograzer species identity strongly influenced epiphyte accumulation and eelgrass growth, where Rissoa was the most efficient mesograzer (per biomass) and Gammarus had the weakest impact. Density-dependent effects varied considerably among species. Both gastropod species reduced epiphyte accumulation in direct proportion to their density, and Littorina had the strongest negative effect on epiphyte biomass. The impact of Idotea seemed to level off to a threshold value and Gammarus had no density-dependent effect on epiphyte accumulation at all. Rissoa and Idotea increased eelgrass productivity in accordance with their effect on epiphyte accumulation, whereas Littorina showed a less positive effect than could be expected by its strong impact on epiphyte biomass. Gammarus had no significant impact on eelgrass growth. Our results show that the different functional traits of superficially similar mesograzers can have important consequences for ecosystem processes in macrophyte systems.

AB The clade Talpidae consists of specialized fossorial forms, shrew-like moles and semi-aquatic desmans. As with all higher jawed vertebrates, different functional, phylogenetic and developmental constraints act on different parts of dentary influencing its shape. In order to determine whether morphological variation in the dentary was unified or dispersed into an integrated complex of structural-functional components, a morphometric analysis of the mole dentary was undertaken. The dentary was subdivided into component parts - horizonal ramus; coronoid, condylar, angular processes of the ascending ramus - and outline-based geometric morphometric methods used to quantify, compare and contrast modes of shape variation within the clade. These were successful in revealing subtle differences and aspects of shape important in distinguishing between mole genera. Closer examination of shape variation within the two fully fossorial mole clades (Talpini and Scalopini) revealed several similarities in ascending ramus shapes between genera from each clade. For example, the broad, truncated appearance of the coronoid process in the talpine genera Talpa and Parascalops was shared with the scalopine genus Scapanus. Also, the more slender, hook-shaped coronoid process of Euroscaptor and Parascaptor (Talpini) closely resembles that of Scalopus (Scalopini). Interestingly, subspecies (one from each clade) more closely resembled genera other than their own in coronoid process shape. Important distinctions in horizontal ramus shape were found to exist between the two clades, such as the extent of curvature of the ventral margin and relative depth of the horizontal ramus. Results show shape variation in this region is correlated with dental formulae and the relative sizes of the teeth. The taxonomically important dentition differences characteristic of mammals are also reflected in the horizontal ramus results. Moreover, these results suggest size may be affecting shape and the extent of variation in, for example, the coronoid and condylar processes between the semi-aquatic moles Desmana and Galemys. It is likely that the effects of morphological integration seen at this level of analysis - covariation between shapes of dentary components - may exist because interacting traits are evolving together. Horizontal ramus and coronoid process shape, for example, are similar across Scapanus and Parascalops, but both these shapes have diverged in Scalopus.

AB Question: Does grazing by large herbivores affect species composition or community-wide variation in plant functional traits?
   Location: Dune grasslands at the Belgian coast.
   Methods: Plant cover and soil data were collected in 146 plots that were randomly selected at 26 grazed and ungrazed grassland sites. Plant community composition was assessed by Detrended Correspondence Analysis and mean values of plant trait categories were calculated across the plots.
   Results: Differentiation of plant composition and community-wide plant trait characteristics was largely determined by grazing, soil acidity and their interaction. In ungrazed situations, a clear floristic distinction appears between acidic (non-calcareous) and alkaline (calcareous) grasslands. In grazed situations, these floristic differences largely disappeared, indicating that grazing results in a decrease of natural variation in species composition. At higher soil pH, a larger difference in plant community composition and community-wide plant traits was observed between grazed and ungrazed plots. In ungrazed situations, shifts in plant functional traits along the acidity gradient were observed.
   Conclusions: Grazing is responsible for shifts in plant community composition, and hence a decrease in plant diversity among grasslands at opposing acidity conditions in coastal dune grasslands. Therefore, care should be taken when introducing grazing as a system approach for nature conservation in dune grasslands as it may eliminate part of the natural variation in plant diversity along existing abiotic gradients.

AB 1. In sub-Saharan Africa, tropical forests are increasingly threatened by accelerating rates of forest conversion and degradation. In East Africa, the larger tracts of intact rainforest lie largely in protected areas surrounded by converted landscape. Thus, there is critical need to understand the functional links between large-scale land use and changes in river conditions, and the implications of park boundaries on catchment integrity.
   2. The objective of this study was to use the mosaic of heavily converted land and pristine forest created by the protection of the high-altitude rainforest in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda to explore effects of deforestation on aquatic systems and the value of forest in buffering effects of adjacent land conversion. A set of 16 sites was selected over four drainages to include four categories of deforestation: agricultural land, deforested upstream (of the park boundary), forest edge (park boundary) and forest. We predicted that forest buffer (downstream or on the edge) would moderate effects of deforestation. To address this prediction, we quantified relationships between disturbance level and both physicochemical characters and traits of the macroinvertebrate assemblages during six sampling periods (February 2003 and June 2004).
   3. Results of both principal components analysis and cluster analyses indicated differences in limnological variables among deforestation categories. PC1 described a gradient from deforested sites with poor water quality to pristine forested sites with relatively good water quality. Agricultural sites and deforested upstream sites generally had the highest turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and conductivity values and low transparency values. Forest sites and boundary site groups generally exhibited low turbidity, TDS, and conductivity values and high water transparency values. Sites also clustered according to deforestation categories; forest and forested edge sites formed a cluster independent of both agricultural land and deforested-upstream.
   4. Water transparency, water temperature, and pH were the most important factors predicting benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Sensitive invertebrate families of Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Odonata dominated forested sites with high water transparency, low water temperature, and low pH while the tolerant families of Ephemeroptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, and Coleoptera were abundant in agriculturally impacted sites with low water transparency, high water temperature, and high pH.
   5. This study provides support for the importance of riparian buffers in moderating effects of deforestation. Forest and forested edge sites were more similar in both limnological and macroinvertebrate assemblage structure than sites within or downstream from agricultural lands. If the protected area cannot encompass the catchment, the use of rivers as park boundaries may help to maintain the biological integrity of the rivers by buffering one side of the watercourse.

AB The mechanisms, ways, and traits of acclimatization of aquatic animals within and outside their historical ranges are reviewed. It is shown on the example of the upper Volga basin that formation still continues of the fauna in reservoirs that began after their impoundment during 1930s-1950s. It is also shown that Ponto-Caspian invaders and intentionally introduced Baikal amphipods play a great role in this process. The data on the traits of biological cycles of mass nonindigenous invertebrates in upper Volga reservoirs are presented. The main ecological factors facilitating expansion of new species in reservoirs are demonstrated. It is shown that the assessment of the functional role of dreissena in waterbodies should include determination of the abundance of the larvae of this species in plankton.

AB We investigated whether plasticity in growth responses to nutrients could predict invasive potential in aquatic plants by measuring the effects of nutrients on growth of eight non-invasive native and six invasive exotic aquatic plant species. Nutrients were applied at two levels, approximating those found in urbanized and relatively undisturbed catchments, respectively. To identify systematic differences between invasive and non-invasive species, we compared the growth responses (total biomass, root:shoot allocation, and photosynthetic surface area) of native species with those of related invasive species after 13 weeks growth. The results were used to seek evidence of invasive potential among four recently naturalized species. There was evidence that invasive species tend to accumulate more biomass than native species (P = 0.0788). Root:shoot allocation did not differ between native and invasive plant species, nor was allocation affected by nutrient addition. However, the photosynthetic surface area of invasive species tended to increase with nutrients, whereas it did not among native species (P = 0.0658). Of the four recently naturalized species, Hydrocleys nymphoides showed the same nutrient-related plasticity in photosynthetic area displayed by known invasive species. Cyperus papyrus showed a strong reduction in photosynthetic area with increased nutrients. H. nymphoides and C. papyrus also accumulated more biomass than their native relatives. H. nymphoides possesses both of the traits we found to be associated with invasiveness, and should thus be regarded as likely to be invasive.

AB The global feature of the completely sequenced Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 type strain chromosome is its symmetry and homogeneity. The origin and terminus of replication are located opposite to each other in the chromosome and are discerned with high signal to noise ratios by maximal oligonucleotide usage biases on the leading and lagging strand. Genomic DNA structure is rather uniform throughout the chromosome with respect to intrinsic curvature, position preference or base stacking energy. The orthologs and paralogs of A. borkumensis genes with the highest sequence homology were found in most cases among gamma-Proteobacteria, with Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa as closest relatives. A. borkumensis shares a similar oligonucleotide usage and promoter structure with the Pseudomonadales. A comparatively low number of only 18 genome islands with atypical oligonucleotide usage was detected in the A. borkumensis chromosome. The gene clusters that confer the assimilation of aliphatic hydrocarbons, are localized in two genome islands which were probably acquired from an ancestor of the Yersinia lineage, whereas the alk genes of Pseudomonas putida still exhibit the typical Alcanivorax oligonucleotide signature indicating a complex evolution of this major hydrocarbonoclastic trait.

AB Feeding kinematics, suction and hydraulic jetting capabilities of bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) were characterized during controlled feeding trials. Feeding trials were conducted both on land and in water, and allowed a choice between suction and biting, but food was also presented that could be ingested by suction alone. Four feeding phases, preparatory, jaw opening, hyoid depression and jaw closing were observed; the mean feeding cycle duration was 0.54 +/- 0.22 s, regardless of feeding mode (P > 0.05). Subjects feeding on land used biting and suction 89.3% and 10.7% of the time, respectively. Subjects feeding in water used suction and hydraulic jetting 96.3% and 3.7% of the time, respectively. No biting behavior was observed underwater. Suction feeding was characterized by a small gape (2.7 +/- 0.85 cm), small gape angle (24.4 +/- 8.13), pursing of the rostral lips to form a circular aperture, and pursing of the lateral lips to occlude lateral gape. Biting was characterized by large gape (7.3 +/- 2.2 cm), large gape angle (41.7 +/- 15.2 degrees), and lip curling to expose the teeth. An excavation behavior in which suction and hydraulic jetting were alternated was used to extract food from recessed wells. The maximum subambient and suprambient pressures recorded were 91.2 and 53.4 kPa, respectively. The inclusion of suction data for phocids broadens the principle that suction feeding kinematics is conserved among aquatic vertebrates. Furthermore, bearded seals support predictions that mouth size, fluid flow speed, and elusiveness of prey consumed are among a suite of traits that determine the specific nature of suction feeding among species.

AB Ultraviolet solar radiation (UVR) and atmospheric nutrient loads to pristine ecosystems are global climate change phenomena that simultaneously affect aquatic organisms in ways not easily predicted by single factor studies. Plankton in a high mountain lake was exposed in situ to increasing phosphorus (P) concentrations (mimicking atmospheric pulses) in absence or presence of UVR in order to identify their interactive effect on functional [primary production, organic carbon (C) release (EOC), and percentage of C released (%EOC)], growth rate, structural-physiological (algal biomass, sestonic C, P content, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and Chl a:C ratio, P cell quota, cell-specific Chl a), and stoichiometric (autotroph C: P ratio) traits. The availability of P after the pulse determined the intensity of responses by primary producers to UVR stress. All structural-physiological and functional variables significantly increased by up to two orders of magnitude in response to P enrichment. UV radiation, over a long-term scale, exerted significant deleterious effects on most structural-physiological variables when inorganic P was added at high levels (>= 30 mu g PL-1). The subsequent unexpected negative synergistic UVR x P effect on algal development did not support our initial hypothesis that P input might buffer the harmful UVR effect. UVR exerted a weak negative effect on primary production but strongly enhanced the absolute and percentage excretion of C (up to 60%), mechanism responsible of a significant reduction in autotroph C: P ratios. We propose that low sestonic C:P ratios are the outcome of an adaptive strategy of algae in environments with high UVR exposure and extreme nutrient limitation and have important implications for C flux through grazing vs. microbial food webs in oligotrophic systems.

AB We review the concept of phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) in marine ecosystems as a means of advancing bio-mechanistic models that can be coupled to the global carbon cycle and the Earth's climate system. Conventional classification of phytoplankton by size may seem arbitrary, but there appears clear links between size and environmental characteristics (availability of essential nutrients and light) that regulate photosynthesis, phytoplankton selection and succession. Taking a minimalist approach, small phytoplankton (picoplankton) survive in permanently stratified systems with low nutrients, high surface light and low light in deep clines, whereas large phytoplankton (microplankton) thrive in high nutrient, turbulent, high light, near surface systems. Nutrient-light environmental conditions are characteristic properties of globally, latitudinal-dispersed biogeochemical provinces. These contrasting nutrient-light regimes define the extreme ends of the bio-energetic scale of photosynthesis and set the end points of the primary range of phytoplankton functional processes. To determine PFTs from remotely sensed ocean colour data, there must be a specific bio-optical trait (BOT) that can be associated with the phytoplankton species or taxa. We investigate the connection of the bio-energetic scale to phytoplankton types and their BOTs, which is the first, but crucial step for classifying PFTs on the basis of functional processes, from which refinements and further partitioning can be developed.

AB Macrobenthic recolonisation patterns after complete defaunation resulting from experimentally induced hypoxia were investigated in a polyhaline, estuarine mudflat. Based on simultaneous sampling of biotic and environmental variables in replicated 16 m(2) control and defaunated plots, with a high resolution in time during 6 mo, the ecological interactions related to the macrobenthos reassembly were elucidated. Colonisation was predominantly determined by juvenile recruitment, and 3 successional stages were identified, each characterised by different species assemblages and environmental characteristics. During recovery, a shift in functional group dominance from mobile surface deposit feeders to tube-dwelling surface deposit feeders to biodestabilising taxa occurred, while their proportional dominance remained quite stable in the control plots throughout the experiment. Species colonisation patterns of later colonists revealed positive interactions with early colonising opportunistic tube-building polychaetes Pygospio elegans, while later successional species (Heteromastus filiformis, Macoma balthica) adversely affected the stable, favourable conditions created by the tube-building infauna, Transitions between different successional stages were related to recruitment of species, changes in environmental characteristics (oxygenation state of the sediment), direct and indirect ecological interactions (bio [de]stabilisation, exploitation competition for food), In general, our study suggests that macrobenthic reassembly after hypoxia is related to different types of interactions, all acting in a unique manner. Hence, macrobenthic successional dynamics in a tidal mudflat habitat should be considered as a dynamic process, related to resource availability, natural temporal variation, life history traits (e.g. opportunistic behaviour) and bio-engineering capacities of the colonising species.

AB Prey with versatile predators need diverse defenses. Such an example of a versatile predator is the voracious European green crab Carcinus maenas. Green crabs prey on snails by either crushing shells or, when shells are too tough to break, by extracting flesh through the shell opening (aperture). Among populations in the northwest Atlantic, the claw size of green crabs (an indicator of crushing strength.) co-varies with shell mass of the intertidal snail Littorina obtusata (mass is an indicator of a shell's crushing resistance); thus shell-crushing predation appears to be an important part of the predator-prey interaction. We report that aperture occlusion and soft tissue withdrawal depth (two shell-entry defenses) of L. obtusata snails co-vary with their shell mass (an anti-crushing trait) among populations. When snails were fed directly to green crabs in the laboratory, populations with smaller shell openings and deeper withdrawal depths were less frequently killed by shell-entry attacks, and these same populations, with more massive shells, were also better at resisting shell-crushing attacks. Results provide compelling evidence that. greater shell mass, a smaller shell opening, and deeper withdrawal depth are adaptive traits for snails faced with green crab predators. Furthermore, results suggest that American L. obtusata responded to the introduction of green crabs by escalating both anti-crushing and anti-entry defenses.

AB While bryozoans are important components of marine benthic ecosystems, their significance as food has scarcely been considered in any comparative study. An analysis of the phylogenetic range of predators on bryozoan colonies was undertaken to elucidate relationships among different consumers. Functional feeding traits and diet categories were determined from literature sources and observations for 399 predator species. Multivariate analyses were used to identify groups of species that consume similar food resources and have related functional traits corresponding to finding, acquiring and ingesting prey. These analyses distinguished gradients among trophic groups based on dissimilar feeding mechanisms, body sizes, types of locomotion and dietary breadths. Co-occurrences of certain diet categories also emerged as important factors. Trophic groups were largely consistent with species clusters at different taxonomic ranks among the predator phyla. At one extreme, fishes and decapod crustaceans with large dietary breadths and body sizes, and crushing or tearing feeding mechanisms, appear to consume bryozoans as minor or even incidental parts of their diets. At another extreme, species of nudibranchs, pycnogonids, turbellarians, and certain polychaetes, small arthropods and nematodes that consume bryozoans do so primarily or exclusively. Their body sizes are comparatively smaller and they often have piercing and suctorial feeding mechanisms. These differences are associated by inference with different probabilities of antagonistic encounters and likelihoods of lethal or sublethal predation. The analyses provide a baseline for ecological and evolutionary comparisons, and a broader context for the questions, 'Who eats bryozoans, how, and how frequently?'.

AB Understanding the role of history in the formation of communities has been a major challenge in community ecology. Here, we explore the role of phenotypic plasticity and its associated trait-mediated indirect interactions as a mechanism behind priority effects. Using organisms with inducible defenses as a model system, we examine how aquatic communities initially containing different predator environments are affected at the individual and community level by the colonization of a second predator. Snails and tadpoles were established in four different caged-predator environments (no predator, fish, crayfish or water bugs). These four communities were then crossed with three predator colonization treatments (no colonization, early colonization, or late colonization) using lethal water bugs as the predator. The snails responded to the caged predator environments with predator-specific behavioral and morphological defenses. In the colonization treatments, snails possessing the wrong phenotype attempted to induce phenotypic changes to defend themselves against the new risk. However, snails initially induced by a different predator environment often suffered high predation rates. Hence, temporal variation in predation risk not only challenged the snail prey to try to track this environmental variation through time by adjusting their defensive phenotypes, but also caused trait-mediated interactions between snails and the colonizing predator. For tadpoles within these communities, there was little evidence that the morphological responses of snails indirectly effected tadpole predation rates by colonizing water bugs. Unexpectedly, predation rates on tadpoles by colonizing water bugs were generally higher in the three caged-predator treatments, suggesting that water bugs elevated their foraging activity in response to potentially competing predators. In summary, we demonstrate an important priority effect in which the initial occurrence of one species of predator can facilitate predation by a second predator that colonizes at a later date (i.e. a TMII) suggesting that phenotypic plasticity can be an important driver behind priority effects (i.e. historical exposure to predators).

AB The squat lobster Munida rugosa has an unusual chela dimorphism exhibited mainly by large males. Some individuals have 'arched' chelae in which there is a gap between the dactylus and the pollex when closed, and others have a 'straight' morphology in which the dactylus and pollex oppose along most of their length. Geometric morphometric analysis indicated that, compared with males, the arched morphology does not develop fully in females, so further investigation was confined to males. In males, the distal part of the chela was similar in both the forms and seemed to be adapted to hold and shred prey items. Both morphologies had a major cylindrical tooth on the inner proximal part of the dactylus, but the arched morphology had a higher and wider propodus, a greater major tooth-pollex distance and a greater force generation than the straight morphology. The findings suggest that the arched chela morphology in M. rugosa is a sexually selected trait adapted to inflict puncture wounds on opponents during agonistic interactions. The arched morphology, therefore, appears to have evolved in males by means of sexual selection because it enhanced the function of the chela as a weapon, while retaining functionality for feeding.
