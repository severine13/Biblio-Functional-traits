AB Arctic regions have experienced pronounced biological and biophysical transformations as a result of global change processes over the last several decades. Current hypotheses propose an elevated impact of those environmental changes on the biodiversity, community composition and metabolic processes of species. The effects on ecosystem function and services, particularly when invasive or toxigenic harmful species become dominant, can be expressed over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales in plankton communities. Our study focused on the comparison of molecular biodiversity of three size-fractions (micro-, nano-, picoplankton) in the coastal pelagic zone of West Greenland and their association with environmental parameters. Molecular diversity was assessed via parallel amplicon sequencing the 28S rRNA hypervariable D1/D2 region. We showed that biodiversity distribution within the area of Uummannaq Fjord, Vaigat Strait and Disko Bay differed markedly within and among size-fractions. In general, we observed a higher diversity within the picoplankton size fraction compared to the nano- and microplankton. In multidimensional scaling analysis, community composition of all three size fractions correlated with cell size, silicate and phosphate, chlorophyll alpha (chl alpha) and dinophysistoxin (DTX). Individually, each size fraction community composition also correlated with other different environmental parameters, i.e. temperature and nitrate. We observed a more homogeneous community of the picoplankton across all stations compared to the larger size classes, despite different prevailing environmental conditions of the sampling areas. This suggests that habitat niche occupation for larger-celled species may lead to higher functional trait plasticity expressed as an enhanced range of phenotypes, whereas smaller organisms may compensate for lower potential plasticity with higher diversity. The presence of recently identified toxigenic harmful algal bloom (HAB) species (such as Alexandrium fundyense and A. ostenfeldiz) in the area points out the potential risk for this vulnerable ecosystem in a changing world.

AB Crustacean suprabenthic abundance, community structure, a-diversity (both taxonomic and trophic) and 13 diversity were studied along a West-East gradient of oligotrophy in the deep Mediterranean Sea. The assemblages were sampled with a suprabenthic sledge in three regions (western, central and eastern basins) at three water depths (1200, 2000 and 3000 m) in May-June2009. Environmental data were obtained at each sampling location including sediment properties, oceanographic variables near the seafloor and in the water column, and proxies of epipelagic productivity at the surface. Our results, concerning the crustacean component of the suprabenthos, showed complex trends in community structure and biodiversity across different spatial scales (longitudinal, bathymetric, and near-bottom distribution). A decrease in the number of species and abundance, accompanied by changes in the trophic structure of the assemblages were observed from West to East. In the eastern region the assemblages were impoverished in number of trophic guilds and trophic diversity. The West-East oligotrophic gradient was identified as the main driver in community structure as shown by the significant correlation with trophic environmental variables. Differences in community structure across regions were more marked at greater depths, while at the shallower sites assemblages were more similar. Within each basin, abundance, number of species and number of trophic groups decreased with depth, showing high turnover rates between 1200 and 2000 m depths. The small-scale (0-150 cm) vertical distribution of the suprabenthos was interpreted in relation to the species' functional traits (e.g. swimming activity, migratory behaviour, bottom dependence, feeding habits). Bottom-dependent and more mobile components of the suprabenthos were apparently responding differently to the various environmental challenges imposed by the large-scale longitudinal and bathymetric gradients. We propose that the bathyal suprabenthos in the Mediterranean Sea may be essentially modulated by environmental sorting, but while the more mobile faunal component has more efficient dispersal mechanisms, the bottom-dependent component may be affected by limited dispersal. However, this empirical interpretation has still to be proved given the important caveats of our study (e.g. typically low densities of the Mediterranean bathyal suprabenthos; limited number of samples; difficulties in standardization inherent to suprabenthic sampling operations in the deep sea).

AB 1. Evaluating the biological integrity of stream ecosystems requires a clear understanding of biological responses to anthropogenic stressors. Co-variation of stressors with natural landscape gradients has been shown to complicate the ability of biological assessments to detect community-level responses to anthropogenic stressors. Similarly, the co-varying occurrence of non-native species would also likely confound the ability of biological assessments to accurately determine biological integrity, although these relationships have been less studied.
   2. We compared fish communities in 99 wadeable tributaries (with catchments of 10-35 km(2)) of the upper Allegheny River watershed, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., to disentangle the effects of human-induced stressors associated with agricultural development, the presence of non-native brown trout (Salmo trutta) and background variation in community composition associated with natural landscape features.
   3. Multivariate analyses using both taxonomic and trait-based data revealed that environmental gradients sorted fish species into different thermal communities (coolwater versus warmwater). Layered over the shift in thermal communities was the presence of large-bodied (piscivorous) brown trout, which along with agricultural land use, was a consistent determinant of community diversity and presence-absence of nine common native species. Small-bodied taxa (minnows, darters) were the most responsive to the presence of these large non-native predators.
   4. Our results highlight how the presence of a non-native species can modify the interactions between natural and anthropogenic stressor gradients and therefore confound the ability to detect signals between land use stressors and local stream community composition. The complicated interaction between brown trout and other anthropogenic stressors documented herein is likely to be a widespread phenomenon given the global introductions of many salmonid species into systems with varying anthropogenic stressor gradients. Overall, understanding how non-native species influence stream community composition should lead to biological assessments with greater capabilities for detecting non-native effects on biological integrity relative to the more frequently evaluated land use stressors.

AB Soil aggregation, an ecosystem function correlated with the concentration of glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), is highly disturbed in saline soil. However, few studies have focused on differences in amount, composition, and ion binding capacity of GRSP in typical sodic-saline soils. In this study, a field study was performed in Songnen Plain. Combined indicators of soil salinity (Q value) were significant negatively correlated With GRSP concentration by Principal Component Analysis. Multiple linear regression models showed that soil salinity might account for 46%, 25% and 44% variation in total GRSP (T-GRSP), easily-extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) and difficultly -extractable GRSP (DE-GRSP), respectively. Soil bulk density had most important impact on GRSP concentration, followed by the pH, soil EC had the weak influence. Comparative analysis was carried out between low salinity and high-salinity soil. Purified T-GRSP of high-saline soil contained higher N content (13.13%), lower C content (43.41%) and lower functional groups relative content (e.g. C-O and Si-O-Si). Purified T-GRSP of high-salinity soil had a greater binding capacity with calcium and phosphorus, the binding capacity could compensate the GRSP loss about 29.8% and 14.1%, respectively. Our findings suggested that sodic salinization of the soil led to a decrease in GRSP concentration and a change in the component percentages. This change in composition might be related to adaptation of fungi-plant systems to varied environments. The calcium and phosphorus binding capacity had a positive dependent of soil salinization, which was possible to develop ecological management or recovery technology in the future.

AB Loss of bioturbating key species from marine sediments has been shown to strongly reduce benthic biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem functioning. It is thus of paramount importance to identify key bioturbators and quantify their effect on biogeochemical processes. To do so trait based community and species bioturbation potential (BPc and BPi) was mapped for 423 North Sea stations in the German Bight. Mapping of BPc and BPi identified Amphiura filiformis, Echinocardium cordatum and Nucula nitidosa as major bioturbating species in the German Bight. The effects of these species on benthic nutrient flux (i.e., changing concentrations of silicate Delta[SiO2], ammonium Delta[NH4+], nitrate Delta[NO3- and nitrite Delta[NO2-]) were quantified in laboratory experiments together with their bioturbation rate (D-b) and bioirrigation activity. The experiments indicated that mapped species bioturbation potential (BPi) may be a poor tool for identifying key bioturbators while calculated experimental BPi ((PBPi)-P-exp) was a good indicator for species impact on biogeochemical cycling. Out of the three investigated species only E. cordatum significantly influenced biogeochemical cycling, whereas the effect of A. filiformis remained inconclusive potentially because arm damage and regeneration may affect the bioturbation activity of many individuals. The bivalve N. nitidosa showed only little impact on biogeochemical cycling, although this species was found to be an active bioturbator. Accordingly, E. cordatum may be considered one of the most important contributors to biogeochemical cycling at the sediment-water interface in the German Bight. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The accurate reproduction of the spatial and temporal dynamics of marine benthic biodiversity requires the development of mechanistic models, based on the processes that shape macroinvertebrate communities. The modelled entities should, accordingly, be able to adequately represent the many functional roles that are performed by benthic organisms. With this goal in mind, we applied the emergent group hypothesis (EGH), which assumes functional equivalence Within and functional divergence between groups of species. The first step of the grouping involved the selection of 14 biological traits that describe the role of benthic macroinverte-brates in 7 important community assembly mechanisms. A matrix of trait values for the 240 species that occurred in the Rance estuary (Brittany, France) in 1995 formed the basis for a hierarchical classification that generated 20 functional groups, each with its own trait values. The functional groups were first evaluated based on their ability to represent observed patterns of biodiversity. The two main assumptions of the EGH were then tested, by assessing the preservation of niche attributes among the groups and the neutrality of functional differences within them. The generally positive results give us confidence in the ability of the grouping to recreate functional diversity in the Rance estuary. A first look at the emergent groups provides insights into the potential role of community assembly mechanisms in shaping biodiversity patterns. Our next steps include the derivation of general rules of interaction and their incorporation, along with the functional groups, into mechanistic models of benthic biodiversity.

AB The metacommunity approach emerged with the interest in investigating how local and regional processes interact to determine community structure. However, species distribution may differ according to biological features (e.g., dispersal mode) or system connectivity. We investigated the distribution patterns and the importance of environmental and spatial variables for benthic invertebrate metacommunity structures in a Neotropical floodplain according to hydrological periods (flood and drought) and dispersal modes (active or passive). We sampled 18 lakes during flood and drought periods in 2011. In both hydrological periods, we found a Clementsian pattern for active dispersers, with environment as the main structuring factor. The high environmental heterogeneity of this floodplain is an important factor providing high availability of favorable habitats for the establishment of active dispersers. Passive dispersers were randomly distributed in both hydrological periods. The importance of only spatial factors during the drought may indicate a restricted dispersal by inability of tracking environmental gradients. We emphasize that understanding biological community determinants could rely on trait-based analysis (i.e., dispersal mode) and complementary approaches (i.e., variance partitioning, and metacommunity structure), considering their variations over time.

AB Background: Over the last 300 years, interactions between alewives and zooplankton communities in several lakes in the U.S. have caused the alewives' morphology to transition rapidly from anadromous to landlocked. Lakes with landlocked alewives contain smaller-bodied zooplankton than those without alewives. Landlocked adult alewives display smaller body sizes, narrower gapes, smaller inter-gill-raker spacings, reach maturity at an earlier age, and are less fecund than anadromous alewives. Additionally, landlocked alewives consume pelagic prey exclusively throughout their lives whereas anadromous alewives make an ontogenetic transition from pelagic to littoral prey. These rapid, well-documented changes in the alewives' morphology provide important insights into the morphological evolution of fish. Predicting the morphological evolution of fish is crucial for fisheries and ecosystem management, but the involvement of multiple trophic interactions make predictions difficult. To obtain an improved understanding of rapid morphological change in fish, we developed an individual-based model that simulated rapid changes in the body size and gill-raker count of a fish species in a hypothetical, size-structured prey community. Model parameter values were based mainly on data from empirical studies on alewives. We adopted a functional trait approach; consequently, the model explicitly describes the relationships between prey body size, alewife body size, and alewife gill-raker count. We sought to answer two questions: ( 1) How does the impact of alewife populations on prey feed back to impact alewife size and gill raker number under several alternative scenarios? ( 2) Will the trajectory of the landlocked alewives' morphological evolution change after 150-300 years in freshwater?
   Results: Over the first 250 years, the alewives' numbers of gill-rakers only increased when reductions in their body size substantially improved their ability to forage for small prey. Additionally, alewives' gill- raker counts increased more rapidly as the adverse effects of narrow gill- raker spacings on foraging for large prey weremade less severe. For the first150- 250 years, alewives' growth decreased monotonically, and their gill- raker number increased monotonically. After the first 150-250 years, however, the alewives exhibited multiple evolutionary morphological trajectories in different trophic settings. In several of these settings, their evolutionary trajectories even reversed after the first 150-250 years.
   Conclusions: Alewives affected the abundance and morphology of their prey, which in turn changed the abundance and morphology of the alewives. Complex low-trophic-level interactions can alter the abundance and characteristics of alewives. This study suggests that the current morphology of recently (similar to 300 years)-landlocked alewives may not represent an evolutionarily stable state.

AB In a context of increasing landscape modifications and climatic changes, scale hierarchy becomes an ever more crucial issue to integrate in the analysis of drivers and stressors of biological communities, especially in river networks. To cope with this issue, we developed (i) spatial hierarchical models of functional diversity of stream invertebrate communities to assess the relative influence of local-vs. regional-scale factors in structuring community assembly, and (ii) analysis of metacommunity elements to determine the ecological processes behind the structuring. The spatial structuring of benthic invertebrate cominunities was investigated over 568 sites in South-eastern France. Community structure was mainly driven by the altitudinal gradient and spring flow variation at broad scales, with functional diversity gradually decreasing with elevation and being maximized at intermediate levels of flow variability. According to the 'elements of metacommunity structure' analysis, the prevailing influence of the altitudinal gradient was also supported by a Clenientsian structuration of invertebrate communities. Conversely, the influence of observed climatic changes in temperature and rainfall was weak and observed only at fine scales. As a result, natural environmental filters were stronger drivers of the functional diversity of communities than human-induced stressors (e.g. water pollution and hydromorphological alterations). More broadly, our results suggest that management needs to embrace the possibilities of gathering high spatial and taxonomical resolution data when analysing and predicting flow variation and climate change effects in order to preserve and restore functionally diverse communities. Moreover, to develop environmental flow schemes or restoration and climate change adaptation strategies for freshwater communities, local and regional processes need to be addressed simultaneously; equally responsible as drivers of community diversity.

AB Quantifying the density of live trees in forest stands and partitioning it between species or other stand components is critical for predicting forest dynamics and responses to management, as well as understanding the impacts of stand composition and structure on productivity. As plant traits such as shade tolerance have been proven to refine understanding of plant community dynamics, we extended a previous model relating maximum stand density to wood specific gravity to incorporate shade tolerance as an additional functional trait. Additionally, we included climatic variables that might influence ecological dynamics and modulate species-specific traits, across a region and also potentially over time under climate change scenarios. We used data from the USDA Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis program for three states in the northern United States (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan) that reflect strong gradients in climate and species composition, to fit a maximum density model by quantile regression. The resulting strictly additive density measure conforms well to both existing silvicultural guidance and to observed densities of monocultures that lack such guidance. Wood specific gravity appears to interact with precipitation, while shade tolerance interacts with temperature, in driving maximum density relationships. Our proposed maximum stand density model is not only parsimonious for field application in management situations, but also empowers the evaluation of the effects of future climate and tree range scenarios on forest management guidelines.

AB Predators are instrumental in structuring natural communities and ecosystem processes. The strong effects of predators are often attributed to their high trophic position in the food web. However, most predators have to grow and move up the food chain before reaching their final trophic position, and during this developmental process their traits, interactions and abundances change. Here, we show that this process of 'moving up' the food chain during development strongly determines the ecological role of a predator. By experimentally manipulating the succession of developmental stages of a predatory salamander in a seasonal aquatic ecosystem, we found that the effects of this apex predator on the ecosystem typically declined with age and size. Furthermore, younger, smaller predator stages had long-lasting effects on community structure and ecosystem function that determined the effects of subsequent older, larger stages. Consequently, the legacy effects of early stages largely shaped the impact of the predator on the ecosystem, which could not simply be inferred from its final trophic position. Our results highlight that accounting for all life stages when managing natural populations is crucial to preserve the functioning of natural ecosystems, especially given that early life stages of species are often particularly vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Rotifer community is often used as a taxon-based bioindicator for water quality. However, studies of the planktonic community from the viewpoint of functional groups in freshwater ecosystems have been limited, particularly for rotifers. Because rotifers have various trophi types determining their feeding strategies, thereby representing an ecological niche, their functional feeding groups can act as biological and ecological indicators in lakes and reservoirs where planktonic communities are dominant. We analyzed the patterns of spatial distribution of the rotifer community in various reservoirs and then its relationship with water quality through redundancy and regression analyses. Compared with taxon-based composition, the response of trophi-based composition appears simplistic and showed clearer tendency in relation with water-quality variables. Each trophi responded differently by the degree of eutrophication indicating that each trophi group is possibly affected by environments such as the combinations of water-quality variables in different ways.

AB Reliable ecosystem status assessment of coastal and marine environments is key due to mounting pressures from human activities. Aiming at a successful management, a plethora of evaluation tools currently exist, but there is no consensus on what index or indices should be used by environmental managers in establishing benthic quality.
   The main goal of this investigation was to evaluate the suitability of thermodynamic-oriented indicators (Eco-Exergy and Specific Eco-Exergy) and trait-based indices (Rao's Quadratic Entropy, Functional Redundancy and Community-Weighted Mean trait value) as tools to capture potential ecological changes, comprehending their utility for addressing specific management objectives. In order to do so, a long-term data set (1993-2012) from a southern European estuary (Mondego estuary, Portugal) was used to assess the responsiveness of macroinvertebrates assemblages to a large-scale management intervention, and the performance of thermodynamic-oriented indicators and trait-based indices was compared.
   The results indicated that the undertaken management efforts were successful at improving the ecosystem state and confirmed that hydrodynamic conditions in the estuary have been the major drivers of the changes observed over the last three decades. Both Exergy-based and trait-based indices coherently reflected the ecological changes observed along the temporal disturbance-recovery gradient analysed. Indices response was congruent but of different nature and detail level. Trait-based indices provided a more detailed assessment of the benthic communities and informative picture than Exergy-based indices but the overall outcome of both types of indices was broadly convergent. Combining multiple indicators should thus be more likely to improve transparency and to provide a more robust assessment method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gene based variations are consequential only if are in the vicinity or within some functionally significant regions of 3-dimensional encoded protein. Information regarding significant structural attributes of many proteins is underway and based on data of polymorphisms identified in different parts of the genes. Oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-1 (OLR1) gene was reported to be significantly associated with high fat content in milk. Oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-1 (OLR1) is a key cell surface receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein. In this study, protein structural attributes of OLR1 were constructed by homology modelling and functionally significant regions were identified, which might have a role in fatty acid synthesis. This OLR1 is a 270-residue protein in bovine carrying 52-amino acid-long signal peptide. A Pro-His substitution was noted at 17th position, which enhanced OLR1 protein hydrophilicity for enhanced attachments. A transmembrane helix was identified between 35-67th residue and another functionally significant variant was identified at position 181, which was part of Domain-3. This domain is a functionally active part of the receptor in fat synthesis. Results of the study, illustrated that mutations in functionally significant parts of the OLR1 protein affect the high fat content in the buffalo milk.

AB Some macrophytes species show a high growth potential, colonizing large areas on aquatic environments. Cattail (Typha angustifolia L.) uncontrolled growth causes several problems to human activities and local biodiversity, but this also may lead to competition and further problems for this species itself. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate anatomical modifications on T. angustifolia plants from different population densities, once it can help to understand its biology. Roots and leaves were collected from natural populations growing under high and low densities. These plant materials were fixed and submitted to usual plant microtechnique procedures. Slides were observed and photographed under light microscopy and images were analyzed in the UTHSCSA-Imagetool software. The experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments and ten replicates, data were submitted to one-way ANOVA and Scott-Knott test at p<0.05. Leaves from low density populations showed higher stomatal density and index. These modifications on stomatal characteristics were more evident on the leaf abaxial surface. Plants from low density populations showed thicker mesophyll and higher proportion of aerenchymal area. Roots from low density populations showed a higher proportion of the vascular cylinder. Whereas, plants from higher density populations showed greater thickness of the endodermis, exodermis, phloem and root cortex. Higher density populations showed a higher proportion of aerenchymal gaps in the root cortex. Therefore, cattail plants from populations growing under high density population show anatomical traits typical of plants under stress, which promotes the development of less functional anatomical modifications to aquatic environments.

AB Waterbirds play important roles in maintaining ecosystem functioning in wetlands. However, the lack of essential information about the levels of interaction between waterbirds and wetland characteristics is a major impediment for service valuation. In this study, we examined the influence of the flood pulse across different freshwater habitats on the functional diversity and possible assembly structuring mechanisms of herons and storks in a neotropical floodplain. We investigated functional richness, evenness and divergence as descriptors of the functional diversity in rivers, channels and both connected and isolated lagoons across different phases of the hydrological cycle. We also compared observed values of functional diversity with expected null models to untangle the main mechanisms driving assemblages. We found spatiotemporal variation in functional diversity in wader assemblages of the high Parana River floodplain. The functional diversity of Pelecaniformes and Ciconiiformes varied mainly in rivers, channels and connected lagoons opposed to isolated lagoons in a floodplain, and mostly during flood events, right after floods or after a long period of drought. This suggests that the variation in the water level plays different roles in maintaining wading birds' functional diversity in connected and isolated habitats. Also, wading bird assemblages in this floodplain may be structured by neutral mechanisms, independent of habitat type or hydrological period, which may support the idea that species traits are not important in explaining their coexistence patterns. Our study contributes to the understanding of how environmental variations may affect functional diversity, a first step towards understanding how changes in waterbird communities affect the magnitude and stability of services provided by them.

AB Trait-based approaches are widely used in community ecology and invasion biology to unravel underlying mechanisms of vegetation dynamics. Although fundamental trade-offs between specific traits and invasibility are well described among terrestrial plants, little is known about their role and function in aquatic plant species. In this study, we examine the functional differences of aquatic alien and native plants stating that alien and native species differ in selected leaf traits. Our investigation is based on 60 taxa ( 21 alien and 39 native) collected from 22 freshwater units of Hungarian and Italian lowlands and highlands. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the effects of nativeness on four fundamental traits ( leaf area, leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area, and leaf nitrogen content), while the influence of growth-form, altitude, and site were employed simultaneously. We found significantly higher values of leaf areas and significantly lower values of specific leaf areas for alien species if growth-form was included in the model as an additional predictor. We showed that the trait-based approach of autochthony can apply to aquatic environments similar to terrestrial ones, and leaf traits have relevance in explaining aquatic plant ecology whether traits are combined with growth-forms as a fixed factor. Our results confirm the importance of traits related to competitive ability in the process of aquatic plant invasions. Alien aquatic plants can be characterized as species producing soft leaves faster. We argue that the functional traits of alien aquatic plants are strongly growth-form dependent. Using the trait-based approach, we found reliable characteristics of aquatic plants related to species invasions, which might be used, for example, in conservation management.

AB The cichlid family features some of the most spectacular examples of adaptive radiation. Evolutionary studies have highlighted the importance of both trophic adaptation and sexual selection in cichlid speciation. However, it is poorly understood what processes drive the composition and diversity of local cichlid species assemblages on relatively short, ecological timescales. Here, we investigate the relative importance of niche-based and neutral processes in determining the composition and diversity of cichlid communities inhabiting various environmental conditions in the littoral zone ofLake Tanganyika, Zambia. We collected data on cichlid abundance, morphometrics, and local environments. We analyzed relationships between mean trait values, community composition, and environmental variation, and used a recently developed modeling technique (STEPCAM) to estimate the contributions of niche-based and neutral processes to community assembly. Contrary to our expectations, our results show that stochastic processes, and not niche-based processes, were responsible for the majority of cichlid community assembly. We also found that the relative importance of niche-based and neutral processes was constant across environments. However, we found significant relationships between environmental variation, community trait means, and community composition. These relationships were caused by niche-based processes, as they disappeared in simulated, purely neutrally assembled communities. Importantly, these results can potentially reconcile seemingly contrasting findings in the literature about the importance of either niche-based or neutral-based processes in community assembly, as we show that significant trait relationships can already be found in nearly (but not completely) neutrally assembled communities; that is, even a small deviation from neutrality can have major effects on community patterns.

AB Local abiotic filters and regional processes (i.e., regional pools of species that are dispersal-limited to varying degrees) interactively structure the development of vegetation in human-disturbed habitats, yet their relative contributions to this process are still to be determined. In this study conducted in the Czech Republic, we related plant species diversity and composition of 10 fly ash and 7 mine tailings to local edaphic conditions, and to vegetation from a 100-m perimeter (regional species pool). We found that the species richness and composition on the tailings were significantly associated with diversity and composition of vegetation in the surroundings, but not with the local edaphic conditions. Species from adjacent vegetation that were more abundant and those producing lighter seeds were more likely to establish on the tailings. The same characteristics also enhanced species abundance on the tailings, but the two predictors explained less than 10% in variation of establishment success or of species abundance. A non-significant relationship between species number and tailings size, but a significant association between diversity and time of vegetation development indicate that the study systems are still far from equilibrium. Our study provides evidence for a strong effect of regional processes, with a limited influence of measured edaphic conditions on plant communities developing de novo. It also highlights the necessity to consider the broader spatial context in the analysis of vegetation succession in human-disturbed habitats.

AB Drums (family Sciaenidae) are common in tropical to temperate coastal and estuarine habitats worldwide and present a broad spectrum of morphological diversity. The anatomical variation in this family is particularly evident in their feeding apparatus, which may reflect the partitioning of adult foraging habitats. Adult and early life history stage sciaenids may display ecomorphological patterns in oral and pharyngeal jaw elements but because sciaenids are hierarchically related, the morphological variation of the feeding apparatus cannot be analyzed as independent data. Morphological patterns have been identified in three sciaenid genera from the Chesapeake Bay but it is not known if these patterns are present in other genera of the family and if such patterns are constrained by phylogenetic history. In this study, phylogenetic comparative methods were applied to two sets of oral jaw data obtained from growth series of 11 species of cleared and double-stained Chesapeake Bay sciaenids and alcohol-preserved museum specimens representing 65 of the 66 recognized genera to determine the magnitude of phylogenetic dependence present in the structure of the oral jaws using a recent molecular phylogeny of the family. Pagel's lambda, a measure of phylogenetic signal, was low for pelagic sciaenids in premaxilla, lower jaw, and ascending process lengths, indicating influence of selective forces on the condition of these traits. Conversely, for benthic sciaenids, phylogenetic signal was high for lower jaw and ascending process lengths, indicating significant phylogenetic constraint for their condition in these taxa. Pagel's lambda was intermediate for premaxilla length in benthic sciaenids, suggesting that the length of the premaxilla is influenced by a mix of selective forces and phylogenetic constraint. Although the ecomorphological patterns identified in the oral jaws of scaienids are not entirely free of phylogenetic dependence, selective forces related to foraging are likely driving the evolution of these structures.

AB Tank bromeliads form a conspicuous, yet neglected freshwater habitat in Neotropical forests. Recent studies driven by interests in medical entomology, fundamental aspects of bromeliad ecology and experimental research on food webs have, however, prompted increasing interest in bromeliad aquatic ecosystems. As yet, there is nothing in the literature about the life histories and environmental drivers of invertebrate population dynamics in tank bromeliads. Based on fortnightly samples taken over oneyear, size frequency plots and individual dry masses allowed us to establish the life cycles and growth rates of the dominant aquatic invertebrates in a common bromeliad species of French Guiana. Linear mixed-effect models and Mantel tests were used to predict changes in density, biomass, and growth rates in relation to temperature, rainfall, humidity and detrital resources. Annual variations in invertebrate densities and biomasses could be described according to three types of distribution: unimodal, bimodal or almost constant. Despite seasonal variations, precipitation, temperature, relative humidity and detritus concentration accounted significantly for changes in density and biomass, but we found no significant responses in growth rates of most invertebrate species. Species rather displayed non-seasonal life cycles with overlapping cohorts throughout the year. There was also a trend for delayed abundance peaks among congeneric species sharing similar functional traits, suggesting temporal partitioning of available resources. Beyond novel knowledge, quantitative information on life histories is important to predict food-web dynamics under the influence of external forcing and self-organisation. Our results suggest that changes in species distribution that will affect population dynamics through biotic interactions in space and/or time could have greater effects on food webs and ecosystem functioning than changes in environmental factors per se.

AB The spatial organisation of biotic communities derives from factors operating at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Despite strong scientific evidence of prevalent spatial control of community composition in freshwater ecosystems, local environmental factors are often considered as the main drivers of community change. Furthermore, taxonomic approaches are most frequently used, and few studies have compared the relative importance of local and regional control of trait versus the taxonomic composition in stream ecosystems. Using a spatially dense data set covering all stream sizes in a lowland European region of c. 42000km(2) and three organism groups (macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fishes), we compared the relative importance of spatial and environmental determinants of species and trait composition in the study streams, classified into headwaters (stream order 1-2) and downstream sites (stream order >2). We hypothesised that (i) there is a higher correspondence between environmental conditions and trait composition than with species composition, (ii) dispersal limitation (pure spatial structuring) is greater in headwaters than in downstream sites and (iii) dispersal limitation (pure spatial structuring) is weakest for macroinvertebrates, intermediate for macrophytes and strongest for fishes. The most consistent pattern across organisms and stream order groups was a higher correspondence between environmental variation and trait composition as well as a higher number of environmental variables significantly related to trait composition than with species composition (hypothesis 1). Spatial structuring peaked in headwater macrophyte communities and downstream fish communities (hypotheses 2 & 3) - a pattern that was amplified when separate analyses of traits describing species dispersal potential were undertaken. Our study highlights the potential of traits to capture multiple environmental changes in stream ecosystems and illustrates how organism-specific and highly context-dependent patterns in community organisation can emerge as a consequence of interactions between habitat connectivity (i.e. top versus lower parts of the stream network) and organism dispersal potential.

AB Biogeographical patterns have an ecological basis, but few empirical studies possess the necessary scale and resolution relevant for investigation. The Barents Sea shelf provides an ideal study area, as it is a transition area between Atlantic and Arctic regions, and is sampled by a comprehensive survey of all major functional groups. We studied spatial variation in species composition of demersal fish and benthos to elucidate how fish and benthos communities co-varied in relation to environmental variables. We applied co-correspondence analysis on presence-absence data of 64 fishes and 302 benthos taxa from 329 bottom trawl hauls taken at the Barents Sea ecosystem survey in August-September 2011. We found highly significant similarities in the spatial pattern of distribution of benthos and fishes, despite their differences in motility and other ecological traits. The first common ordination axis separated boreal species in the south-west (Atlantic temperate water) from Arctic species in the north-east (Arctic cold water, ice-covered in winter). The second common axis separated shallow bank species from species found in deep basins and trenches. Our results show that fish and benthos communities had a similar relationship to the environmental gradients at the scale of hundreds to thousands of kilometres. We further discussed how fish-benthos interactions vary between sub-regions in the Barents Sea based on species traits and a food web topology for the Barents Sea. This study forms a basis for further investigations on links between fish and benthos communities in the Barents Sea.

AB 1. Trait-based approaches have the potential to reveal general and predictive relationships between organisms and ecosystem functioning. However, the mechanisms underlying the functional structure of communities are still unclear. Within terrestrial ecosystems, several studies have shown that many ecological processes are controlled by the interacting above-and belowground compartments. However, few studies have used traits to reveal the functional relationships between plants and soil fauna. Mostly, research combining plants and soil fauna solely used the traits of one assemblage in predictive studies.
   2. Above-ground (plants) and below-ground (Collembola) compartments were sampled over a flooding gradient in northern France along the Seine River. First, we measured the effect of flooding on functional and taxonomic assembly within both communities. We then considered the linkages between plant and Collembolan species richness, community traits and assessed whether traits of both compartments converged at high flooding intensity (abiotic filtering) and diverged when this constraint is released (biotic filtering).
   3. Species richness of both taxa followed the same bell-shaped pattern along the gradient, while a similar significant pattern of functional richness was only observed for plants. Further analyses revealed a progressive shift from trait convergence to divergence for plants, but not for Collembola, as constraints intensity decreased. Instead, our results highlighted that Collembola traits were mainly linked to the variations in plant traits. This leads, within Collembola assemblages, to convergence of a subset of perception and habitat-related traits for which the relationship with plant traits was assessed.
   4. Synthesis. Using a trait-based approach, our study highlighted that functional relationships occur between above-and below-ground compartments. We underlined that functional composition of plant communities plays a key role in structuring Collembola assemblages in addition to the role of abiotic variables. Our study clearly shows that functional diversity provides a new approach to link the above-and below-ground compartments and might, therefore, be further considered when studying ecological processes at the interface between both compartments.

AB 1. Plant species around the world invest in seed dispersal by producing large numbers of seeds, with a wide range of morphological adaptations that facilitate dispersal. Not all dispersed seeds reach suitable sites, however, and plants can significantly improve their fitness by increasing the proportion of seeds arriving at suitable sites for germination and establishment. Disproportionate dispersal to suitable sites is known as 'directed dispersal'. Yet, mechanisms of directed dispersal are only known for a limited number of animal-dispersed plant species.
   2. We tested the hypothesis that directed dispersal can also be driven by abiotic vectors, such as water or wind. We used a tiered approach, combining analyses of experimental, field and literature data on wetland plant species and evaluating the potential for evolution of directed dispersal with a spatially explicit individual-based model.
   3. The data collected demonstrate that wetland plants produce seeds with adaptations to promote transportation and deposition by water towards microsites along the hydrological gradient where they germinate and establish best. Aquatic species produce seeds that sink and are transported by water as bed load towards inundated sites. In contrast, shoreline species produce seeds that float for very long periods of time so that they are eventually entrapped by shoreline vegetation or deposited at the waterline. Our model simulations confirm that the patterns we observed in nature can evolve under natural selection through adaptations in seed buoyancy.
   4. For wind dispersal, the situation is more complex. Wind does not provide directed dispersal in the strictest sense but, rather, simply appears to be the best available dispersal vector for more terrestrial wetland plant species to reach drier areas in a wet environment.
   5. Synthesis. We show that directed dispersal towards specific, suitable microsites is not exclusive to animal-dispersed plant species, but may be far more common in plants - also in species dispersed by abiotic vectors, in particular water. As water and wind are very common dispersal vectors throughout the plant kingdom, directed dispersal (and not just dispersal distance) seems to be of general importance for the ecology of plants.

AB Natural fluctuations in flow are important for maintaining the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems. However, the flow regime of many rivers has been modified. We assessed the impact of water chemistry, habitat and streamflow characteristics on macroinvertebrates and benthic algae, comparing 20 regulated with 20 unregulated sites. Flow regime, calculated from daily averaged discharge over the five years preceding sampling, was generally more stable at regulated sites, with higher relative discharges in winter, lower relative discharges in spring and smaller differences between upper and lower percentiles. However, no consistent differences in benthic algal or macroinvertebrate structural and functional traits occurred between regulated and unregulated sites. When regulated and unregulated sites were pooled, overall flow regime, calculated as principal components of discharge characteristics over the five years preceding sampling, affected macroinvertebrate species assemblages, but not indices used for ecosystem status assessment or functional feeding groups. This indicates that, while species identity shifted with changing flow regime, the exchanged taxa had similar feeding habits. In contrast to macroinvertebrates, overall flow regime did not affect benthic algae. Our results indicate that overall flow regime affected the species pool of macroinvertebrates from which recolonization after extreme events may occur, but not of benthic algae. When individual components of flow regime were analyzed separately, high June (i.e. three months before sampling) flow maxima were associated with low benthic algal taxon richness, presumably due to scouring. Macroinvertebrate taxon richness decreased with lower relative minimum discharges, presumably due to temporary drying of parts of the riverbed. However, recolonization after such extreme events presumably is fast. Generally, macroinvertebrate and benthic algal assemblages were more closely related to water physico-chemical than to hydrological variables. Our results suggest that macroinvertebrate and benthic algal indices commonly used for ecological status assessment are applicable also in regulated rivers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The composition and dynamics of plankton communities are critically affected by human-induced environmental changes. We analysed 33 years of phytoplankton monthly data collected in Lake Zurich (Switzerland), assigning organisms (genus level) to taxonomic groups (class, family), Reynolds associations and size categories. The aim was to understand how eutrophication and climate change have influenced taxa co-occurrence patterns within and between groups over the lake water column (14 depths, 0-135 m), using null-models to test for non-random spatial (depth) assembly. We found that the whole community showed high taxa co-occurrence levels, significantly deviating over time from random assembly concurrently with lake warming and reduced nutrient loading. This pattern was driven mostly by the depth structure of metalimnetic assemblages during summer and autumn. The prevalence of non-random spatial patterns changed for different taxonomic and functional groups, with only few significant deviations from null-model expectations. Within taxonomic and functional groups (particularly Classes and size categories), the frequency of spatial overdispersion of taxa decreased over time while the frequency of clustering increased. Our data suggest that the relative importance of mechanisms determining phytoplankton metacommunity dynamics have changed along with environmental gradients shaping water column structure.

AB The composition and diversity of biotic assemblages is regulated by a complex interplay of environmental features. We investigated the influence of climate and the aquatic habitat conditions on the larval traits and the structure of amphibian larval guilds in north-western Africa. We classified the species into morphological groups, based on external traits: body shape, size, and the relative positions of the eyes and oral apparatus. We characterized the guild diversity based on species richness and interspecific phylogenetic/functional relationships. The larvae of the urodeles were classified as typical of either the stream or pond type, and the anurans as typical of either the lentic-benthic or lentic-nektonic type. The variations in the body shapes of both urodeles and anurans were associated with the type of aquatic habitat (lentic vs lotic) and the types of predators present. Most of the urodele guilds (98.9%) contained a single species, whereas the anuran guilds were usually more diverse. Both the phylogenetic and functional diversity of the anuran guilds were positively influenced by the size of the aquatic habitat and negatively by aridity. In anurans, the benthic and nektonic morphological types frequently co-occurred, possibly influenced by their opportunistic breeding strategies.

AB Variation in host responses to pathogens can have cascading effects on populations and communities when some individuals or groups of individuals display disproportionate vulnerability to infection or differ in their competence to transmit infection. The fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been detected in almost 700 different amphibian species and is implicated in numerous global amphibian population declines. Identifying key hosts in the amphibian-Bd system those who are at greatest risk or who pose the greatest risk for others is challenging due in part to many extrinsic environmental factors driving spatiotemporal Bd distribution and context-dependent host responses to Bd in the wild. One way to improve predictive risk models and generate testable mechanistic hypotheses about vulnerability is to complement what we know about the spatial epidemiology of Bd with data collected through comparative experimental studies. We used standardized pathogen challenges to quantify amphibian survival and infection trajectories across 20 post-metamorphic North American species raised from eggs. We then incorporated trait-based models to investigate the predictive power of phylogenetic history, habitat use, and ecological and life history traits in explaining responses to Bd. True frogs (Ranidae) displayed the lowest infection intensities, whereas toads (Bufonidae) generally displayed the greatest levels of mortality after Bd exposure. Affiliation with ephemeral aquatic habitat and breadth of habitat use were strong predictors of vulnerability to and intensity of infection and several other traits including body size, lifespan, age at sexual maturity, and geographic range also appeared in top models explaining host responses to Bd. Several of the species examined are highly understudied with respect to Bd such that this study represents the first experimental susceptibility data. Combining insights gained from experimental studies with observations of landscape level disease prevalence may help explain current and predict future pathogen dynamics in the Bd system.

AB The Puyehue-Cordon Caulle Volcanic Complex eruption occurred on June 4, 2011 (2236 m a.s.l. 40 degrees 32'S, 72 degrees 7'W). As a consequence, wide areas of Argentina were covered by volcanic ash. In order to investigate the effects of ashfall on chironomid assemblages, we conducted a study at Nireco River in the southwestern part of the Natural Reserve of Nahuel Huapi National Park that crosses the city of San Carlos de Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina. We assessed changes in chironomid assemblage attributes and 18 biological traits, by comparing pre-eruption data (December 2009 and December 2010) with post-eruption data (November 2011). Volcanic ash caused negative effects on the chironomid assemblages, where richness and density decreased significantly and the subfamilies Podonominae, Tanypodinae and Chironominae disappeared. The ordination method (principal component analysis) based on abundance of taxa and functional trait composition distinguished pre-eruption from post-eruption periods. Specific tolerance to sedimentation was related to traits mostly associated with predaceous habits such as small size, large head, retractile antennae, long prolegs, presence of ligula and long apical mandibular tooth.

AB Hybrid phenotypes are often intermediate between those of parental species. However, hybridization can generate novel phenotypes when traits are complex. For instance, even when the morphologies of individual musculo-skeletal components do not segregate outside the parental range in hybrid offspring, complex functional systems can exhibit emergent phenotypes whose mechanics exceed the parental values. To determine if transgression in mechanics could facilitate divergence during an adaptive radiation, we examined three functional systems in the trophic apparatus of Lake Malawi cichlid fishes. We conducted a simulation study of hybridization between species pairs whose morphology for three functional systems was empirically measured, to determine how the evolutionary divergence of parental species influences the frequency that hybridization could produce mechanics that transgress the parental range. Our simulations suggest that the complex mechanical systems of the cichlid trophic apparatus commonly exhibit greater transgression between more recently diverged cichlid species. Because (1) all three mechanical systems produce hybrids with transgressive mechanics in Lake Malawi cichlids, (2) hybridization is common, and (3) single hybrid crosses often recapitulate a substantial diversity of mechanics, we conclude that mechanical transgressive segregation could play an important role in the rapid accumulation of phenotypic variation in adaptive radiations.

AB Over fifty years of research on freshwater macroinvertebrates has been driven largely by the state of the taxonomy of these organisms. Significant advances have been and continue to be made in developing ever more refined keys to macroinvertebrate groups. When advances in macroinvertebrate ecological research are restricted by the level of detail in identifications, then analysis by function is a viable alternative. The focus on function, namely adaptations of macroinvertebrates to habitats and the utilization of food resources, has facilitated ecological evaluation of freshwater ecosystems. This classification is based not on what insects eat, but how they obtain their food. These categories are called "functional feeding groups", as the name implies, denoting their functional role when describing how and where they feed. This is the basis for the functional feeding group (FFG) method that was initially developed in the early 1960s. Taxonomy is applied only to the level of detail that allows assignment to one of five functional feeding group categories: detrital shredders, scrapers, filtering collectors, gatherers, and predators. The aim of this short communication, originating from the presentation of R.W. Merritt at the Biomonitoring Symposium in Rome, 2015, is to promote the use of a functional approach in biomonitoring, especially in Italian and European lotic systems. Here, we present two case studies and we discuss the advantages of the method, especially considering the great availability of quantitative data on macroinvertebrates after the implementation of the WFD 2000/60. We are confident that the increase of functional assessment of ecosystem attributes could have important and direct repercussions in the understanding and management of running waters.

AB Macrophytes are important elements of freshwater ecosystems, fulfilling a pivotal role in biogeochemical cycles. The synoptic capabilities provided by remote sensing make it a powerful tool for monitoring aquatic vegetation characteristics and the functional status of shallow lake systems in which they occur. The latest generation of airborne and spaceborne imaging sensors can be effectively exploited for mapping morphologically and physiologically relevant vegetation features based on their canopy spectral response. The objectives of this study were to calibrate semi-empirical models for mapping macrophyte morphological traits (i.e., fractional cover, leaf area index and above-water biomass) from hyperspectral data, and to investigate the capabilities of remote sensing in supporting macrophyte monitoring and management. We calibrated spectral models using in situ reflectance and morphological trait measures and applied them to airborne hyperspectral imaging data, acquired over two shallow European water bodies (Lake Hidvegi, in Hungary, and Mantua lakes system, in Italy) in two key phenological phases. Maps of morphological traits were produced covering a broad range of aquatic plant types (submerged, floating, and emergent), common to temperate and continental regions, with an error level of 5.4% for fractional cover, 0.10 m(2) m(-2) for leaf area index, and 0.06 kg m(-2) for above-water biomass. Based on these maps, we discuss how remote sensing could support monitoring strategies and shallow lake management with reference to our two case studies: i.e., by providing insight into spatial and species-wise variability, by assessing nutrient uptake by aquatic plants, and by identifying hotspot areas where invasive species could become a threat to ecosystem functioning and service provision.

AB Comprehensive analysis of clay rattle in the shape of bear head found on the Krotovo settlement Vengerovo-2 (Baraba forest-steppe) is represented in the article. The study contains the results of morphological, fluoroscopic and technological survey of the artifact. The rattle is hollow ceramic ball with molded details: ears, nose, ajar chops, and a handle. Morphological traits (stretched lips, absence of cavity between forehead and nose bridge, roundish skull) indicate young age of the depicted specimen. Its surface was treated with notched tool to imitate pelage of an animal. The workpiece was made in the rag technic. Inside the rattle there were found 16 ceramic balls, which utter specific sound with joggle. Authors offer several variants of functional interpretation of the artifact, relying on wide archaeological, ethnographic and ethnohystorical parallels. The first version is connected with straight analogies in modern culture of childhood and supposes that this rattle was used as a child's toy. The second version is that this noisy zoomorphic object was used with ritual purpose. The rattle from the sacral place of the Neolithic site near the Voznesenovka village (Amur River) is presented as the closest analogy. Also, authors adduce a range of archaeological and ethnographic data significant about the value of bear's image and in particular bear's head in products of ancient and medieval Western Siberia population's plastic arts. Besides the stylistics and zoomorphic image, the importance of the "sound" function is noticed. As examples of analogy there are mentioned: common usage of noisy pendants in shaman's practice and costume; wide spreading of noisy bronze arched pendants in the medieval period in Prikamye region, where central position belongs to the bear in sacrificial pose. The third version supposes usage of the rattle as musical percussion instrument. Ceramic balls are found rather frequently on the sites of Krotovo culture. On the base of this version authors suggest hypothesis that probably these balls pertain to such or larger musical instruments, which were made from the organic materials (wood, leather etc.). Also there are noted other scientists' hypotheses about usage of rattles in gambling and as fertility amulet. In conclusion authors notice that suggested variants of this object usage are not mutually exclusive. This artifact, such as similar objects and analogies, probably was multifunctional and its interpretation tightly bound to chronological and cultural historical context.

AB The protected European stone crayfish, Austropotamobius torrentium, is a host to epibionts inhabiting its exoskeleton. Despite evidence of the close association of these epibionts to the crayfish and the beneficial services provided for the crayfish, the main factors influencing their occurrence, distribution and abundance are still poorly understood. In order to investigate the stone crayfish epibiont community, the ecological requirements of individual species, and aspects of the host-epibiont relationship we collected data at several crayfish populations in Austria, Switzerland and Germany. At each location, we recorded the epibiont position on the crayfish host along with a number of biotic and abiotic parameters. Apart from recording the Branchiobdella species B. parasita, B. hexadonta, B. pentadonta and B. balcanica, we detected for the first time the polychaete Hystricosoma chappuisi in the European Alps. Species-specific biogeographical and habitat factors such as river catchment borders, crayfish length, water temperature and nutrients concentration were identified to be important for the occurrence and abundance of epibionts. Branchiobdella species were strongly linked to certain host body areas, providing evidence for the existence of different functional traits within the annelid assemblage. With this study we demonstrate that the crayfish-epibionts relationship includes structural and functional complexities that can be important for defining management units in future conservation policies. Due to benefits for the mutualistic relationship, restocking and reintroduction actions are likely to be more successful, if ecological requirements of both the host and the epibiont species are considered.

AB Land use and occupation by human populations can cause many environmental changes in streams, which affect not only the number and abundance of species but also the biological characteristics or functional traits of the individuals. Here we investigated the influence of different land uses (agriculture and urbanization) on taxonomic and functional diversity of aquatic insects in drift samples from Neotropical streams. To this end, we used 2 diversity metrics: the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') to quantify taxonomic diversity and Rao's quadratic entropy index (Q) to measure functional diversity. In addition, we analyzed the importance of environmental variables on functional traits composition. The high heterogeneity of habitats in rural streams contributed to the occurrence of sensitive taxa (i.e., specialist taxa), which mostly do not share the same categories of functional traits, providing higher functional diversity in these streams. Conversely, the impacts resulting from urbanization processes changed the abiotic variables and led to habitat simplification, favoring the dominance of tolerant (generalist) taxa, which share more traits, thus reducing the taxonomic and functional diversity in these sites. Assessing the functional diversity of aquatic insects under the influence of different land uses is of utmost importance to better understand the functioning of aquatic communities impacted by land use change.

AB Different components of biological diversity of leeches (Hirudinea), sampled in lowland watercourses in Poland were compared between sites differed in terms of environmental quality, measured by officially approved procedures. Indices based on taxonomic diversity, rarefied species richness, taxonomic distinctness, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity were considered in the analysis, for sites belonging to three biocoenotic types of watercourses. In most cases values of all indices except Pielou's evenness show unimodal relationships with environmental quality and in any case monotonic increase in diversity was not shown. Median values of diversity were significantly higher and its highest values were significantly more frequent at sites with moderate than with low or high environmental quality. This pattern of relationships was observed both for indices based on presence/absence data and those based on relative abundance of species. The significance of this mode of relationships differed between biocoenotic types and between procedures using to measure environmental quality. The results obtained show low and doubtful usefulness of each component of leech diversity as an element of biological assessment in lowland watercourses.

AB Background: Floodplain wetlands feature high plant biodiversity, comprising variability in several organisation levels and at different scales.
   Aims: In a large river floodplain, we aimed to answer whether taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional alpha-diversity of herbaceous assemblages responded to hydrogeomorphic features conditioning the local flood pulse and/or to soil features; and to determine the relationship between beta-diversity and geographic and environmental distances.
   Methods: Taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional alpha-diversity indices were computed in 82 sites in the Lower Parana River floodplain. Relationships between alpha-diversity and environment were explored by generalised linear models. Spatial structure was assessed by semi-variograms. Responses of partitions of beta-diversity to geographic or environmental distances were tested through multiple regressions in distance matrices.
   Results: Taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha-diversity showed a similar pattern in relation to environment, especially to hydrogeomorphic features. The regression model fitted to species richness had the highest explanatory power. Regarding functional alpha-diversity, only the number of plant functional types responded to environmental features. Partitions of beta-diversity, particularly the replacement of functional strategies, were better explained by environmental than by geographic distances.
   Conclusions: The diversity patterns of plant assemblages in a large river floodplain highlight the importance of heterogeneity conditioning the local effect of flood pulse regimes.

AB The cave-dwelling fauna of Zagros region (Northern Iran) has been insufficiently studied. Most of the known cave-specialized species (15 out of 21) belong to the genus Niphargus Schiodte, 1849, yet species composition of this genus is not resolved. In this research, we studied Niphargus specimens from two recently sampled caves, Shoei and Darvish-Olya Caves, from Kurdistan Province in Iran. The specimens belong to a single, yet undescribed species, which can be diagnosed using mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear sequences (28S rDNA gene sequences) as well as several morphological traits. Based on combined evidence from morphology and molecular characters, we described and named new species, N. kurdistanensis sp. nov.. The newly described species is phylogenetically nested within the clade comprising Iranian species. We provide a new and revised identification key for Niphargus from the Middle East region.

AB Questions: To what extent does habitat similarity across different climatic regions support vegetation similarity at taxonomic, syntaxonomic and functional levels? Do different sand habitats share similarity patterns across regions? To what extent are sand habitats azonal with respect to taxonomic, syntaxonomic and functional similarity? What are the syntaxonomic and functional analogues? Study area: Coastal areas of N Germany, NE Greece, N Iran, and the Namak Lake shore in Central Iran. Methods: In four biogeographic regions (Atlantic, Mediterranean, Hyrcanian, Irano-Turanian) we collected 450 releves representing four habitat types: drift lines, mobile dunes, stabilized dunes, and salt marshes. Plant communities were classified using TWINSPAN and assigned to syntaxa. High-rank syntaxa of each habitat were compared across four regions. Beta diversity was used to compare the species similarity between regions and habitats. We further compared trait-based functional groups across regions and habitats at the syntaxonomic level of class. Results: The floristic composition of sand habitats depended highly on the biogeographic region. At plant species and genus level, very low similarity was found between sand habitats of the same kind across regions as well as across habitats within a region. However, sand habitats of the same kind in different regions showed considerable functional similarity. Vegetation under particularly high stress, such as of salt marshes and drift lines, showed more syntaxonomic and functional similarities between regions than that of mobile and stabilized dunes, which was more determined by the regional species pool. Conclusions: The more stress-prone a habitat, the more is its vegetation habitat related and the less dependent on the biogeographic region. All studied habitats are azonal but nuances are recognizable, and the concept of azonality is more generally applicable using functional traits as parameter. We further suggest using functional group proportions as a complementary tool to diagnostic species when comparing biogeographically distant, vicariant plant communities.

AB Background and aims - The spread of invasive exotic species is one of the most important threats for salt marshes and cordgrasses (genus Spartina) are among the most invasive halophytes. Recent analyses have revealed low levels of genetic diversity within the European cordgrass Spartina patens, clarifying that it was introduced from a narrow genetic pool of plants from North America. As biomass and intratussock structure are key functional traits in the ecological behaviour of cordgrasses, our aim was to document this here for the first time in Spartina patens in Europe.
   Methods - This work analyses above- and below-ground biomass and intratussock structure for two Spartina patens populations in Southern Spain in the two main invaded habitats in Europe, coastal dunes and brackish marshes.
   Key results - Spartina patens showed higher above-ground biomass and higher above: below-ground biomass ratio in the brackish marsh than on the coastal dunes due to higher live shoot densities with similar shoot heights. Sexual reproduction of Spartina patens was very limited in both studied populations since only a few inflorescences were recorded in just one tussock in the marsh.
   Conclusions - Our results for introduced Spartina patens in Spain are compared with those recorded for cohabiting cordgrasses, the native European Spartina maritima and the invasive Spartina densiflora, as well as with Spartina patens in North American marshes. Spartina patens appears as a species with moderate invasive potential in European coastal marshes and dunes since it shows very low sexual reproduction but a high phenotypic plasticity, which would support its invasive capacity. Eradication efforts are most cost effective in the early stage of infestation, when population sizes are still relatively small, and should thus be a focus of the control efforts of S. patens in the Southwest Iberian Peninsula as well as in other European areas, where this cordgrass is still not very abundant.

AB The limiting similarity theory predicts that divergence in the functional traits of native and introduced species is an essential component in species establishment, as introduced species must occupy a niche that is unoccupied by resident species. On the other hand, the environmental filtering hypothesis predicts convergence between introduced and native species, as both possess traits that make them adapted to the local abiotic environment. Morphology, spatial co-occurrence, diet, feeding selectivity, and niche breadth and overlap of Erythrinidae were evaluated to detect possible mechanisms acting in the coexistence between non-native and native species. Native (Hoplias sp. B and Hoplias cf. malabaricus) and non-native (Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus and Hoplias mbigua) species presented differences in morphological traits, spatial co-occurrence, diet, selectivity, and niche breadth and overlap. The mechanisms mediating species coexistence seem to vary according to species. The absence of spatial and feeding overlap suggests that non-native species H. unitaeniatus occupy a different niche than native species, supporting its successful establishment without eliminating the native species. However, low feeding overlap and similar morphologies between non-native and native species of Hoplias point to environmental filters; in this case, the non-native H. mbigua is able to establish due to similarities in functional traits.

AB Benthic macroinvertebrate communities form the basis of the intricate lagoonal food web. Understanding their functional and taxonomic response, from a beta-diversity perspective, is essential to disclose underlying patterns with potential applicability in conservation and management actions. Within the central lagoon of Messolonghi, we studied the main environmental components structuring the macroinvertebrate community. We analyzed the beta-taxonomic and beta-functional diversity across the main habitats and seasons, over a year time frame. Our results outline habitat type and vegetation biomass as the major factors structuring the communities. We found environmental variability to have a positive correlation with functional beta-diversity; however, no correlation was found with taxonomic a-diversity.
   Across the seasons, an asynchronous response of the functional and taxonomic beta-diversity was identified. The taxonomic composition displayed significant heterogeneity during the driest period and the functional composition during the rainy season. Across the habitats, the unvegetated ones presented higher taxonomic homogeneity and functional heterogeneity, contrary to the vegetated habitats that present higher taxonomic variability and functional homogeneity. Across the seasons and habitats, a pattern of functional redundancy and taxonomic replacement was identified. Moreover, high functional turnover versus low taxonomic turnover was documented in an anthropogenic organically enriched habitat
   We conclude that habitats display independent functional and taxonomic seasonal patterns and, thus, different processes may contribute to their variability. The framework presented here highlights the importance of studying both a-diversity components framed in a multi-scale approach for a better understanding of ecological processes and variability patterns. These results are importantfor understanding macroinvertebrate community assembly processes and are valuable for conservation purposes.

AB The renewed interest in trait-based approaches has offered a stimulating, conceptual framework for predicting species distributions, assessing community composition and determining biodiversity-ecosystem linkages. However, despite previous attempts to clarify trait terminology and its application, selecting ecologically meaningful traits that mechanistically link levels of biological organization remains a challenge in aquatic ecology. Response traits can be used to capture community assembly processes along environmental gradients, while effect traits hold the potential to predict ecosystem functions. Although effect traits related to organismal physiology and body composition best allow for extrapolation from individuals to ecosystem processes, such traits are still rarely incorporated within plankton functional approaches or classifications for numerous reasons. Synthesizing current knowledge on effect traits in zooplankton, we call for a better implementation of such metrics as descriptors of community structure. We then capitalize on concepts of bioenergetics and ecosystem ecology to propose a hierarchical framework for zooplankton trait classification, identifying key traits fulfilling organismal functions and linking these to ecosystem processes likely to be influenced. Our framework provides insight regarding trait trade-offs, with implications for feedbacks to ecosystems, aiming to bridge the gap between plankton community ecology and aquatic biogeochemistry.

AB The Indice de Polluo-Sensibilite Specifique (IPS) is one of the most frequently used diatom indexes. However, according to some studies on streams and small rivers, the diatom ecological guilds might be more effective tools for ecological quality assessment in the future, but their usability is not always clear. Our main goal was to compare the robustness of the IPS index and diatom ecological guilds in a large river. For this: i) a temporary study was carried out to investigate if there were some differences between how the nutrient content affected the IPS values and guild proportions in the Danube River; ii) spatial studies were conducted to investigate the effects of the different water depths (different light intensity and current velocity) on biological metrics (such as IPS and guilds); iii) we studied whether the IPS index or guild proportions were influenced more by the substrate type. As for the results of the temporal study, only the motile and planktic guilds had significant connections with phosphate phosphorus concentration. However, the high profile and the low profile taxa showed correlations neither with nutrient concentration nor water discharge. Nevertheless, the higher the abundances of the low profile guild, the lesser the values of the IPS index. In spatial studies, the guild abundances (especially the motile taxa) altered at different water depths. This could be caused by different microhabitats characterised by a disparate current velocity, and by different types of bed material along the cross-section. Contrary to guilds, there were no relevant differences in IPS values along the cross-sections. We experienced similarities in the study on shells and in the spatial study: there were significant differences between guild abundances on different shell surfaces, but not so in the IPS. On the whole, the IPS is robust enough to be a suitable index for ecological water quality assessment, and diatom ecological guilds cannot be used instead of the diatom index (IPS) in large rivers. However, the trait-based methods could be useful supplements to the ecological status assessment.

AB Epiphytic diatom communities from the Dehtaf fishpond (Czech Republic) were studied in terms of species composition, diversity and functional traits. We asked whether variability among samples is determined by sampled substrate (macrophyte species) or location (sampling site). Twenty-one samples of eleven species of vascular plants (predominantly aquatic macrophytes) and one charophyte species were collected at three sites within the fishpond during one sampling event in June 2015. Altogether, 129 diatom taxa were identified. Species richness ranged from 14 to 46 taxa per sample, with the highest richness for Elatine hydropiper and the lowest for Chara braunii. Surprisingly, the representation of typically periphytic taxa (attached to the substrate) was very low, and did not exceed 16 %. Genera typical for epiphyton were present only marginally. The exception was Gomphonema parvulum agg. On the other hand, facultatively periphytic species of the Fragilariales were dominant as well as motile raphid taxa of the Naviculales. Species assemblages at the three sampling sites differed significantly, including the subset of periphytic diatoms. Species composition at the fishpond dam was more represented by typically periphytic taxa, while the other two sites (bays of the Babicky and Dehtafslcy streams) were dominated by facultatively periphytic taxa, mainly Pseudostaurosira elliptica. These differences can be explained by the differences in environmental conditions among the sites, especially very intensive and frequent wave action typical for most parts of the Dehtaf fishpond. However, no significant differences in diatom species composition dependent on the species of sampled plant substrate were found.

AB The invasive white ginger lily (Hedichium coronarium - J. Koenig, 1783) simplifies the trait composition of an insect assemblage in the littoral zone of a Savanna reservoir. Invasive plants are believed to shift the trait composition of aquatic insects dwelling in banks of lentic ecosystems. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the presence of the invasive white ginger lily (H. coronarium) and the functional trait indices of the aquatic insect assemblage in the littoral zone of a tropical reservoir. We sampled aquatic insects on the invaded and non-invaded banks of the reservoir and then analyzed the insect trait indices by estimating the Functional Dispersion (FDis), Functional Evenness (FEve) and the Functional Divergence (FDiv), as well as the Community level Weight-Mean traits (CWM). Finally, we compared these indices between invaded and non-invaded banks as well as their relationship with the abiotic variables, such as dissolved oxygen, pH, depth and water temperature. The result confirmed that the invaded banks had lower values of functional indices as well as dissolved oxygen. However, this abiotic variable was found to have no effect on the functional indices. In addition, the white ginger lily bank presented higher contribution of collector-gathering to predator-piercer groups. We suggest that the invasion of white ginger lily promotes low heterogeneity habitat resulting in simplification on functional traits of aquatic insect assemblage.

AB Environmental filtering and competitive exclusion are hypotheses frequently invoked in explaining species' environmental niches (i.e., geographic distributions). A key assumption in both hypotheses is that the functional niche (i.e., species traits) governs the environmental niche, but few studies have rigorously evaluated this assumption. Furthermore, phylogeny could be associated with these hypotheses if it is predictive of functional niche similarity via phylogenetic signal or convergent evolution, or of environmental niche similarity through phylogenetic attraction or repulsion. The objectives of this study were to investigate relationships between environmental niches, functional niches, and phylogenies of fishes of the Upper (UCRB) and Lower (LCRB) Colorado River Basins of southwestern North America. We predicted that functionally similar species would have similar environmental niches (i.e., environmental filtering) and that closely related species would be functionally similar (i.e., phylogenetic signal) and possess similar environmental niches (i.e., phylogenetic attraction). Environmental niches were quantified using environmental niche modeling, and functional similarity was determined using functional trait data. Nonnatives in the UCRB provided the only support for environmental filtering, which resulted from several warmwater nonnatives having dam number as a common predictor of their distributions, whereas several cool-and coldwater nonnatives shared mean annual air temperature as an important distributional predictor. Phylogenetic signal was supported for both natives and nonnatives in both basins. Lastly, phylogenetic attraction was only supported for native fishes in the LCRB and for nonnative fishes in the UCRB. Our results indicated that functional similarity was heavily influenced by evolutionary history, but that phylogenetic relationships and functional traits may not always predict the environmental distribution of species. However, the similarity of environmental niches among warmwater centrarchids, ictalurids, fundulids, and poeciliids in the UCRB indicated that dam removals could influence the distribution of these nonnatives simultaneously, thus providing greater conservation benefits. However, this same management strategy would have more limited effects on nonnative salmonids, catostomids, and percids with colder temperature preferences, thus necessitating other management strategies to control these species.

AB Flow regulation via impoundments threatens lotic ecosystems and the services they provide globally. Impoundments drastically alter flow and stream temperature variability within fluvial environments, but efforts to quantify ecohydrological and ecothermal responses to flow regulation in conjunction have been sparsely explored to date. This study examined macroinvertebrate community responses to antecedent flow (discharge) and stream temperature variability across paired regulated and non-regulated systems associated with three reservoirs located in adjacent catchments. Community abundances, functional traits, and biomonitoring indices were examined, and ecological differences between non-regulated and regulated sites were quantified, with the most sensitive faunal response being correlated against a suite of flow and thermal indices. Regulated sites exhibited reduced low-flow variability and rapid increases in discharge during peak flows that regularly exceeded those conveyed by non-regulated sites, while stream temperature variability was highly congruent between sites. Macroinvertebrate functional traits were particularly sensitive to flow regulation, and incorporating biomonitoring indices marginally improved the ecological discrimination between regulated and non-regulated sites. Unlike community abundances, functional traits did not vary spatially between catchments, highlighting that such information could guide the implementation of regional environmental flows. Macroinvertebrate communities responded significantly to various hydrological parameters, particularly those associated with the timing of extreme flows, but were less sensitive to thermal controls. Future research should explore ecological responses to antecedent hydrological and stream temperature variability associated with flow regulation to provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving biotic alterations, which could guide future environmental flow methodologies.

AB Functional trait diversity can provide insight into ecosystem function beyond that provided by species diversity measures. The relationship between functional diversity and natural stressors has received less attention compared to anthropogenic stressors. In this study, we investigated how two natural stressors, water salinity and flow intermittence, affect functional richness and functional redundancy of aquatic invertebrate communities using seven biological traits and 39 modalities. For this purpose, we characterized these functional diversity measures in 22 Mediterranean streams with a gradient of natural salinity and flow intermittence. Our findings showed that both functional richness and functional redundancy decreased with increased stress by water salinity and flow intermittence for all the studied traits but more rapidly for the former, suggesting that water salinity is a stronger environmental stressor than flow intermittence. Our study also described an antagonistic interaction of the two study stressors, in which the net effect of both is less than the sum of their independent effects. This study emphasizes that in saline streams, characterized by lower functional richness and functional redundancy, the loss of any taxon can have a huge impact on community functioning. In particular, the functional singularity of saline intermittent streams makes them extremely sensitive to additional anthropogenic impacts. In the context of future global change scenarios, which predict higher flow intermittence and water salinity, this study gives a better understanding of the functional features of these types of ecosystems.

AB It is necessary to understand the resource partitioning among species, to describe the functioning of deep sea marine ecosystems. Functional morphology is an effective approach to understand and compare taxonomic units with different phenotypic characteristics related to swimming and foraging. In this study, our main objective was to delineate the functional traits with a view to determine the discrimination level and degree of functional niche overlap among seven common species inhabiting deep-sea waters in south-eastern Arabian Sea. Results indicated significant differences in the functional traits between species providing a low functional niche overlap. Although, the ecological and biological information of fishes were scarce, we demonstrated that functional analyses are effective to extrapolate the prey preferences, sizes and detection and propulsion efficiencies for their feeding and swimming strategies. Our study supports the hypothesis that in some environments with a limitation of resources, species coexisting is due to high resource partitioning. The present work is a first attempt to compare the morpho-functional characteristics and niche partitioning in the deep-sea fish assemblages from the Indian waters.

AB Monodominant patches of forest dominated by Gilbertiodendron dewevrei are commonly found in central African tropical forests, alongside forests with high species diversity. Although these forests are generally found sparsely distributed along rivers, their occurrence is not thought to be (clearly) driven by edaphic conditions but rather by trait combinations of G. dewevrei that aid in achieving monodominance. Functional community structure between these monodominant and mixed forests has, however, not yet been compared. Additionally, little is known about nondominant species in the monodominant forest community. These two topics are addressed in this study. We investigate the functional community structure of 10 one-hectare plots of monodominant and mixed forests in a central region of the Congo basin, in DR Congo. Thirteen leaf and wood traits are measured, covering 95% (basal area weighted) of all species present in the plots, including leaf nutrient contents, leaf isotopic compositions, specific leaf area, wood density, and vessel anatomy. The trait-based assessment of G. dewevrei shows an ensemble of traits related to water use and transport that could be favorable for its location near forest rivers. Moreover, indications have been found for N and P limitations in the monodominant forest, possibly related to ectomycorrhizal associations formed with G. dewevrei. Reduced leaf N and P contents are found at the community level for the monodominant forest and for different nondominant groups, as compared to those in the mixed forest. In summary, this work shows that environmental filtering does prevail in the monodominant G. dewevrei forest, leading to lower functional diversity in this forest type, with the dominant species showing beneficial traits related to its common riverine locations and with reduced soil N and P availability found in this environment, both coregulating the tree community assembly.

AB While most studies have focused on the timing and nature of ontogenetic niche shifts, information is scarce about the effects of community structure on trophic ontogeny of top predators. We investigated how community structure affects ontogenetic niche shifts (i.e., relationships between body length, trophic position, and individual dietary specialization) of a predatory fish, brown trout (Salmo trutta). We used stable isotope and stomach content analyses to test how functional characteristics of lake fish community compositions (competition and prey availability) modulate niche shifts in terms of (i) piscivorous behavior, (ii) trophic position, and (iii) individual dietary specialization. Northern Scandinavian freshwater fish communities were used as a study system, including nine subarctic lakes with contrasting fish community configurations: (i) trout-only systems, (ii) two-species systems (brown trout and Arctic charr [Salvelinus alpinus] coexisting), and (iii) three-species systems (brown trout, Arctic charr, and three-spined sticklebacks [Gasterosteus aculeatus] coexisting). We expected that the presence of profitable small prey (stickleback) and mixed competitor-prey fish species (charr) supports early piscivory and high individual dietary specialization among trout in multispecies communities, whereas minor ontogenetic shifts were expected in trout-only systems. From logistic regression models, the presence of a suitable prey fish species (stickleback) emerged as the principal variable determining the size at ontogenetic niche shifts. Generalized additive mixed models indicated that fish community structure shaped ontogenetic niche shifts in trout, with the strongest positive relationships between body length, trophic position, and individual dietary specialization being observed in three-species communities. Our findings revealed that the presence of a small-sized prey fish species (stickleback) rather than a mixed competitor-prey fish species (charr) was an important factor affecting the ontogenetic niche-shift processes of trout. The study demonstrates that community structure may modulate the ontogenetic diet trajectories of and individual niche specialization within a top predator.

AB Global warming during the Early Jurassic, and associated widespread ocean deoxygenation, was comparable in scale with the changes projected for the next century. This study quantifies the impact of severe global environmental change on the biological traits of marine communities that define the ecological roles and functions they deliver. We document centennial-millennial variability in the biological trait composition of Early Jurassic (Toarcian) seafloor communities and examine how this changed during the event using biological traits analysis. Environmental changes preceding the global oceanic anoxic event (OAE) produced an ecological shift leading to stressed benthic palaeocommunities with reduced resilience to the subsequent OAE. Changes in traits and ecological succession coincided with major environmental changes; and were of similar nature and magnitude to those in severely deoxygenated benthic communities today despite the very different timescales. Changes in community composition were linked to local redox conditions whereas changes in populations of opportunists were driven by primary productivity. Throughout most of the OAE substitutions by tolerant taxa conserved the trait composition and hence functioning, but periods of severe deoxygenation caused benthic defaunation that would have resulted in functional collapse. Following the OAE recovery was slow probably because the global nature of the event restricted opportunities for recruitment from outside the basin. Our findings suggest that future systems undergoing deoxygenation may initially show functional resilience, but severe global deoxygenation will impact traits and ecosystem functioning and, by limiting the species pool, will slow recovery rates.

AB Despite growing interest in trait-based approaches to community assembly, little attention has been given to seasonal variation in trait distribution patterns. Mobile animals can rapidly mediate influences of environmental factors and species interactions through dispersal, suggesting that the relative importance of different assembly mechanisms can vary over short time scales. This study analyzes seasonal changes in functional trait distributions of tropical fishes in the Xingu River, a major tributary of the Amazon with large predictable temporal variation in hydrologic conditions and species density. Comparison of observed functional diversity revealed that species within wet-season assemblages were more functionally similar than those in dry-season assemblages. Further, species within wet-season assemblages were more similar than random expectations based on null model predictions. Higher functional richness within dry season communities is consistent with increased niche complementarity during the period when fish densities are highest and biotic interactions should be stronger; however, null model tests suggest that stochastic factors or a combination of assembly mechanisms influence dry-season assemblages. These results demonstrate that the relative influence of community assembly mechanisms can vary seasonally in response to changing abiotic conditions, and suggest that studies attempting to infer a single dominant mechanism from functional patterns may overlook important aspects of the assembly process. During the prolonged flood pulse of the wet season, expanded habitat and lower densities of aquatic organisms likely reduce the influence of competition and predation. This temporal shift in the influence of different assembly mechanisms, rather than any single mechanism, may play a large role in maintaining the structure and diversity of tropical rivers and perhaps other dynamic and biodiverse systems.

AB Adaptation to different salinities can drive and maintain divergence between populations of aquatic organisms. Anadromous and stream ecotypes of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are an excellent model to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying osmoregulation divergence. Using a parapatric pair of anadromous and stream stickleback ecotypes, we employed an integrated genomic approach to identify candidate genes important for adaptation to different salinity environments. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of plasma sodium concentrations under a seawater challenge experiment identified a significant QTL on chromosome 16. To identify candidate genes within this QTL, we first conducted RNA-seq and microarray analysis on gill tissue to find ecotypic differences in gene expression that were associated with plasma Na+ levels. This resulted in the identification of ten candidate genes. Quantitative PCR analysis on gill tissue of additional Japanese stickleback populations revealed that the majority of the candidate genes showed parallel divergence in expression levels. Second, we conducted whole-genome sequencing and found five genes that are predicted to have functionally important amino acid substitutions. Finally, we conducted genome scan analysis and found that eight of these candidate genes were located in genomic islands of high differentiation, suggesting that they may be under divergent selection. The candidate genes included those involved in ATP synthesis and hormonal signalling, whose expression or amino acid changes may underlie the variation in salinity tolerance. Further functional molecular analysis of these genes will reveal the causative genetic and genomic changes underlying divergent adaptation.

AB 1. In stream ecology, it has traditionally been proposed that local habitat conditions pose a strong environmental filter resulting in predictable community types. However, recent studies have demonstrated continuous rather than discrete community variation along environmental gradients across streams.
   2. Our aim was to examine the continuity of stream communities using functional traits of benthic macroinvertebrates. Using previous studies and the environmental filtering paradigm as a background, we hypothesised that the taxonomic composition of communities should vary continuously over environmental gradients, whereas the functional composition of communities should form discrete community types according to specific habitat conditions. As stream environmental characteristics vary between seasons, we also asked if this had an effect on the characteristics of community variation in time.
   3. Our data were collected from 50 streams draining into the River Tenojoki (70 degrees N, 27 degrees E) in Finland and Norway. The first data set was collected during late spring 2013 and the second data set during early autumn of the same year. Using multivariate regression trees and constrained ordination methods, we analysed the relationships of taxonomic and functional composition of macroinvertebrate communities to various in-stream environmental factors.
   4. Our results suggest that the variation in the importance of environmental factors between seasons combined with the high heterogeneity of habitats precludes the formation of clear taxonomic and functional community types in northern streams.
   5. Conservation efforts should hence focus on including variability in environmental conditions so as to encompass all components of biological communities. However, as there were some noticeable responses of individual traits to different environmental factors, discrete functional communities may be found if key traits of the organisms can be identified.

AB Functional traits and diversity indices have provided new insights into community responses to stressors. Most traits of aquatic organisms have frequently been tested for predictability and geographical stability in response to environmental variables, but such tests of functional diversity indices are rare. We sampled macroinverte-brates at 18 reference sites (RS) and 35 disturbed sites (DS) from headwater streams in the upper Mekong River Basin, Xishuangbanna (XSBN), China. We selected 29 qualitative categories of eight traits and then calculated five functional diversity indices, namely functional richness (FRic), functional evenness (FEve), functional dispersion (FDis), functional divergence (FDiv) and Rao's Quadratic Entropy (RaoQ), and two trait diversity indices, namely trait richness (TR) and trait diversity (TD). We used combination of RLQand fourth-corner to examine the response of traits and functional diversity to the disturbance and environmental variables. We used variance partitioning to explore the relative role of environmental variables and spatial factors in constraining trait composition and functional diversity. We found that the relative frequency of ten trait categories, and the values of TD, TR, FRic and FDis in RS were significantly different (p < 0.05) from DS. In addition, the seven traits (except for "habit") demonstrated a predictable response of trait patterns along the integrative environmental gradients. Environmental variables significantly contributed to most of the traits, functional diversity and trait diversity. However, spatial variables were mainly significant in shaping ecological traits, FRic and FEve. Our results confirm the dominant role of environmental variables in the determination of community trait composition and functional diversity, and substantiate the contribution of spatial vectors in explaining the variance of functional traits and diversity. We conclude that the traits "Refuge", "External protection", "Respiration" and "Body shape", and diversity indices FDis, TD, and TR are promising indicators of stream conditions at XSBN.

AB Numerous amniote groups adapted to an aquatic life. This change of habitat naturally led to numerous convergences. The various adaptive traits vary depending on the degree of adaptation to an aquatic life, notably between shallow water taxa still able to occasionally locomote on land and open-marine forms totally independent from the terrestrial environment, but also between surface swimmers and deep divers. As a consequence, despite convergences, there is a high diversity within aquatic amniotes in e.g., shape, size, physiology, swimming mode. Bone microanatomy is considered to be strongly associated with bone biomechanics and is thus a powerful tool to understand bone adaptation to functional constraints and to make functional inferences on extinct taxa. Two opposing major microanatomical specializations have been described in aquatic amniotes, referred to as bone mass increase and a spongious organization, respectively. They are assumed to be essentially linked with the hydrostatic or hydrodynamic control of buoyancy and body trim and with swimming abilities and velocity. However, between extremes in these specializations, a wide range of intermediary patterns occurs. The present study provides a state-of-the-art review of these inner bone adaptations in semi-aquatic and aquatic amniotes. The analysis of the various microanatomical patterns observed in long bones, vertebrae, and ribs of a large sample of (semi-) aquatic extant and extinct amniotes reveals the wide diversity in microanatomical patterns and the variation in combination of these different patterns within a single skeleton. This enables us to discuss the link between microanatomical features and habitat, swimming abilities, and thus functional requirements in the context of amniote adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle.

AB Water use efficiency (WUE) is a trait of prime interest in cases of drought stress because it provides information on biomass production in limited water conditions. In order to get information on WUE and additional water use related traits, i.e., dry weight (DW), fresh weight (FW), total leaf water (LW) and leaf water content (WC), greenhouse pot experiments were conducted on 156 barley genotypes (Hordeum vulgare L.) for control (70% maximal water capacity of soil) and drought stress conditions (20% of the maximal water capacity of soil). Significant correlations between WUE and the other water use related traits (r <= 0.65) were determined in juvenile barley, and genotypes suited for improving drought stress tolerance in early developmental stages were identified. Furthermore, based on the significant effects of genotypes and treatments, as well as their interaction, data were used for genome wide association studies (GWAS) resulting in the identification of 14 marker trait associations (MTAs) corresponding to four quantitative trait loci (QTL). For WUE, four MTAs were detected mostly located on barley chromosome 4H. For four MTAs, functional annotations related to the involvement in response to abiotic stress were found. These markers may be of special interest for breeding purposes in cases when they will be validated and also detected in later growth stages.

AB Comprehending functional traits is increasingly recognized as an important element in the investigation of community assembly. We hypothesized that the homogenization effect of floods will lead to trait convergence in flooding periods, while environmental isolation will lead to trait divergence in drought periods. Sampling was carried out during two hydrological periods between 2002 and 2011 in a floodplain lake. The traits considered were taxonomical grouping, origin of the shell material, and presence of gas vacuoles. A functional dispersion index was calculated to detect trait convergence or divergence related to the hydrological periods over time. A redundancy analysis was carried out to investigate how the functional traits of the testate amoebae were linked to environmental variables during the different hydrological periods. We recorded seventy-nine taxa belonging to eight families. The functional index of testate amoebae indicated a predominant pattern of trait convergence in flooding and trait divergence in drought. Our results indicated that hydrological periods influence the functional traits of testate amoebae (indicating those typical of drought and flooding periods), which are strongly influenced by environmental variables related to food resources, especially chlorophyll a.

AB Phenotypic plasticity allows organisms to change their phenotype in response to shifts in the environment. While a central topic in current discussions of evolutionary potential, a comprehensive understanding of the genetic underpinnings of plasticity is lacking in systems undergoing adaptive diversification. Here, we investigate the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity in a textbook adaptive radiation, Lake Malawi cichlid fishes. Specifically, we crossed two divergent species to generate an F3 hybrid mapping population. At early juvenile stages, hybrid families were split and reared in alternate foraging environments that mimicked benthic/scraping or limnetic/sucking modes of feeding. These alternate treatments produced a variation in morphology that was broadly similar to the major axis of divergence among Malawi cichlids, providing support for the flexible stem theory of adaptive radiation. Next, we found that the genetic architecture of several morphological traits was highly sensitive to the environment. In particular, of 22 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL), only one was shared between the environments. In addition, we identified QTL acting across environments with alternate alleles being differentially sensitive to the environment. Thus, our data suggest that while plasticity is largely determined by loci specific to a given environment, it may also be influenced by loci operating across environments. Finally, our mapping data provide evidence for the evolution of plasticity via genetic assimilation at an important regulatory locus, ptch1. In all, our data address long-standing discussions about the genetic basis and evolution of plasticity. They also underscore the importance of the environment in affecting developmental outcomes, genetic architectures, morphological diversity and evolutionary potential.

AB A contemporary challenge in ecology is assessing the ecosystem effects of multispecies introductions. Quantifying shifts in body sizes, a common trait with which many per capita rates of ecosystems functioning scales, provide an important way forward. Evidence suggests that freshwater fish introductions have altered species-level body size distributions globally, but it is difficult to interpret their functional consequences because animals contribute to ecosystem functioning at the individual level at smaller spatial scales. In this study, we determine whether these macroecological patterns hold for individual size distributions (ISDs) at local scales. We use a comprehensive dataset of fish communities in a highly invaded dryland river to (1) compare the statistical moments of ISDs between native and non-native pools and (2) relate biological and environmental covariates to the univariate moments of local ISDs and the multivariate community structure of local fish assemblages. We found that ISDs of native and non-native pools were significantly different when data were pooled across sites. Non-natives had smaller mean body size than natives across all guilds and within invertivore and omnivore guilds, but were significantly larger within the invertivore-piscivore guild. Moreover, differences in the variance of size distributions were often relatively greater than differences in the mean. By modeling ISDs at the site level as a function of biological and environmental covariates, we found that non-native dominance within sites had similar effects on ISDs as expected from differences between species pools. However, neither biological nor environmental predictors explained significant community-level variation when size and trophic structure were considered simultaneously. Shifts in size distributions can have multiple ecological consequences, and our results provide a baseline for generating size-based predictions of non-native species' roles in ecosystem functioning. However, these size-based predictions should be considered alongside other important trait distributions such as trophic structure, which had no consistent relationship with non-native dominance in this study.

AB A genotyping assay for the Ion Torrent Ion PGM platform was developed for fast and cost-effective targeted genotyping of key single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) earlier identified using a genome-wide SNP array in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. The method comprised a simple primer design step for multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by two rounds of Ion Torrent Ion PGM sequencing to empirically evaluate marker efficiency in large multiplexes and to optimise or exclude them when necessary. Of 282 primer pairs initially tested, 217 were successfully amplified, indicating good amplification success (>75%). These markers included the sdy partial gene product to determine genetic sex, as well as three additional modules comprising SNPs for assessing neutral genetic variation (N-SNP = 150), examining functional genetic variation associated with sea age at maturity (N-SNP = 5), and for performing genetic subpopulation assignment (N-SNP = 61). The assay was primarily developed to monitor long-term genetic changes in S. salar from the Teno River, but modules are likely suitable for application in a wide range of S. salar populations. Furthermore, the fast and versatile assay development pipeline offers a strategy for developing targeted sequencing assays in any species. (C) 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

AB Macrophytes are common inhabitants of lotic environments and, depending on their morphological traits, possess adaptations that provide shelter to aquatic invertebrates against strong river flow and predators. They may also be used as a food source by macroinvertebrates. The main goal of this study was to determine the relationship between the red alga Paralemanea mexicana and its role as a shelter and/or food source for lotic macroinvertebrates. We also conducted research on the role of microhabitat and morphological variations of the alga in determining macroinvertebrate taxon abundance, diversity, and functional group composition in a high-current velocity river. Results showed that changes in cover and morphology of P. mexicana were mostly correlated with river current velocity, irradiance, and seasonal variation. In turn, these were related to changes in abundance and diversity of the associated macroinvertebrate community. In addition, six macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups were evaluated for associations with the red alga: filtering and gathering collectors, piercers, scrapers, herbivore shredders, and predators. The results showed that the Trichoptera Hydroptilidae genera Ochrotrichia and Metrichia use P. mexicana as a food source and case-building material. The Trichoptera Glossosomatidae Mortoniella uses the alga as a substrate. The biotic interactions between P. mexicana and associated macroinvertebrates reveal the importance of macrophytes as purveyors of substrate, as food and shelter for macroinvertebrates, and also as promoters of macroinvertebrate community diversity. In addition, it was shown that macroinvertebrate herbivory likely facilitates vegetative propagation of the red alga through increased release and germination of carpospores and new gametophytes.

AB Water scarcity is becoming one of the greatest challenges that human societies will face during this century. Monitoring water availability is expensive and technically challenging. In this regard, biological communities (e.g. aquatic insects) offer a cost-effective alternative, since they integrate temporal and spatial hydrological variability.
   Here we explore the potential of Chironomidae (Diptera), which have been usually neglected due to their complex taxonomy, as indicators of both local habitat condition and water scarcity. The study took place in 28 sites across seven dryland streams distributed within a 400 km(2) section of the Upper San Pedro River basin, southeastern Arizona. The selected streams covered a wide range of hydrological variability, which was continuously measured through the deployment of 15 electrical resistance (ER) sensors. Chironomidae taxa with no drought-resistance strategies were rarely found in streams that experienced frequent drying events (i.e. intermittent and ephemeral streams), suggesting that droughts have the potential to reduce species richness due to local extinctions of drought-intolerant taxa. Intermittent and ephemeral streams registered low canopy cover and a significantly higher abundance of scrapers (which mainly feed on algae) and shredders (feeding on poorly decomposed coarse organic material). This suggests that structural changes associated to drought (e.g. reduced canopy cover and decomposition rates) might lead to changes in the functional composition of the Chironomidae assemblages. We conclude that Chironomidae species can be used as indicators of hydrological variability and the impacts of drought on streams in the absence of flow gauges. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effects of metal contamination on estuarine macrobenthic communities were investigated using the Biological Traits Analysis (BTA). The study was carried out in the Tagus estuary (western Portugal). Samples of macrobenthic communities and associated environmental variables were taken in four surveys (September 2012, and February, May and October 2013) across the contamination gradient from three main zones: a slightly contaminated, a moderately contaminated and a highly contaminated zone. Functional traits for the most abundant species were assigned using seven categories based on "Feeding mode", "Life span", "Body size", "Motility", "Position in sediments", "Larval type" and "AMBI ecological group". To investigate whether the macroinvertebrate community structure was associated with the environmental parameters and biological traits an integrative multivariate analysis, combining the RLQ analysis and the fourth-corner method, was applied. Within this analysis, human-induced estuarine variables (metals) were rendered independent from natural ones (sediment fine particles) through partial correlations. Following this approach, it was possible to decouple the effects of two typically highly correlated environmental descriptors with different origins. Overall, the study identified significant relationships between sediment environmental descriptors and the functional traits of macrobenthic communities. Further, RLQ/Fourth-corner combined analysis successfully isolated the traits and corresponding species that were most correlated with the measured concentration of trace metals in sediments, supporting the knowledge that benthic organisms exhibit distinct responses to different levels of disturbance. A shift in species dominance occurred along the contamination gradient with epifaunal tolerant species with very small size, long life span, and crawling motility dominating the highest contaminated area. This area was also related with surface deposit-feeder species. The most representative species associated with this area was the gastropod Peringia ulvae. Less contaminated sites revealed large-sized specimens, carnivores and swimmers, mainly represented by the polychaete Nephtys hombergii. This finding is consistent with other studies addressing different kinds of disturbance, where a shift in dominance from carnivore/predators, long-lived and large animals to the predominance of small-size, short-lived and deposit-feeders has been observed across increasing gradients of disturbance. Our results reinforce the importance of macrobenthic functional traits analysis to assess human disturbances driven impacts in multi-stressed estuarine ecosystems. By analysing the environmental variables with different origins independently, we were able to draw conclusions about the effects of human pressures (metals) on macrobenthic traits. Such distinction can be particularly useful to isolate different environmental descriptors and assess their effects on functional diversity, making the current approach promising in evaluation the ecological effects of anthropogenic stressors in estuarine areas.

AB Conservation of life history variation is an important consideration for many species with trade-offs in migratory characteristics. Many salmonid species exhibit both resident and migratory strategies that capitalize on benefits in freshwater and marine environments. In this study, we investigated genomic signatures for migratory life history in collections of resident and anadromous Oncorhynchus nerka (Kokanee and Sockeye Salmon, respectively) from two lake systems, using similar to 2,600 SNPs from restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). Differing demographic histories were evident in the two systems where one pair was significantly differentiated (Redfish Lake, F-ST=0.091 [95% confidence interval: 0.087 to 0.095]) but the other pair was not (Alturas Lake, F-ST=-0.007 [-0.008 to -0.006]). Outlier and association analyses identified several candidate markers in each population pair, but there was limited evidence for parallel signatures of genomic variation associated with migration. Despite lack of evidence for consistent markers associated with migratory life history in this species, candidate markers were mapped to functional genes and provide evidence for adaptive genetic variation within each lake system. Life history variation has been maintained in these nearly extirpated populations of O. nerka, and conservation efforts to preserve this diversity are important for long-term resiliency of this species.

AB Most studies on riverine ground beetle assemblages last 1-2 years, and studies on carabids from lowland stream ecosystems are rare. In 1999, a 16-year study was launched to gain insight into the structure and diversity of carabid assemblages in a cross-section of four habitats located beside a 5 m wide stream: Meadow (wet meadow), Clumps (meadow scattered with birch and willow clumps farther from the river), Birch (birch stand), and Pine (pine stand located the farthest from the stream). The total number of 14, 216 individuals representing 118 carabid species were collected. Eleven functional carabid groups have been analysed. Principal response curve analysis showed significant differences existing during the whole study period among carabid assemblages from the four habitats. Generalised Linear Mixed Models analysis revealed a dependence of Chao2 estimator performance on temperature and ground water level, whereas life traits of carabids depended solely on the latter factor, affecting species composition (i.e., proportions of autumn and spring breeders, large and small zoophages, hemizoophages, forest, generalists and open area species, wingless species, hygrophilous, mesophilous and xerophilous species). The lower the ground water level, the higher was the proportion of late-successional species. Both Chao2 value and the proportion of late-successional species were growing with the increasing distance from the stream, peaking in the Pine habitat. Early-successional fauna dominated in streamside assemblages. IndVal analysis identified 1-9 characteristic species for each habitat type, mostly non-recurrent during the study period. Thus, species composition of riverine carabid assemblages should be studied for longer periods than 1-2 years to avoid accidental observations.

AB Local distribution of stream insects is influenced by abiotic factors, such as substrate heterogeneity and amount of organic matter. We evaluated the influence of substrate heterogeneity on the functional structure and diversity of stream macroinvertebrate communities based on 4 traits: feeding habits, body size, body shape, and attachment to substrate. Heterogeneous substrate supported communities with higher functional diversity and richness than did homogeneous substrate. In addition, communities on heterogeneous substrate had more predators, shredders, filterer-collectors, and organisms with a large body size than did homogeneous substrate. In contrast, communities on homogeneous substrate had predominantly small organisms, case-builders, and scrapers. Our results suggest that in natural habitats, substrate heterogeneity selects specific combinations of traits especially related to size and feeding habit, which have strong implications for stream ecosystem functioning. As a result, one may anticipate that homogenization of stream bottom substrate associated with human activities should result in a reduction or loss of important functions linked, e.g., to the processing of organic matter, which should greatly affect the stream ecosystem.

AB Context: Multiple stressors constitute a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems, particularly in the Mediterranean region where water scarcity is likely to interact with other anthropogenic stressors. Biological traits potentially allow the unravelling of the effects of multiple stressors. However, thus far, trait-based approaches have failed to fully deliver on their promise and still lack strong predictive power when multiple stressors are present.
   Goal: We aimed to quantify specific community tolerances against six anthropogenic stressors and investigate the responses of the underlying macroinvertebrate biological traits and their combinations.
   Methods: We built and calibrated boosted regression tree models to predict community tolerances using multiple biological traits with a priori hypotheses regarding their individual responses to specific stressors. We analysed the combinations of traits underlying community tolerance and the effect of trait association on this tolerance.
   Results: Our results validated the following three hypotheses: (i) the community tolerance models efficiently and robustly related trait combinations to stressor intensities and, to a lesser extent, to stressors related to the presence of dams and insecticides; (ii) the effects of traits on community tolerance not only depended on trait identity but also on the trait associations emerging at the community level from the co-occurrence of different traits in species; and (iii) the community tolerances and the underlying trait combinations were specific to the different stressors.
   Conclusion: This study takes a further step towards predictive tools in community ecology that consider combinations and associations of traits as the basis of stressor tolerance. Additionally, the community tolerance concept has potential application to help stream managers in the decision process regarding management options. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Water scarcity is an expanding climate and human related condition, which drives and interacts with other stressors in freshwater ecosystems such as chemical pollution. In this study we provide an overview of the existing knowledge regarding the chemical fate, biological dynamics and the ecological risks of chemicals underwater scarcity conditions. We evaluated a total of 15 studies dealing with the combined effects of chemicals and water scarcity under laboratory conditions and in the field. The results of these studies have been elaborated in order to evaluate additive, synergistic or antagonistic responses of the studied endpoints. As a general rule, it can be concluded that, in situations of water scarcity, the impacts of extreme water fluctuations are much more relevant than those of an additional chemical stressor. Nevertheless, the presence of chemical pollution may result in exacerbated ecological risks in some particular cases. We conclude that further investigations on this topic would take advantage on the focus on some specific issues. Experimental (laboratory and model ecosystem) studies should be performed on different biota groups and life stages (diapausing eggs, immature stages), with particular attention to those including traits relevant for the adaptation to water scarcity. More knowledge on species adaptations and recovery capacity is essential to predict community responses to multiple stressors and to assess the community vulnerability. Field studies should be performed at different scales, particularly in lotic systems, in order to integrate different functional dynamics of the river ecosystem. Combining field monitoring and experimental studies would be the best option to reach more conclusive, causal relationships on the effects of co-occurring stressors. Contribution of these studies to develop ecological models and scenarios is also suggested as an improvement for the prospective aquatic risk assessment of chemicals in (semi-) arid areas.

AB Three genetically discrete morphs of Arctic charr in Loch Rannoch, Scotland originated from a recent divergence within the lake (in situ) (piscivore and benthivore morphs) and from secondary contact of two older lineages (ex situ; a planktivore-piscivore/benthivore divergence). To test if the expression of traits with strong functional roles was linked to the age of the divergence, fin and gill anatomy, and dentition were quantified and compared across morphs. Five additional working hypotheses suggesting a rank order of trait expression amongst morphs were also tested. The planktivorous morph had more rays in the dorsal and pectoral fins, longer gill rakers (but not more) as well as a smaller gill cavity than the other two morphs. The piscivorous morph had more palatine teeth and longer teeth on the mandible, pre-maxillary and glossohyal bones, and a larger buccal cavity. These differences indicate a differential response to selection in these functional anatomical features most likely related to morph foraging specialisms. Notably, between-morph divergences in the expression of these traits were not simply linked to the length of divergence between morphs and have arisen equally quickly in the recent (in situ) divergence as they have in older, ex situ divergences.

AB Soil loss from an 8% sloping Teff field in north-western Ethiopia is significant (similar to 70 t ha(-1) yr(-1)), and thus found to be an important source of sediment. Grass barriers showing sediment trapping efficacy (STE) are important measures in trapping sediment inside Teff fields and protecting downstream reservoirs and lakes from sedimentation. There are many indigenous grass species available that have the potential to act as sediment trapping measure when used in strips downstream of sloping crop fields. However, their STE and their key functional traits that determine their STE are not yet known. This negatively influence agricultural extension agents in disseminating conservation technology to farmers at larger scales. The indigenous grass species Desho (Pennisetum pedicellatum), Senbelet (Hyparrhenia rufa), Sebez (Pennisetum schimpri) and Akirma (Eleusine flocafolia) and one exotic species, Vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides) were tested for two years (2013 and 2014) in 1.5 m wide strips below Teff fields at 8% slope in the Debre Mewi watershed, northwest Ethiopia. The average runoff during the study was 79, 64, 69, 71, 74 and 75 I m(-2), with 7.0, 1.7, 2.9, 3.6, 4.5 and 5.6 kg m(-2) yr(-1) of sediment from the Control, Desho, Vetiver, Senbelet, Akirma and Sebez treatments, respectively. Differences in key functional traits affected the STE of the different grass barriers. Desho with the highest tiller number and density, and the second highest root length (depth) showed better STE (76%) than,the other grass species, Vetiver (59%), Senbelet (49%), Akirma (36%) and Sebez (20%). This indicates that grass barriers can be used as a soil conservation measure replacing the costly and more maintenance demanding physical structures like trenches and ridges. As a co-benefit, grass barriers provided important fresh biomass for livestock, thereby helping to reduce the feed shortage. Thus we conclude that indigenous grass species provided a practical means to reduce soil loss from Teff fields (up to 8% slope) in the northwest Ethiopia and can be easily adopted by farmers due to their combined soil conservation and feed value.

AB The study included fresh pork semimembranosus (SM, n = 289) and triceps brachii (TB, n = 283) muscles sourced from meat packers of Mexico and the USA. Samples were analyzed for moisture, protein, and fat content, pH, shear force (WBSF), cook loss, water holding capacity (WHC), instrumental color, emulsion capacity (EC) and stability (ES), and consumer sensory ratings. SM from the USA had lower WBSF (P < 0.05) than that from Mexico (26.7 vs. 29.7 N), higher WHC (44.7 vs. 38.4%; P < 0.05) and a better appearance, as indicated by its lower h* (52.3 vs. 56.6; P < 0.05) and higher C* (23.1 vs. 21.3; P < 0.05). Consumer acceptance of SM was similar (P > 0.05) across countries. TB from Mexico had higher (P < 0.05) fat content (2.5 vs. 2.0%), lower (P < 0.05) WBSF values (32.0 vs. 36.9 N), and received more positive ratings by Mexican consumers (87.1 vs. 81.7%) than its US equivalent. In general, US pork exhibits better technological properties, while country of origin has less effect on consumer acceptability. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Improvement in the performance of eukaryotic microalgae for biofuel and bioproduct production is largely dependent on characterization of metabolic mechanisms within the cell. The marine diatom Cyclotella cryptica, which was originally identified in the Aquatic Species Program, is a promising strain of microalgae for large-scale production of biofuel and bioproducts, such as omega-3 fatty acids.
   Results: We sequenced the nuclear genome and methylome of this oleaginous diatom to identify the genetic traits that enable substantial accumulation of triacylglycerol. The genome is comprised of highly methylated repetitive sequence, which does not significantly change under silicon starved lipid induction, and data further suggests the primary role of DNA methylation is to suppress DNA transposition. Annotation of pivotal glycolytic, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate degradation processes reveal an expanded enzyme repertoire in C. cryptica that would allow for an increased metabolic capacity toward triacylglycerol production. Identification of previously unidentified genes, including those involved in carbon transport and chitin metabolism, provide potential targets for genetic manipulation of carbon flux to further increase its lipid phenotype. New genetic tools were developed, bringing this organism on a par with other microalgae in terms of genetic manipulation and characterization approaches.6
   Conclusions: Functional annotation and detailed cross-species comparison of key carbon rich processes in C. cryptica highlights the importance of enzymatic subcellular compartmentation for regulation of carbon flux, which is often overlooked in photosynthetic microeukaryotes. The availability of the genome sequence, as well as advanced genetic manipulation tools enable further development of this organism for deployment in large-scale production systems.

AB The Critical Zone is defined as the thin, permeable layer from the tops of the trees to the bottom of the bedrock that sustains terrestrial life on Earth. The geometry and shape of the various weathering zones are known as the critical zone architecture. At the centre of the Critical Zone are soils and the microorganisms that inhabit them. In Western Australia, the million-year-old stable weathering history and more recent lateral erosion during the past hundreds of thousands of years have created a geomorphic setting where deep weathering zones are now exposed on the surface along the flanks of many lateritic hills. These old weathering zones provide diverse physical and chemical properties that influence near surface pedologic conditions and thus likely shape current surface microbiology. Here, we present data derived from a small lateritic hill on the UWA Farm Ridgefield. Spatial soil sampling revealed the contrasting distribution patterns of simple soil parameters such as pH (CaCl2) and electric conductivity. These are clearly linked with underlying changes of the critical zone architecture and show a strong contrast with low values of pH 3.3 at the top of the hill to pH 5.3 at the bottom. These parameters were identified as major drivers of microbial spatial variability in terms of bacterial and archaeal community composition but not abundance. In addition, we used sensitive C-14 labelling to assess tumover of three model organic nitrogen compounds - an important biogeochemical functional trait relating to nutrient availability. Though generally rapid and in the order of rates reported elsewhere (t(1/2) < 5 h), some points in the sampling area showed greatly reduced turnover rates (t(1/2) > 10 h). In conclusion, we have shown that the weathering and erosion history of ancient Western Australia affects the surface pedology and has consequences for microbial community structure and function.

AB Biological assemblages are constantly undergoing change, with species being introduced, extirpated and experiencing shifts in their densities. Theory and experimentation suggest that the impacts of such change on ecosystem functioning should be predictable based on the biological traits of the species involved. However, interspecific interactions could alter how species affect functioning, with the strength and sign of interactions potentially depending on environmental context (e.g. homogenous vs. heterogeneous conditions) and the function considered. Here, we assessed how concurrent changes to the densities of two common marine benthic invertebrates, Corophium volutator and Hediste diversicolor, affected the ecological functions of organic matter consumption and benthic-pelagic nutrient flux. Complementary experiments were conducted within homogenous laboratory microcosms and naturally heterogeneous field plots. When the densities of the species were increased within microcosms, interspecific interactions enhanced effects on organic matter consumption and reduced effects on nutrient flux. Trait-based predictions of how each species would affect functioning were only consistently supported when the density of the other species was low. In field plots, increasing the density of either species had a positive effect on organic matter consumption (with no significant interspecific interactions) but no effect on nutrient flux. Our results indicate that species-specific effects on ecosystem functioning can be altered by interspecific interactions, which can be either facilitative (positive) or antagonistic (negative) depending on the function considered. The impacts of biodiversity change may therefore not be predictable based solely on the biological traits of the species involved. Possible explanations for why interactions were detected in microcosms but not in the field are discussed.

AB Background and aims - Functional patterns and the environmental influence over species traits are important tools for the conservation of riparian forests. Richness, diversity and functional structure of the epiphytic vascular spore-producing plant community (ferns and lycophytes) were studied and compared at the superior (site 1), middle (site 2) and inferior (site 3) parts of Sinos River, which is one of the most important and impacted rivers in southern Brazil. We tested the hypotheses that functional patterns of epiphytic vascular spore-producing plant assemblages differ among sites; that richness, canopy openness, density, and tree basal area influence the epiphytic functional structure and that functional traits that favor species tolerance to water deficit will be more abundant in areas with simplified surrounding vegetation structure.
   Methods - All ferns and lycophyte species were recorded on 120 phorophytes (forty at each site). In order to compare environmental differences among sites we used the vegetation parameters taken at each sampling unit. For the functional analyses we used traits related to the ecological category, life form, leaf dimorphism, leaf division, position of leaves, presence and amount of leaf trichomes or scales and the presence of succulent rhizome.
   Key results - A total of 32 epiphytic species of vascular spore-producing plants were surveyed. The majority of species recorded were holoepiphytes, had a creeping rhizome, and monomorphic, divided and erect leaves. Functional diversity, species diversity and functional redundancy were higher at site 1. The two other sites were statistically equivalent regarding these parameters. At site 1, phorophytes had the highest species richness and the vegetation as a whole showed a higher density and total basal area.
   Conclusions - We observed that functional structure and richness of epiphytic vascular spore-producing plants change according to the forest stand structure, highlighting the importance of preserving the riparian forest at site 1 and the need for restoration measures at sites 2 and 3.

AB Within the last century, the floristic composition of riparian communities in the Southwest has drastically changed following introduction of the exotic tree Tamarix ramosissima. In an attempt to control Tamarix populations, the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda carinulata) has been utilized as a biological control agent. Three years of data collection at our study sites along Fountain Creek (Fountain, CO) allowed us to characterize the response of Tamarix to invasion by the biological control agent. In analyzing data collected before, during, and after the beetle invasion, we observed a significant effect of foliar herbivory on Tamarix physiology and life history strategy. Associations between flower number and functional traits changed before, during, and after the beetle invasion. Before the invasion, reproductively fit individuals exhibited high stomatal conductance and used relatively more water. During and after the invasion, fit plants had higher foliar chlorophyll content, but conductance was not significantly correlated with fecundity. Tamarix responded to defoliation by increasing water use, which may have been an attempt to sustain photosynthate allocation to reproductive structures. Therefore, the leaf beetle may increase the water use of Tamarix during the growing season.

AB MON 87411 maize, which expresses DvSnf7 RNA, was developed to provide an additional mode of action to confer protection against corn rootworm (Diabrotica spp.). A critical step in the registration of a genetically engineered crop with an insecticidal trait is performing an ecological risk assessment to evaluate the potential for adverse ecological effects. For MON 87411, an assessment plan was developed that met specific protection goals by characterizing the routes and levels of exposure, and testing representative functional taxa that would be directly or indirectly exposed in the environment. The potential for toxicity of DvSnf7 RNA was evaluated with a harmonized battery of non-target organisms (NTOs) that included invertebrate predators, parasitoids, pollinators, soil biota as well as aquatic and terrestrial vertebrate species. Laboratory tests evaluated ecologically relevant endpoints such as survival, growth, development, and reproduction and were of sufficient duration to assess the potential for adverse effects. No adverse effects were observed with any species tested at, or above, the maximum expected environmental concentration (MEEC). All margins of exposure for NTOs were >10-fold the MEEC. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that exposure to DvSnf7 RNA, both directly and indirectly, is safe for NTOs at the expected field exposure levels. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

AB Stream restoration practice typically relies on a geomorphological design approach in which the integration of ecological criteria is limited and generally qualitative, although the most commonly stated project objective is to restore biological integrity by enhancing habitat and water quality. Restoration has achieved mixed results in terms of ecological successes and it is evident that improved methodologies for assessment and design are needed. A design approach is suggested for mesohabitat restoration based on a review and integration of fundamental processes associated with: (1) lotic ecological concepts; (2) applied geomorphic processes for mesohabitat self-maintenance; (3) multidimensional hydraulics and habitat suitability modeling; (4) species functional traits correlated with fish mesohabitat use; and (5) multi-stage ecohydraulics-based mesohabitat classification. Classification of mesohabitat units demonstrated in this article were based on fish preferences specifically linked to functional trait strategies (i.e., feeding resting, evasion, spawning, and flow refugia), recognizing that habitat preferences shift by season and flow stage. A multi-stage classification scheme developed under this premise provides the basic "building blocks" for ecological design criteria for stream restoration. The scheme was developed for Midwest US prairie streams, but the conceptual framework for mesohabitat classification and functional traits analysis can be applied to other ecoregions.

AB Phenotypic plasticity in macrophytes is observed when morphological and physiological features respond to environmental variation, and a trade-off is observed when there is investment in a specific feature to the detriment of another. We investigated causes for the trade-off in leaf and root investment in Eichhornia azurea, a macrophyte of major importance in structuring ecosystems in a large Neotropical floodplain. At riverine systems, the leaf/root ratio of E. azurea is typically related to different environmental conditions. We hypothesized that the trade-off between leaf and root investment would depend on water flow and water renewal. Our results indicated that, in lentic ecosystems, the investment in roots was higher than in leaves when compared to semi-lotic ecosystems. This result was probably explained due to the poor nutrient availability as a consequence of low water flow in lentic ecosystems. In semi-lotic ecosystems, instead, nutrient absorption may be higher, favoring high leaf investment. Indeed, when this trade-off is compared between lentic habitats with different water exchanges, investment in leaves is higher in habitats with higher water exchange, and consequently with a constant renewal in nutrient availability.

AB Aims: Concentrated flow erosion resistance of herbaceous vegetation is linked to vegetation-level root length density (RLD). However, RLD measurements involve destructive and time-consuming sampling. Since plant species richness, functional diversity and functional composition are expected to affect RLD through either non-additive diversity effects or biomass ratio effects, we evaluated whether these measures can be used as a proxy for RLD in levee grassland communities.
   Location: Levee grassland communities, Scheldt estuary, northern Belgium.
   Methods: We assessed the strength of correlation between empirically quantified RLD and species richness, functional diversity and functional composition of levee grasslands. More specifically, we used nine below-ground and ten above-ground plant traits retrieved from public databases, and applied linear regressions and partial least square regressions.
   Results: Plant functional diversity was a better proxy for RLD than plant species richness, with better predictive performance for below-ground than for above-ground traits. More specifically, the highest predictive power was achieved through integration of functional diversity, functional composition and species richness. This suggests that variation in RLD is driven by a combination of both non-additive diversity effects and biomass ratio effects.
   Conclusions: This study provides a first positive indication of the value of plant functional traits retrieved from databases to predict RLD for river levee grasslands. Furthermore, although less reliable than below-ground traits, above-ground traits are still useful for RLD prediction when information on below-ground traits is lacking.

AB Populus euphratica is an important native tree found in arid regions from North Africa and South Europe to China, and is known to tolerate many forms of environmental stress, including drought. We describe cuticle waxes, cutin and cuticle permeability for the heteromorphic leaves of P. euphratica growing in two riparian habitats that differ in available soil moisture. Scanning electron microscopy revealed variation in epicuticular wax crystallization associated with leaf type and site. P. euphratica leaves are dominated by cuticular wax alkanes, primary-alcohols and fatty acids. The major cutin monomers were 10,16-diOH C-16:0 acids. Broad-ovate leaves (associated with adult phase growth) produced 1.3- and 1.6-fold more waxes, and 2.1- and 0.9-fold more cutin monomers, than lanceolate leaves (associated with juvenile phase growth) at the wetter site and drier site, respectively. The alkane-synthesis-associated ECERIFERUM1 (CER1), as well as ABC transporter- and elongase-associated genes, were expressed at much higher levels at the drier than wetter sites, indicating their potential function in elevating leaf cuticle lipids in the dry site conditions. Higher cuticle lipid amounts were closely associated with lower cuticle permeability (both chlorophyll efflux and water loss). Our results implicate cuticle lipids as among the xeromorphic traits associated with P. euphratica adult-phase broad-ovate leaves. Results here provide useful information for protecting natural populations of P. euphratica and their associated ecosystems, and shed new light on the functional interaction of cuticle and leaf heterophylly in adaptation to more arid, limited-moisture environments.

AB Predicted climate change and the associated sea level rise poses an increased threat of flooding due to wave overtopping events at sea and river dikes. To safeguard the land from flooding it is important to keep the soil erosion resistance at the dikes high. As plant roots can be very effective in reducing soil erosion rates by concentrated flow, the main goal of this study is to explore the variability in root system characteristics of five dike vegetation communities along the Scheldt River (Belgium) and to assess their effectiveness in controlling soil erosion rates during concentrated flow. This study is the first one to investigate systematically the erosion-reducing potential of the root properties of representative dike vegetation communities in a temperate humid climate. Results show that the presence of Urtica dioica resulted in large differences in root length density (RLD) among dike vegetation communities. Observed RLD values in the topsoil ranged from 129 to 235kmm(-3) for dike vegetation communities without U. dioica, while smaller values ranging from 22 to 58kmm(-3) were found for vegetation communities with U. dioica. The erosion-reducing effect of the dike vegetation communities was estimated based on a global Hill curve model, linking the RLD to the soil detachment ratio (SDR; i.e. the ratio of the soil detachment rate for root-permeated topsoils to the soil detachment rate for root-free topsoils). Concentrated flow erosion rates are likely to be reduced to 13-16% of the erosion rates for root-free topsoils if U. dioica is absent compared to 22-30% for vegetation communities with U. dioica. Hence, to maintain a high resistance of the soil against concentrated flow erosion it is important to avoid the overgrowth of grassland by U. dioica through an effective vegetation management.

AB The fossorial amphisbaenians, or worm lizards, are characterized by a suite of specialized characters in the skull and postcranium, however fossil evidence suggests that at least some of these shared derived traits evolved convergently. Unfortunately the lack of detailed knowledge of many fossil taxa has rendered a more precise interpretation difficult. Here we describe the cranial anatomy of the oldest-known well-preserved amphisbaenian, Spathorhynchus fossorium, from the Eocene Green River Formation, Wyoming, USA, using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (HRXCT). This taxon possesses one of the most strongly reinforced crania known among amphisbaenians, with many dermal bones overlapping each other internally. In contrast to modern taxa, S.fossorium has a paired orbitosphenoid, lacks a true compound bone in the mandible, and possesses a fully enclosed orbital rim. The last feature represents a highly derived structure in that the jugal establishes contact with the frontal internally, reinforcing the posterior orbital margin. S.fossorium also possesses a strongly modified Vidian canal with a previously unknown connection to the ventral surface of the parabasisphenoid. Comparison with the closely related fossil taxon Dyticonastis rensbergeri reveals that these derived traits are also shared by the latter species and potentially represent synapopmorphies of an extinct Paleogene clade of amphisbaenians. The presence of a reinforced orbital rim suggests selection against the loss of a functional eye and indicates an ecology potentially different from modern taxa. Given the currently accepted phylogenetic position of Spathorhynchus and Dyticonastis, we predict that supposedly unique' cranial traits traditionally linked to fossoriality such as a fused orbitosphenoid and the reduction of the eye show a more complex character history than previously assumed, including both parallel evolution and reversals to superficially primitive conditions.

AB The maintenance of biodiversity in dynamic landscapes can be explained through the unifying concept of the metacommunity, an ecological system with a changing structure that arises from both the biotic features of its component species and from changing temporal processes. We evaluated the relative importance of environmental factors and spatial factors on the structure of metacommunities of zooplankton in a Neotropical floodplain system, in relation to hydrological dynamics and potential connections among lakes. Zooplankton was sampled from 16 to 22 shallow lakes during droughts and floods in two hydrologically contrasting years. Copepods appeared to be more limited by their dispersal potential, while testate amoebae and rotifers seemed to be controlled mostly by environmental variables. These findings stress the importance of the species sorting metacommunity paradigm for groups with the smallest propagules and adult body sizes. The importance of environmental factors rather than spatial factors was apparent during floods, likely due to the facilitation of animal dispersal by floods. Our results demonstrate that the importance of these factors depends on both the functional traits of major zooplankton groups and the hydrological dynamics of the region.

AB An ongoing research challenge is the detection of biological responses to elevated sediment and the identification of sediment-specific bioassessment metrics to evaluate these biological responses. Laboratory mesocosms and field observations in rivers in Ireland were used to evaluate the relationship between a range of biological and sediment metrics and to assess which biological metrics were best at discerning the effects of excess sediment on macroinvertebrates. Results from the mesocosm study indicated a marked decrease in the abundance of sensitive taxa with increasing sediment surface cover. % EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) and % E abundances exhibited the strongest negative correlation with sediment surface cover in the mesocosm study. The field study revealed that % EPT abundance was most closely correlated with % sediment surface cover, explaining 13% of the variance in the biological metric. Both studies revealed weaker relationships with a number of other taxonomy-based metrics including total taxon abundance, total taxon richness and moderate relationships with the Proportion of Sediment-sensitive Invertebrates metric (PSI). All trait-based metrics were poorly correlated with sediment surface cover in the field study. In terms of sediment metrics, % surface cover was more closely related to biologicalmetrics than either re-suspendable sediment or turbidity. These results indicate that % sediment surface cover and % EPT abundance may be useful metrics for assessing the effect of excessive sediment on macroinvertebrates. However, EPT metrics may not be specific to sediment impact and therefore when applied to rivers with multiple pressures should be combined with observations on sediment cover. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Along the French Mediterranean coast, a complex of eight lagoons underwent intensive eutrophication over four decades, mainly related to nutrient over-enrichment from continuous sewage discharges. The lagoon complex displayed a wide trophic gradient from mesotrophy to hypertrophy and primary production was dominated by phytoplankton communities. In 2005, the implementation of an 11 km offshore outfall system diverted the treated sewage effluents leading to a drastic reduction of anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus into the lagoons. Time series data have been examined from 2000 to 2013 for physical, chemical and biological (phytoplankton) variables of the water column during the summer period. Since 2006, total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations as well as chlorophyll biomass strongly decreased revealing an improvement in lagoon water quality. In summertime, the decline in phytoplankton biomass was accompanied by shifts in community structure and composition that could be explained by adopting a functional approach by considering the common functional traits of the main algal groups. These phytoplankton communities were dominated by functional groups of small-sized and fast-growing algae (diatoms, cryptophytes and green algae). The trajectories of summer phytoplankton communities displayed a complex response to changing nutrient loads over tithe. While diatoms were the major group in 2006 in all the lagoons, the summer phytoplankton composition in hypertrophic lagoons has shifted towards green algae, which are particularly well adapted to summertime conditions. All lagoons showed increasing proportion and occurrence of peridinin-rich dinophytes over time, probably related to their capacity for mixotrophy. The diversity patterns were marked by a strong variability in eutrophic and hypertrophic lagoons whereas phytoplankton community structure reached the highest diversity and stability in mesotrophic lagoons. We observe that during the re-oligotrophication process in coastal lagoons, phytoplankton shows complex trajectories with similarities with those observed in freshwater lake systems.

AB Community-based assessment of protozoa is usually performed at a taxon-dependent resolution. As an inherent 'taxon-free' trait, however, body-size spectrum has proved to be a highly informative indicator to summarize the functional structure of a community in both community research and monitoring programs in aquatic ecosystems. To demonstrate the relationships between the taxon-free resolution of protozoan communities and water conditions, the body-size spectra of biofilm-dwelling protozoa and their seasonal shift and environmental drivers were explored based on an annual dataset collected monthly from coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China. Body sizes were calculated in equivalent spherical diameter (ESD). Among a total of 8 body-size ranks, S2 (19-27 mu m), S3 (28-36 mu m), S4 (37-50 mu m) and S5 (53-71 mu m) were the top four levels in frequency of occurrence, while rank Si (13-17 mu m), S2 and S4 were the dominant levels in abundance. These dominants showed a clear seasonal succession: S2/S4 (spring) -> S2/S4 (summer) -> S4 (autumn) -> S2 (winter) in frequency of occurrence; Si (spring) -> S4 (summer) -> S2 (autumn) -> Si (winter) in abundance. Bootstrapped average analysis showed a clear seasonal shift in body-size spectra of the protozoa during a 1-year cycle, and the best-matching analysis demonstrated that the temporal variations in frequency of occurrence and abundance were significantly correlated with water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), alone or in combination with chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrients. Thus, the body-size spectra of biofilm-dwelling protozoa were seasonally shaped and might be used as a time and cost efficient bioindicator of water quality in marine ecosystems.

AB Trait-based approaches may improve understanding in ecology by linking environmental variation to fitness-related characteristics of species. Most trait-environment studies focus on assemblage-level relationships; yet intraspecific trait variation is important for community, ecosystem, and evolutionary processes, and has substantial implications for these approaches. Assessing population-level trait-environment relationships could test the generality of trait models whilst assessing intraspecific variation. We evaluated the generality of the trilateral life history model (TLHM opportunistic, periodic, and equilibrium endpoints) for fishes - a well-studied trait-environment model at the assemblage level - to populations of three stream fishes in the Midwestern United States in relation to flow regime. The TLHM adequately described major trade-offs in traits amongst populations in all species. Some TLHM flow-based predictions were confirmed, with periodic traits (high fecundity) favoured at sites with greater flow seasonality and lower flow variability in two species, and equilibrium traits (large eggs) in more stable flow conditions in two species. Size at maturity was also inversely related to variability in one species. However, relationships contradicting the TLHM were also found. Coupled with the explanatory power of the TLHM for populations, supporting relationships suggest that synthesizing habitat template models with demographic life history theory could be valuable. Trait-environment models that are well-supported at multiple levels of biological organization could improve understanding of the impacts of environmental change on populations and communities and the valuable ecosystem services that they support.

AB Periphytic diatoms are a key primary producer in floodplain systems. In this study, we assessed the species and functional traits in the periphytic diatom community in three lentic environments directly connected to the Parana River shortly after damming and a decade later. Samples were collected in 2001-2002 and 2010-2011 during high waters phase. Periphytic samples were obtained from Eichhornia azurea Kunth, found in the shore zone of these environments. We recorded a total of 90 diatom species. 47 taxa were exclusive during the period shortly after damming and 18 taxa were only found in 2010-2011. The analysis of the similarity, diversity, beta diversity and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) suggested that there were differences in the species and functional traits of the periphytic diatom community between the two study periods. Variations in water transparency and nutrient (including nitrogen and phosphorus forms) were the most important variables shaping diatom communities diatoms during the study periods. High and motile profiles were characteristic shortly after damming and taxa of high and low profiles predominated a decade later. High transparency, high water and nitrogen levels favored the development of high and low profile, such as Gomphonema augur. var. augur, Synedra goulardii and Amphora sp., whereas taxa belonging to high-profile and motile algae (e.g., Eunotia indica, Nitzschia amphibia) were found in the opposite conditions. Species turnover was an important diversity component that was greatly influenced by limnologic differences over time, represented by environmental and.terrkporal dissimilarities between the years. These changes reinforce the modifications that have occurred in the environmental component of the Upper Parana River floodplain downstream of the dam from the start of its operation.

AB 1. Many recent studies have searched to integrate species' functions and phylogenies in the measurement of biodiversity. To obtain easily interpretable measures, some researchers recommended diversity indices expressed in terms of equivalent numbers of species: the number of equally likely and maximally dissimilar species needed to produce the given value of diversity. Then, biodiversity is often calculated at three scales: within communities (alpha diversity), among communities (beta diversity) and in a region (gamma diversity). These three scales are, however, insufficient to tackle the organization of biodiversity in space because, for most organisms, there is a nested hierarchy of multiple scales characterized by different patterns and processes, from the small neighbourhood to the biosphere.
   2. We developed methodologies for analysing species, functional, taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity in a hierarchy of multiple scales using equivalent numbers of species. As an example, we analysed the taxonomic and functional diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Loire River, France, at four levels: within sites (alpha diversity), among sites within geological regions (beta(1) diversity), among geological regions (beta(2) diversity) and at the river scale (gamma diversity). The new hierarchical approaches of biodiversity revealed very low differences among sites within regions and among regions in terms of taxonomy and functional traits (size and diet), despite moderate, significant species turnover among geological regions.
   3. We compare our framework with those other authors have developed. We argue that different definitions of alpha, beta, gamma diversities are used in the literature reflecting different points of view on biodiversity. We make recommendations on how to normalize functional (or phylogenetic) dissimilarities among species to render sites and regions comparable, and discuss the pros and cons of our approach.
   4. The hierarchical approaches of biodiversity in terms of 'equivalent numbers' respond to current demands to obtain intuitive, easily interpretable components of biodiversity. The approaches we propose go beyond current developments by considering a hierarchy of spatial scales and unbalanced sampling design. They will provide powerful tools to detect the ecological and evolutionary processes that act differently at different scales.

AB QuestionsDoes the increase in disturbance associated with removing harvest residues negatively impact biodiversity and resilience in aspen-dominated forest ecosystems? How do responses of functional diversity measures relate to community recovery and standing biomass?
   LocationAspen (Populus tremuloides, Michx.) mixedwood forests in Minnesota and Michigan, USA.
   MethodsThree levels for two factors, organic matter removal and compaction, were fully crossed, resulting in nine experimental treatments that spanned a range of disturbance severity. Each treatment was replicated three times at each of three sites dominated by the same tree species but having different soil textures (clay, silty loam, sandy). Community composition and taxonomic diversity (species richness, species evenness, Shannon diversity index) were quantified based on woody species abundance sampled 5, 10 and 15yr after disturbance. Community composition response was assessed using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, dispersion and divergence) was also estimated using eight species effect and response traits. Finally, we examined community recovery as well as responses of species and functional diversity to disturbance severity over time using repeated measures ANOVA.
   ResultsTwo responses indicated a potentially negative impact of whole-tree harvest relative to conventional, stem-only harvest: functional richness on silty loam soils and species evenness on clayey soils. Otherwise, negative impacts were restricted to forest floor removal or increased compaction. Recovery in community composition was reduced by the most severe treatments, particularly forest floor removal, across the study, but the responses of functional and taxonomic diversity varied among sites, with some measures increasing as a result of severe disturbance.
   ConclusionsMaximization of standing biomass may mean a short-term sacrifice in species and functional diversity. Also, examinations of forest management impacts on species and functional diversity and composition should apply multiple metrics and indices to ensure potential impacts are not obscured by the reliance on a single approach.

AB AimThe elucidation of patterns and drivers of community assembly remains a fundamental issue in ecology. Past studies have focused on a limited number of communities at local or regional scales, thus precluding a comprehensive examination of assembly rules. We addressed this challenge by examining stream fish community assembly within numerous independent watersheds spanning a broad environmental gradient. We aimed to answer the following questions: (1) are fish communities structured non-randomly, and (2) what is the relative importance of environmental filtering, predator-prey interactions and interspecific competition in driving species associations?
   LocationThe conterminous USA.
   MethodsWe used null models to analyse species associations in streams. Non-random communities were defined as those where the summed number of segregated and aggregated species pairs exceeded the number expected by chance. We used species traits to characterize species dissimilarity in environmental requirements (ENV), identify potential predator-prey interactions (PRED) and estimate likely degree of competition based on species similarity in body size, feeding strategies and phylogeny (COMP). To evaluate the effect of environmental filtering, predation and competition on species associations, we related ENV, PRED and COMP to the degree of species segregation.
   ResultsThe majority (75-85%) of watersheds had non-random fish communities. Species segregation increased with species dissimilarity in environmental requirements (ENV). An increase in competition strength (COMP) did not appear to increase segregation. Species pairs engaging in predator-prey interactions (PRED) were more segregated than non-predator-prey pairs. ENV was more predictive of the degree of species segregation than PRED.
   Main conclusionsWe provide compelling evidence for widespread non-random structure in US stream fish communities. Community assembly is governed largely by environmental filtering, followed by predator-prey interactions, whereas the influence of interspecific competition appears minimal. Applying a traits-based approach to continent-wide datasets provides a powerful approach for examining the existence of assembly rules in nature.

AB Species diversity is often an implicit source of biological insurance for communities against the impacts of novel perturbations, such as the introduction of an invasive species. High environmental heterogeneity (e.g., a mountainous gradient) is expected to beget greater regional species diversity and variation in functional traits related to environmental tolerances. Thus, heterogeneous metacommunities are expected to provide more tolerant colonists that buffer stressed local communities in the absence of dispersal limitation. We tested the hypothesis that importation of a regional zooplankton pool assembled from a diverse array of lakes and ponds lessens the impacts of a novel predator on local species-poor alpine communities by increasing response diversity (i.e., diversity of tolerances to environmental change) as mediated by variation in functional traits related to predator evasion. We also tested whether impacts varied with temperature, as warming may modify (e.g., dampen or amplify) invasion effects. An eight-week factorial experiment ([fishless vs. introduced Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout)]x[ambient temperature vs. heated]x[local vs. local+regional species pool]) was conducted using 32 1,000-L mesocosms. Associations between experimental treatments and species functional traits were tested by R-mode linked to Q-mode (RLQ) and fourth-corner analyses. Although the introduced predator suppressed local species richness and community biomass, colonization by several montane zooplankters reversed these negative effects, resulting in increased species diversity and production. Invasion resistance was unaffected by higher temperatures, which failed to elicit any significance impacts on the community. We discovered that the smaller body sizes of imported species drove functional overcompensation (i.e., increased production) in invaded communities. The observed ecological surprise showed how regionally sourced biodiversity from a highly heterogeneous landscape can offset, and even reverse, the local negative impacts of an invasive species. Further, prey body size was found to be a keyspecies trait mediating the ecological impacts of the aquatic invasive predator. Our study highlights the novel application of a functional approach to understanding the impacts of biological invasions, using species traits that pertain directly to potential responses to exotic species.

AB 1. Hydropower currently accounts for 63% of Canada's total electricity generation and is bound to increase with the energy demands of a growing population. With damming and flow regulation known as major threats to aquatic biodiversity and river and floodplain habitats, an improved understanding of the specific impacts of river regulation is needed for the proper management of these systems.
   2. Although interactions among river flow and thermal regimes have been described in the literature, their concurrent influence on fish guild responses has yet to be analysed for temperate rivers. Such an analysis may be used to identify the ecological traits linked with the flow and thermal variables reflecting river regulation.
   3. Extensive field surveys were conducted across 25 unregulated and regulated rivers to estimate fish species density and biomass. Fish guild models were developed to characterise morphologic, trophic, reproductive, habitat preferences and behavioural traits, as well as phylogenetic associations. To characterise ecologically relevant components of the flow and thermal regimes of rivers, we calculated indices based on the magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and rate of change in each driver. Model relationships between fish biomass and density estimates were then run using redundancy analyses (RDA) on each type of guild and dominant patterns of flow and thermal variability.
   4. Variables representing the magnitude of summer temperatures and intra-annual flow variability were consistently selected as independent drivers of fish guild responses (>86% of RDA models), clearly showing the importance of integrating thermal regimes in current river hydro-ecological studies.
   5. Fish guild density and biomass were significantly explained (R-Adj(2) = 25-44%) and predicted (R-CV(2) = 35-76%) by flow and thermal variables characterising regimes across unregulated and regulated rivers, whereas total fish density and biomass were not. Fish guild models based on traitenvironmental relationships performed better than those based on phylogeny. Our results also showed that the models describing habitat and trophic guilds had the greatest explanatory power (R-Adj(2) = 0.44 and R-Adj(2) = 0.41 respectively).
   6. This study identified differences in guild trait-environment relationships across rivers and the guilds most susceptible to changes in flow and temperature conditions resulting from river regulation. In particular, more constant summer temperatures and lower flow variability favoured habitat and trophic guilds over morphologic, reproductive and behavioural guilds.
   7. Our results showed that maintaining particular aspects of the flow and thermal regime may be important for ensuring the presence of certain guilds in temperate rivers.

AB The disruption of hydrological connectivity by human activities such as flood regulation or land-use changes strongly impacts riparian plant communities. However, landscape-scale processes have generally been neglected in riparian restoration projects as opposed to local conditions, even though such processes might largely influence community recovery. We surveyed plant composition of field edges and riverbanks in 51 riparian zones restored by tree planting (565 1-m(2) plots) within two agricultural watersheds in southeastern Quebec, Canada. Once the effects of environmental variables (hydrology, soil, agriculture, landscape, restoration) were partialled out, three models of spatial autocorrelation based on Moran's eigenvector maps and asymmetric eigenvector maps were compared to quantify the pathways and direction of the spatial processes structuring riparian communities. The ecological mechanisms underlying predominant spatial processes were then assessed by regression trees linking species response to spatial gradients to seed and morphological traits. The structure of riparian communities was predominantly related to unidirectional spatial gradients from upstream to downstream along watercourses, which contributed more to species composition than bidirectional gradients along watercourses or overland. Plant traits selected by regression trees explained 22% of species response to unidirectional upstream-downstream gradients in field edges and 24% in riverbanks, and predominantly corresponded to seed traits rather than morphological traits of the adult plants. Our study showed that even in agriculturally open landscapes, water flow remains a major force structuring spatially riparian plant communities by filtering species according to their seed traits, thereby suggesting long-distance dispersal as a predominant process. Preserving hydrological connectivity at the watershed-scale and restoring riparian plant communities from upstream to downstream should be encouraged to improve the ecological integrity of rivers running through agricultural landscapes.

AB Ecological studies based on time-series often investigate community changes centered on species abundance or biomass but rarely expose the consequential functional aspects underlying such changes. Functional diversity measures have proven to be more accurate predictors for ecosystem functioning than traditional taxonomic approaches and hence gained much attention. There are only limited studies available that analyse the functional implications behind decadal changes of entire communities. We studied zoobenthic communities of two habitats, sheltered and exposed, of a coastal system subject to contrasting changes in community composition over the past four decades. Besides eutrophication and climate-related impacts, the system has been invaded by a non-native polycheate Marenzelleria spp., adding altered functional properties to the communities. The functional dispersion (FDis) metric was used as a measure for comparing the functional diversity of the contrasting habitats, with special focus on the role of Marenzelleria for the entire communities. We highlight changes in the functional identity of the communities, expressed as community-weighted means of trait expression (CWM), using multivariate techniques, and investigate the relationship between taxonomic and functional changes. Despite contrasting community developments in the two habitats, with characteristics traditionally suggesting different environmental quality, we found that the FDis in both habitats remained similar and increased with the introduction of Marenzelleria. Although showing maintained functional diversity across time and space, the functional identity (CWM) of communities changed irrespective of taxonomical differences. Examples include inter alia alterations in palatability proxies, feeding position and sediment transportation types, indicating changed functionality of zoobenthos in coastal systems. We show, when focussing on qualitative functional changes of communities, it is important to evaluate the underlying functional identity, and not only rely on measures of the diversity of functions per se, as the quality indication of expressed functional traits can be concealed when using multi-functionality approaches.

AB Changes in land use practices have affected the integrity and the quality of stream water worldwide. Effective catchment management, in terms of land use alteration, depends on our ability to quantify ecologically significant changes and to discriminate among varying levels of impact. In this study, we assessed the structural and functional changes upstream and downstream of eight small water reservoirs in western Slovakia and the relationship between these changes and shifts in physicochemical parameters as a consequence of stream damming and catchment land use. Dams were categorized into two groups, the first with both inlet and outlet situated in deforested and agricultural landscape and the second with inlet flowing through natural and forested landscape, while outlet is situated in deforested and urban region. Using a "between-groups" principal components analysis and a "between-groups" fuzzy principal components analysis, we found significant differences in structural and functional composition of macroinvertebrate communities between inlets with forested catchment and outlets flowing through agricultural, urban landscape. The structural dissimilarity is best explained by the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the aquatic environment, while functional variation of communities is best explained by land use of an area surrounding the stream. The distance in structural and functional community composition between inlet and outlet was linked with difference in environmental conditions between these habitats. The change of structural community composition significantly reflected shift in the water temperature and phosphorus concentration, while the change of functional community composition was determined by change of nutrient concentrations (e.g., PO4, NO3, NH4) and pH.

AB Exposure to trace metals typically causes oxidative stress; these consequences are better-characterized in estuarine and marine species than in freshwater species. How cellular-level responses to metal pollution influence whole-organism and population-level traits is poorly understood. We tested whether exposure to single metals (zinc and cadmium) and to metal mixtures (water in equilibrium with sediment from a highly polluted lake) alters two ecologically-relevant traits in freshwater clams, locomotion and reproduction. Fingernail clams (Musculium spp.) from unimpacted habitats were exposed to single metals and the metal mixture for up to 49 days. The single metal doses (<= 5 mg/L Zn and <= 20 mu g/L Cd) were not toxicologically meaningful as clam survival, burial, and climbing activity did not differ across treatments. Water in equilibrium with the lake sediment contained cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc. Clams exposed to this metal mixture had decreased climbing activity but no change in burial activity. Metal-exposed clams had lower fecundity (number of shelled juveniles extruded by adult clams) and patterns in metal accumulation corresponded with lake sediment dose and clam activity. In contrast to the functional traits, stress protein expression and whole-clam glycogen content did not vary across treatment groups. These results indicate that fingernail clams of the genus Musculium are appropriate for development as sentinel species for metal pollution and can serve as a model for determining how metal pollution alters metabolic allocation patterns in freshwater organisms.

AB Waxy compounds form the boundary layer of the living leaf and contribute biomarkers to soils, and lake and marine sediments. Cataloging the variation in leaf wax traits between species and across environmental gradients may contribute to the understanding of plant functional processes in modern ecosystems, as well as to calibration efforts supporting reconstruction of past ecosystems and environments from the sedimentary archives of leaf wax biomarkers. Towards these goals, we have surveyed the distributions of leaf wax n-alkanes in trees from the lowland tropical rainforest (TR) and montane cloud forest (TMCF) of Peru. Molecular abundances were quantified via gas chromatography flame ionization detection (GC-FID) for 632 individuals, 152 species, 99 genera and 51 families across 9 forest plots spanning 0.2-3.6 km elevation. We found the expected abundance distributions; for example, they were dominated by long chain, odd numbered n-alkanes, especially C-29 and C-31. New observations included a tendency to increasing total alkane concentration at higher elevation. We propose that the well known leaf economic strategy to increase leaf mass per unit area with elevation, provides a theoretical basis for understanding the increase in leaf wax n-alkane abundance with elevation: we infer an increased investment in foliar defense associated with increased leaf lifespan and in response to environmental pressures including cloud immersion and declining temperature. Furthermore, we combined measurements of n-alkane concentration with estimates of forest productivity to provide new ways to quantify ecosystem-scale forest alkane productivity. We introduce a new concept of n-alkane net primary productivity (NPPalk; the product of alkane concentration and leaf NPP) and find that alkane productivity estimates range from 300 to 5000 g C/ha/yr, associated with ecological and environmental changes across the elevation profile.

AB Many methods in freshwater biomonitoring tend to be restricted to a few levels of biological organization, limiting the potential spectrum of measurable of cause-effect responses to different anthropogenic impacts. We combined distinct organisational levels, covering biological biomarkers (histopathological and biochemical reactions in liver and fish gills), community based bioindicators (fish guilds, invertebrate metrics/traits and chironomid pupal exuviae) and ecosystem functional indicators (decomposition rates) to assess ecological status at designated Water Framework Directive monitoring sites, covering a gradient of human impact across several rivers in northern Portugal. We used Random Forest to rank the variables that contributed more significantly to successfully predict the different classes of ecological status and also to provide specific cut levels to discriminate each WFD class based on reference condition. A total of 59 Biological Quality Elements and functional indicators were determined using this procedure and subsequently applied to develop the integrated Multiple Ecological Level Index (MELI Index), a potentially powerful bioassessment tool.

AB There is an urgent need to track how natural systems are responding to global change in order to better guide management efforts. Traditionally, taxonomically based metrics have been used as indicators of ecosystem integrity and conservation status. However, functional approaches offer promising advantages that can improve bioassessment performance. In this study, we aim to test the applicability of functional redundancy (FR), a functional feature related to the stability, resistance and resilience of ecosystems, as a tool for bioassessment, looking at woody riparian communities in particular. We used linear mixed-effect models to investigate the response of FR and other traditional biomonitoring indices to natural (drought duration) and anthropogenic stress gradients (flow regulation and agriculture) in a Mediterranean basin. Such indices include species richness, a taxonomic index, and the Riparian Quality Index, which is an index of ecological status. Then, we explored the ability of FR and the other indices to discriminate between different intensities of human alteration. FR showed higher explanatory capacity in response to multiple stressors, although we found significant negative relationships between all the biological indices (taxonomic, functional and ecological quality) and stress gradients. In addition, FR was the most accurate index to discriminate among different categories of human alteration in both perennial and intermittent river reaches, which allowed us to set threshold values to identify undisturbed (reference condition), moderately disturbed and highly disturbed reaches in the two types of river. Using these thresholds and the best-fitting model, we generated a map of human impact on the functional redundancy of riparian communities for all the stretches of the river network. Our results demonstrate that FR presents clear advantages over traditional methods, which suggests that it should be part of the biomonitoring toolbox used for environmental management so as to obtain better predictions of ecosystem response to environmental changes.

AB Diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton is a widespread phenomenon in both oceans and lakes, and is generally considered to be the largest synchronized movement of biomass on Earth. Most existing mathematical models of DVM are based on the assumption that animals maximize a certain criterion such as the expected reproductive value, the venturous revenue, the ratio of energy gain/mortality or some predator avoidance function when choosing their instantaneous depth. The major shortcoming of this general point of view is that the predicted DVM may be strongly affected by a subjective choice of a particular optimization criterion. Here we argue that the optimal strategy of DVM can be unambiguously obtained as an outcome of selection in the underlying equations of genotype/traits frequency dynamics. Using this general paradigm, we explore the optimal strategy for the migration across different depths by zooplankton grazers throughout the day. To illustrate our ideas we consider four generic DVM models, each making different assumptions on the population dynamics of zooplankton, and demonstrate that in each model we need to maximize a particular functional to find the optimal strategy. Surprisingly, patterns of DVM obtained for different models greatly differ in terms of their parameters dependence. We then show that the infinite dimensional trait space of different zooplankton trajectories can be projected onto a low dimensional space of generalized parameters and the genotype evolution dynamics can be easily followed using this low-dimensional space. Using this space of generalized parameters we explore the influence of mutagenesis on evolution of DVM, and we show that strong mutagenesis allows the coexistence of an infinitely large number of strategies whereas for weak mutagenesis the selection results in the extinction of most strategies, with the surviving strategies all staying close to the optimal strategy in the corresponding mutagenesis-free system.

AB Global warming alters species composition and function of freshwater ecosystems. However, the impact of temperature on primary productivity is not sufficiently understood and water quality models need to be improved in order to assess the quantitative and qualitative changes of aquatic communities. On the basis of experimental data, we demonstrate that the commonly used photosynthetic and water chemistry parameters alone are not sufficient for modeling phytoplankton growth under changing temperature regimes. We present some new aspects of the acclimation process with respect to temperature and how contrasting responses may be explained by a more complete physiological knowledge of the energy flow from photons to new biomass. We further suggest including additional bio-markers/traits for algal growth such as carbon allocation patterns to increase the explanatory power of such models. Although carbon allocation patterns are promising and functional cellular traits for growth prediction under different nutrient and light conditions, their predictive power still waits to be tested with respect to temperature. A great challenge for the near future will be the prediction of primary production efficiencies under the global change scenario using a uniform model for phytoplankton assemblages.

AB Biodiversity is well studied in ecology and the concept has been developed to include traits of species, rather than solely taxonomy, to better reflect the functional diversity of a system. The deep sea provides a natural environmental gradient within which to study changes in different diversity metrics, but traits of deep-sea fish are not widely known, hampering the application of functional diversity to this globally important system. We used morphological traits to determine the functional richness and functional divergence of demersal fish assemblages along the continental slope in the Northeast Atlantic, at depths of 300-2,000 m. We compared these metrics to size diversity based on individual body size and species richness. Functional richness and size diversity showed similar patterns, with the highest diversity at intermediate depths; functional divergence showed the opposite pattern, with the highest values at the shallowest and deepest parts of the study site. Species richness increased with depth. The functional implications of these patterns were deduced by examining depth-related changes in morphological traits and the dominance of feeding guilds as illustrated by stable isotope analyses. The patterns in diversity and the variation in certain morphological traits can potentially be explained by changes in the relative dominance of pelagic and benthic feeding guilds. All measures of diversity examined here suggest that the deep areas of the continental slope may be equally or more diverse than assemblages just beyond the continental shelf.

AB The positive effects of water quality improvement on stream biodiversity in the temperate regions are expected to be at risk with the projected climatic changes. However, the processes and mechanisms behind the predicted threats remain uncertain. From long-term series of benthic invertebrate samples from temperate rivers and streams in France, we analyzed diversity and composition shifts over time in relation to geographic elements and human stressors. Mechanisms for community changes were investigated with a trait-based analysis for the entire dataset and for a selected caddisfly community module. We observed a 42% increase in the taxonomic richness of stream invertebrate communities over the last 25 years. A gradual trend induced by water quality improvement was distinguished from a more abrupt climate change-induced shift in communities around the year 2000. Trophic amplification - the intensification of trophic interactions and pathways through the food web was identified as the mechanism behind the strong community shift. Four lines of evidence for this trophic amplification are highlighted: (i) higher dissolved oxygen concentrations indicated a shift in primary production, (ii) the trait-based analysis of entire communities showed a bottom-up food web amplification, (iii) the trait-based analysis of the community module evidenced feeding strategy shifts and increased food web interactions, and (iv) the abundance analysis of the community module showed a productivity increase. These results lend credit to persistent investments in water quality for improving stream biodiversity, and contrary to expectation, climate change impacts seem so far to have reinforced these positive effects.

To analyse plant communities in terms of their trait composition, community-weighted means were calculated using eight functional traits. Forests were characterized by local (physical.features, hydrological regime and historical disturbances) and landscape (surrounding land use) variables. Spatial processes stnicturing comm unities were assessed using Moran's eigenvector maps and asymmetric eigenvector maps. The relative importance of these three subsets (local, landscape and spatial variables) on tree, shrub and herb functional composition was quantified by variation partitioning using redundancy analyses.
   Results: Functional patterns in riparian forests resulted primarily :front environmental filtering (local and landscape variables). Local conditions, especially flood intensity, exerted an overriding selection pressure on functional composition of riparian plant communities. Urbanization seemed to act indirectly on trait patterns through the alteration of hydrological disturbances caused by ongoing and historical land transformation. Nevertheless, dispersal along rivers was also a significant structuring force, while overland dispersal was negligible.
   Conclusions: Our study highlights that under severe natural disturbance regimes, the effect of natural filters outweighed the negative effects of urban filters. However, the alteration of natural flooding processes by human activities is also a major mechanism influencing plant trait composition in urban riparian communities as forests subjected to reduced flooding intensity experienced a greater effect of urbanization, The effects of urbanization and of past land uses on plant communities were greater for trees than for shrubs and herbs due to the high turnover rate of the latter. Finally, our results showed the importance of dispersal along rivers for biodiversity even in fragmented urban landscapes.

AB Emerging infectious disease outbreaks are increasingly suspected to be a consequence of human pressures exerted on natural ecosystems. Previously, host taxonomic communities have been used as indicators of infectious disease emergence, and the loss of their diversity has been implicated as a driver of increased presence. The mechanistic details in how such pathogen-host systems function, however, may not always be explained by taxonomic variation or loss. Here we used machine learning and methods based on Gower's dissimilarity to quantify metrics of invertebrate functional diversity, in addition to functional groups and their taxonomic diversity at sites endemic and non-endemic for the model generalist pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent of Buruli ulcer. Changes in these metrics allowed the rapid categorisation of the ecological niche of the mycobacterium's hosts and the ability to relate specific host traits to its presence in aquatic ecosystems. We found that taxonomic diversity of hosts and overall functional diversity loss and evenness had no bearing on the mycobacterium's presence, or whether the site was in an endemic area. These findings, however, provide strong evidence that generalist environmentally persistent bacteria such as M. ulcerans can be associated with specific functional traits rather than taxonomic groups of organisms, increasing our understanding of emerging disease ecology and origin.

AB AimDifferences in dispersal limitation and environmental filtering have been proposed to explain differences in diversity patterns between regions. Incorporating functional traits into studies of assembly rules allows the relative strengths of such processes to be distinguished. We test the predictions that assemblages in a similar environment under strong dispersal limitation should be differentiated taxonomically but not functionally, whereas strong environmental filtering should more differentiate assemblages functionally.
   LocationFrench Guiana and France.
   MethodsWe used two datasets on fish assemblage composition: one for French Guiana and one for continental France. We constrained both dataset to have similar geographical extent and similar environment using site location and topographic variables of the French Guiana dataset to select continental France data. We estimated functional diversity using a combination of 15 fish morphological traits. We computed species and functional richness at regional and local scales for both regions. We calculated taxonomic and functional turnover between sites and compared them within and between regions.
   ResultsTaxonomic and functional richness were higher in tropical fish assemblages than in temperate ones both on regional and local scales. Species richness differences between the two regions resulted in very similar functional richness. Temperate assemblages showed a higher functional turnover than tropical assemblages, but a lower taxonomic turnover. We found a stronger turnover in taxonomic diversity than in functional diversity between tropical assemblages, and the opposite pattern between temperate ones.
   Main conclusionsThe higher functional richness in tropical assemblages was mainly caused by an increased number of species compared to temperate assemblages, probably linked with an increase in available niches. Dispersal limitation was the predominant process in structuring Guianese stream fish assemblages causing strong species replacement, whereas French stream fish assemblages were mainly under strong environmental filtering resulting in local adaptations to different environments.

AB Studies into the function of structures are crucial for making connections between morphology and behaviour of organisms, but are still rare for the terrestrial Testudinidae. We investigated the kinematics of shoulder girdle and forelimb motion in Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni using biplanar X-ray fluoroscopy with a twofold aim: firstly, to understand how the derived shapes of shoulder girdle and carapace together influence rotation of the girdle; and, secondly, to understand how girdle rotation affects forelimb excursion. The total degree of shoulder rotation in the horizontal plane is similar to a species with a less domed shell, but because of the long and nearly vertically oriented scapular prong, shoulder girdle rotation contributes more than 30% to the horizontal arc of the humerus and nearly 40% to the rotational component of step length. The antebrachium and manus, which act as a functional unit, contribute roughly 50% to this component of the step length because of their large excursion almost parallel to the mid-sagittal plane. This large excursion is the result of the complex interplay between humerus long-axis rotation, counter-rotation of the antebrachium, and elbow flexion and extension. A significant proportion of forelimb step length results from body translation that is due to the propulsive effect of the other limbs during their stance phases. Traits that are similar to other tortoises and terrestrial or semi-aquatic turtles are the overall slow walk because of a low stride frequency, and the lateral-sequence, diagonally coupled footfall pattern with high duty factors. Intraspecific variation of carapace shape and shoulder girdle dimensions has a corresponding effect on forelimb kinematics.

AB Spatial variability of environmental factors and macrobenthos, using species and functional groups, was examined over the same scales (100s of cm to >100 km) in intertidal sediments of two transitional water systems. The objectives were to test if functional groups were a good species surrogate and explore the relationship between environmental variables and macrobenthos. Environmental variables, diversity and the multivariate assemblage structure showed the highest variability at the scale of 10s of km. However, abundance was more variable at 10s of m. Consistent patterns were achieved using species and functional groups therefore, these may be a good species surrogate. Total carbon, salinity and silt/clay were the strongest correlated with macrobenthic assemblages. Results are valuable for design and interpretation of future monitoring programs including detection of anthropogenic disturbances in transitional systems and propose improvements in environmental variable sampling to refine the assessment of their relationship with biological data across spatial scales.

AB The highly programmed fragmentation of chromosomes and elimination of large amounts of nuclear DNA from the presomatic cell lineages (i.e., chromatin diminution), occurs in the embryos of the freshwater zooplankton Mesocyclops edax (S.A. Forbes, 1891) (Crustacea: Copepoda). The somatic genome is reorganized and reduced to a size five times smaller even though the germline genome remains intact. We present the first comprehensive, quantitative model of DNA content throughout embryogenesis in a copepod that possesses embryonic DNA elimination. We used densitometric image analysis to measure the DNA content of polar bodies, germline and somatic nuclei, and excised DNA "droplets." We report: 1) variable DNA contents of polar bodies, some of which do not contain the amount corresponding to the haploid germline genome size; 2) presence of pronuclei in newly laid embryo sacs; 3) gonomeric chromosomes in the second to fourth cleavage divisions and in the primordial germ cell and primordial endoderm cell during the fifth cleavage division; 4) timing of early embryonic cell stages, elimination of DNA, and divisions of the primordial germ cell and primordial endoderm cell at 22 degrees C; and 5) persistence of a portion of the excised DNA "droplets" throughout embryogenesis. DNA elimination is a trait that spans multiple embryonic stages and a knowledge of the timing and variability of the associated cytological events with DNA elimination will promote the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in this trait. We propose the "genome yolk hypothesis" as a functional explanation for the persistence of the eliminated DNA that might serve as a resource during postdiminution cleavage divisions.

AB Landscape and local environmental factors are responsible for different structuring processes in aquatic communities. In this study, we evaluated the relative influence of local and landscape variables on the taxonomic and functional composition of phytoplankton. Samples were obtained from 29 floodplain lakes located in the Tocantins-Araguaia River Basin in Brazil. Taxonomic composition was assessed using densities of species, and functional composition was assessed using three classes of functional traits: morphological, physiological and behavioral. We used a partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) to evaluate the effect of local and landscape variables on taxonomic and functional phytoplankton composition. We found higher predictive power for environmental variables at the local scale for functional composition (physiological and behavioral traits) compared with their power for taxonomic composition. However, the type of land cover did not affect either taxonomic or functional composition. Phosphorus concentration and oxygen saturation were the main factors related to physiological traits, while zooplankton density and oxygen saturation to behavioral traits. These results indicate that local environmental variables act as determinants of the taxonomic and functional composition of phytoplankton in these lakes and that functional traits may be more appropriate than taxonomic composition for evaluating relationships between these communities and environmental factors.

AB Seed mass is an important plant functional trait linked to germination. For instance, higher-mass seeds often display greater germination compared to lower-mass seeds when exposed to non-stressful conditions. Yet, knowledge pertaining to germination dynamics for different mass-based seed fractions following exposure to abiotic stress is lacking. Here, we assess the germination response of relatively fresh, mass-separated Rudbeckia mollis (Asteraceae) seeds to various simulated seasonal temperatures, supra-optimal temperatures and increasing ageing stress duration. Air density separation yielded three mass-based classes, called light (393 +/- 35 g), intermediate (423 +/- 29 g) and heavy (474 +/- 38 g). Water uptake kinetics indicated that imbibition (0-6 h) and germination lag (6-24 h) were independent of seed mass. Similarly, germination and viability loss of fresh seeds following exposure to seasonal and supra-optimal constant temperatures were independent of mass. However, seed mass influenced germination following increasing ageing stress, with light seeds germinating to a significantly greater extent than intermediate or heavy seeds. For example, final germination per cent in light-class seeds was about 1.7 times greater than intermediate or heavy seeds after 20 d of saturated salt accelerated ageing (SSAA). Seeds stored for 1 year in the laboratory displayed mass-dependent germination patterns similar to seeds following SSAA. Mass-independent germination responses may be a strategy to maintain an annual life history in otherwise difficult environments when R. mollis seeds are relatively fresh. However, differences in germination response between aged and unaged seeds suggest that mass-dependent viability loss may occur in R. mollis.

AB Species trait data have been used to predict and infer ecological processes and the responses of biological communities to environmental changes. It has also been suggested that, in lieu of trait, data niche differences can be inferred from phylogenetic distance. It remains unclear how variation in trait data may influence the strength and character of ecological inference. Using species-level trait data in community ecology assumes intraspecific variation is small in comparison with interspecific variation. Intraspecific variation across species ranges or within populations may lead to variability in trait data derived from different scales (i.e., local or regional) and methods (i.e., mean or maximum values). Variation in trait data across species can affect community-level relationships. I examined variability in body size, a key trait often measured across taxa. I collected 12 metrics of fish species length (including common and maximum values) for 40 species from literature, online databases, museum collections, and field data. I then tested whether different metrics of fish length could consistently predict observed species range boundary shifts and the impacts of an introduced predator on inland lake fish communities across Ontario, Canada. I also investigated whether phylogenetic signal, an indicator of niche-conservativism, changed among measures. I found strong correlations between length metrics and limited variation across metrics. Accordingly, length was a consistently significant predictor of the response of fish communities to environmental change. Additionally, I found significant evidence of phylogenetic signal in fish length across metrics. Limited variation in length across metrics (within species), in comparison with variation within metrics (across species), made fish species length a reliable predictor at a community-level. When considering species-level trait data from different sources, researchers should examine the potential influence of intraspecific trait variation on data derived by different metrics and at different scales.

AB Environmental change can alter both species distribution range patterns at a regional scale and their feeding habits at a local scale. While several studies have highlighted the mechanisms driving such changes separately, little is known on their combined effect on the local communities. In this manuscript, we used both feeding and distributional traits of macro-benthic species and examined their combined response across an environmental gradient induced by an aquaculture unit. Our results mainly suggest that specialized predators with narrow geographic distributions and niches were more sensitive to environmental change than the less specialized groups. Moreover, under harsh environmental conditions, predatory species with a wide dispersion capacity can sustain viable populations through niche generalization. In contrast, in areas of low environmental disturbance, predatory species with a more restricted dispersal capability (i.e. some endemic species) can coexist via niche differentiation. In this context, our findings contribute towards a better understanding of benthic communities' functional response to environmental change and may be of use in environmental impact assessment.

AB Anticipated climatic changes combined with eutrophication are predicted to enhance the dominance of several notorious cyanobacterial taxa. Cyanobacteria have many key ecological traits that may allow them to thrive under foreseen scenarios of environmental change. Understanding the ecophysiological traits of harmful species has proven important for their successful control and management. Indeed, if the links between key cyanobacterial traits and the specific environmental conditions that allow expression of these traits can be disrupted, we could identify (novel) means for operational control and mitigate or prevent water quality problems. A good example is artificial mixing of a lake that breaks down the water column stability on which fast floating, buoyant cyanobacteria depend. Based upon Reynolds' functional phytoplankton classification, we focused on five groups of cyanobacteria that from a management point of view can be seen as homogeneous and have comparable environmental sensitivities. For each group, we present (1) its key traits, (2) how these characteristics will maintain their function under future environmental change, (3) explanation of how understanding the function of these traits can reveal the "Achilles heel" of the particular functional group and (4) which (combination of) control measures is most likely to be successful. Despite looking for specific environmental sensitivities of individual groups, we maintain that controlling nutrients remains the basis for managing blooms, no matter which functional type dominates. Providing further ecological knowledge to lake management could be the key to effective bloom control and healthier, sustainable freshwater ecosystems even in a warmer future.

AB Increasing hydropower expansion in hyper-diverse tropical river basins is currently threatening aquatic biodiversity on an unprecedented scale. Among the largest and most controversial of these projects is the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Complex being constructed on the Xingu River, a major Amazon tributary in Brazil. Despite the potentially large impacts, almost no baseline ecological data are available for the river's diverse ichthyofauna. This study uses ecomorphology and stable isotope analysis to explore the functional and trophic relationships among four of the dominant families within the Xingu River rapids (Loricariidae, Cichlidae, Anostomidae, and Serrasalmidae). Morphological analysis revealed clear separation of these families based on functional traits associated with microhabitat use and foraging strategies, with the Loricariidae and Cichlidae displaying greatest functional diversity. The four families analyzed were not clearly differentiated in isotopic space defined by delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Considerable overlap was observed among isotopic niches and all four families primarily assimilated material originating from phytomicrobenthos (assumed to be mainly benthic algae). Differences between morphological and trophic diversity within families provide insight into how this diverse assemblage may be partitioning niche space, which in turn has implications for population responses to hydrologic alteration.

AB Riparian vegetation directly or indirectly affects many important structural and functional processes in stream ecosystems. We used a contiguous paired-reach approach in 4 km of open and shaded reaches in 8 boreal streams to study the effects of canopy cover on in-stream physicochemical (temperature, nutrients), substratum, and biotic assemblages (benthic diatom, macrophyte, invertebrate). Canopy cover, woody debris, and summer temperatures differed between paired reaches. Variation partitioning (partial redundancy analysis) showed that benthic diatom traits, but not species composition, were related strongly to canopy cover (33% of the variance was explained by canopy cover alone). In contrast, using variation partitioning, we found no support for the hypothesis that canopy cover was a strong predictor of macrophyte or benthic invertebrate assemblages. However, multivariable regression (redundancy analysis) showed that canopy cover was a significant predictor of invertebrate taxonomic and trait composition (explaining similar to 26% of the variability), after accounting for covariance with other environmental variables. In agreement with predictions, univariate analyses revealed that macrophyte traits related to light and growth forms were correlated negatively with canopy cover. Our findings that canopy cover resulted in lower summer temperatures, higher amounts of woody debris, and differences in community structure and traits support the importance of riparian buffer strips as a management tool for maintaining biodiversity and for managing stream ecosystems for the warmer future.

AB Ecological research based on both species and their traits helps us understand the mechanisms structuring ecological communities. Our aim was to dismantle the effects of environmental variables measured at multiple spatial scales on the taxonomic and functional trait composition of benthic macroinvertebrate communities and to clarify the relationship between the environment and communities in high-latitude streams. Traits were combined into unique trait combinations (site-by-traits matrix), called hereafter the overall trait composition of macroinvertebrate communities, and then the matrix was decomposed into progressively smaller parts of individual traits (site-by-individual trait matrix). The effects of variables from different spatial scales on the variation in the overall trait matrix, decomposed trait matrices, and taxonomic data were analyzed using redundancy analysis and partial linear regression modeling. Our analyses indicated that: 1) the taxonomic composition of communities was more closely associated with factors measured at larger spatial scales, and the trait composition of communities was more closely associated with factors measured at smaller spatial scales, even within 1 drainage basin; 2) decomposing overall trait composition to its individual components of single traits revealed important patterns related to the potential causal factors; and 3) the abundances of organisms exhibiting different traits may be linked strongly to different environmental variables operating at different spatial scales. Our findings highlight the benefits of describing both the taxonomic and trait composition of communities when exploring the drivers of community composition. They also have direct applications in monitoring the vulnerability of high-latitude streams to future environmental changes.

AB Mammal species have made the transition to the marine environment several times, and their lineages represent one of the classical examples of convergent evolution in morphological and physiological traits. Nevertheless, the genetic mechanisms of their phenotypic transition are poorly understood, and investigations into convergence at the molecular level have been inconclusive. While past studies have searched for convergent changes at specific amino acid sites, we propose an alternative strategy to identify those genes that experienced convergent changes in their selective pressures, visible as changes in evolutionary rate specifically in the marine lineages. We present evidence of widespread convergence at the gene level by identifying parallel shifts in evolutionary rate during three independent episodes of mammalian adaptation to the marine environment. Hundreds of genes accelerated their evolutionary rates in all three marine mammal lineages during their transition to aquatic life. These marine-accelerated genes are highly enriched for pathways that control recognized functional adaptations in marine mammals, including muscle physiology, lipid-metabolism, sensory systems, and skin and connective tissue. The accelerations resulted from both adaptive evolution as seen in skin and lung genes, and loss of function as in gustatory and olfactory genes. In regard to sensory systems, this finding provides further evidence that reduced senses of taste and smell are ubiquitous in marine mammals. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of identifying genes underlying convergent organism-level characteristics on a genomewide scale and without prior knowledge of adaptations, and provides a powerful approach for investigating the physiological functions of mammalian genes.

AB Lakes are considered as "islands" for assessing microbial biogeography, but bacterial community composition (BCC) and function may vary significantly within lakes, with the roles of scale and connectivity still unclear. This study investigated the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the BCC (automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) and functional traits (FT, carbon-source utilization), and the contribution of: (i) environmental variables, (ii) phytoplankton, (iii) season, and (iv) space, through variance partitioning in the large and well-mixed Lake Mangueira. The BCC and FT differed in time and space, with BCC being explained by environmental variables and phytoplankton, whereas FT was explained only by space. The smallest scale of variability detected by the BCC and FT (similar to 49 km) was larger than scales found in the other studies, suggesting an effect of lake size (fetch and connectivity). Our results indicate that barriers to bacterial dispersal due to long distances are overcome by high connectivity, reinforcing the role of species sorting for BCC. FT were probably driven by gene dispersal and/or the effects of local conditions on migrant bacterial taxa and resuspended bacteria. Our results highlight the role of within-lake heterogeneity for ecosystem functioning and the implications for the appropriate scale to use in sampling bacterial communities.

AB Turfs are widespread assemblages (consisting of microbes and algae) that inhabit reef systems. They are the most abundant benthic component in the Abrolhos reef system (Brazil), representing greater than half the coverage of the entire benthic community. Their presence is associated with a reduction in three-dimensional coral reef complexity and decreases the habitats available for reef biodiversity. Despite their importance, the taxonomic and functional diversity of turfs remain unclear. We performed a metagenomics and pigments profile characterization of turfs from the Abrolhos reefs. Turf microbiome primarily encompassed Proteobacteria (mean 40.57% +/- s.d. 10.36, N = 1.548,192), Cyanobacteria (mean 35.04% +/- s.d. 15.5, N = 1.337,196), and Bacteroidetes (mean 11.12% +/- s.d. 4.25, N = 424,185). Oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophs, chemolithotrophs, and aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AANP) bacteria showed a conserved functional trait of the turf microbiomes. Genes associated with oxygenic photosynthesis, AANP, sulfur cycle (S oxidation, and DMSP consumption), and nitrogen metabolism (N-2 fixation, ammonia assimilation, dissimilatory nitrate and nitrite ammonification) were found in the turf microbiomes. Principal component analyses of the most abundant taxa and functions showed that turf microbiomes differ from the other major Abrolhos benthic microbiomes (i.e., corals and rhodoliths) and seawater. Taken together, these features suggest that turfs have a homogeneous functional core across the Abrolhos Bank, which holds diverse microbial guilds when comparing with other benthic organisms.

AB Adaptive radiations have been hypothesized to contribute broadly to the diversity of organisms. Models of adaptive radiation predict that ecological opportunity and ecological release, the availability of empty ecological niches and the response by adapting lineages to occupy them, respectively, drive patterns of phenotypic and lineage diversification. Adaptive radiations driven by 'ecological opportunity' are well established in island systems; it is less clear if ecological opportunity influences continent-wide diversification. We use Neotropical cichlid fishes to test if variation in rates of functional evolution is consistent with changing ecological opportunity. Across a functional morphological axis associated with ram suction feeding traits, evolutionary rates declined through time as lineages diversified in South America. Evolutionary rates of ram suction functional morphology also appear to have accelerated as cichlids colonized Central America and encountered renewed opportunity. Our results suggest that ecological opportunity may play an important role in shaping patterns of morphological diversity of even broadly distributed lineages like Neotropical cichlids.

AB Global production of pharmacologically active compounds exceeds 100 000 tons annually, a proportion of which enters aquatic environments through patient use, improper medicine disposal, and production. These compounds are designed to have mode-of-action (MoA) effects, on specific biological pathways, with potential to impact nontarget species. Here, we used MoA and trait-based approaches to quantify uptake and biological effects of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in filter and deposit feeding marine worms (Hediste diversicolor). Worms exposed to 10 mu g L-1, accumulated fluoxetine with a body burden over 270 times greater than exposure concentrations, resulting in similar to 10% increased coelomic fluid serotonin, a pharmacological effect. Observed effects included weight loss (up to 2% at 500 mu g L-1), decreased feeding rate (68% at 500 pig L-1), and altered metabolism (oxygen consumption, ammonia excretion, and O/N from 10 mu g L-1). Bioconcentration of fluoxetine was dependent on route of uptake, with filter feeding worms experiencing up to 130 times greater body burden ratios and increased magnitudes of effects than deposit feeders, a trait-based sensitivity likely as a consequence of fluoxetine partitioning to sediment. This study highlights how novel approaches such as MoA and trait-based methods can supplement environmental risk assessments of pharmaceuticals.

AB Assembly rules are ecological processes imposed on a regional species bank to establish the structure of communities and define diversity patterns regarding space and time. Here, we investigated the trait distribution of periphytic algae in floodplain lakes that are naturally under contrasting environmental pressures with and without flood pulse action (low and high water phases) and the relationship between functional traits and environmental variables at regional and local scales. We hypothesized that functional clustering will be related to the low water phase in local scale, based on environment filters, and functional overdispersion to the high water phase in regional scale. With respect to traits, we can expect that the flood pulse would favored the prevalence of nanoperiphyton, filamentous forms and loosely attached. For this, we conducted a two-year assessment of the structure and dynamic of periphytic algae communities regarding their functional traits in lakes belonging to two sub-basins in a subtropical flood plain (upper Parana River floodplain). The samplings occurred during the high water phase in 2010 and 2011 and the low water phase in 2011. The functional diversity values of the communities were quantified and compared with the mean value of communities randomly generated using null models. The relationships between functional traits and environmental variables were examined using RLQ analysis. We have shown that the traits respond to abiotic factors, and they indicated overdispersion in high water phase, and higher functional diversity in most preserved environments with absence of the pulse. The flood pulse favored the prevalence of colonial life form, stalked, entangled and heterotrichous species. This study showed spatial and temporal differences in the limnological characteristics between the lakes caused by hydrological phase and local forces in different sub-basins and the importance mainly of assimilable nutrients in the evaluation of trait-environment relationships. The overdispersion result can be assigned to flood pulse, which promotes a higher probability of dispersion and colonization of new areas for rare species, disturbance and more heterogeneous habitats, allowing opportunities for resource partitioning and regeneration of different species strategies. Moreover, the higher periphytic algae functional diversity in preserved sites emphasizes the importance of understanding ecological patterns linked to environmental degradation, as well as of conservation initiatives, because variation in periphytic algal communities implies in changes in the trophic structure, dynamics and in the functioning of environments.

AB Aim To examine species and trait composition in stream diatoms along environmental, climatic and spatial gradients and to ascertain if the use of different levels of biological organization is beneficial for investigating global environmental changes and the role of history in structuring communities.
   Location Global cover with datasets from the Antilles, France, Finland, New Zealand, La Reunion and the United States.
   Methods We related diatom species composition, guild composition, total richness and richness across guilds to environmental, climatic and spatial variables. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) with environmental variable fitting, redundancy analysis (RDA) with variation partitioning, analysis of similarities and linear mixed models as statistical tools.
   Results Species composition differed significantly among the study regions, while the differences in guild composition were less pronounced. US and French streams shared a large number of species, whereas islands shared only a few species with continents. For species composition, all predictors showed significant relationships with diatoms but pH, longitude, annual temperature and precipitation had the strongest impact. Variation partitioning revealed that the local environment outperformed climatic and spatial variables. For guild composition, there was a substantial overlap across regions in NMDS. The results from RDA demonstrated, however, that guild composition was better explained than species composition, especially by environmental variables. Both species and guild richness were significantly correlated with most predictors. Notably, species richness scaled positively with latitude.
   Main conclusions Diatom species and guild composition varied substantially in response to local environment and climatic and spatial variables indicating both environmental and historical effects. Species composition discriminated the geographical regions better, while guild composition detected the environmental gradients better. This emphasizes the need to examine different levels of organization to gain a deeper understanding of the roles of environment versus history in structuring communities. These findings suggest that diatom species distributions are under strong microevolutionary constraints. Conversely, guild distributions are less dependent on historic factors and are driven primarily by the environment, which makes them better suited for research on global environmental change.

AB Most free-living planktonic cells are streamlined and in spite of their limitations in functional flexibility, their vast populations have radiated into a wide range of aquatic habitats. Here we compared the metabolic potential of subgroups in the Alphaproteobacteria lineage SAR11 adapted to marine and freshwater habitats. Our results suggest that the successful leap from marine to freshwaters in SAR11 was accompanied by a loss of several carbon degradation pathways and a rewiring of the central metabolism. Examples for these are C1 and methylated compounds degradation pathways, the Entner-Doudouroff pathway, the glyoxylate shunt and anapleuretic carbon fixation being absent from the freshwater genomes. Evolutionary reconstructions further suggest that the metabolic modules making up these important freshwater metabolic traits were already present in the gene pool of ancestral marine SAR11 populations. The loss of the glyoxylate shunt had already occurred in the common ancestor of the freshwater subgroup and its closest marine relatives, suggesting that the adaptation to freshwater was a gradual process. Furthermore, our results indicate rapid evolution of TRAP transporters in the freshwater clade involved in the uptake of low molecular weight carboxylic acids. We propose that such gradual tuning of metabolic pathways and transporters toward locally available organic substrates is linked to the formation of subgroups within the SAR11 clade and that this process was critical for the freshwater clade to find and fix an adaptive phenotype.

AB Global climate change will undoubtedly be a pressure on coastal marine ecosystems, affecting not only species distributions and physiology but also ecosystem functioning. In the coastal zone, the environmental variables that may drive ecological responses to climate change include temperature, wave energy, upwelling events and freshwater inputs, and all act and interact at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. To date, we have a poor understanding of how climate-related environmental changes may affect coastal marine ecosystems or which environmental variables are likely to produce priority effects. Here we use time series data (17years) of coastal benthic macrofauna to investigate responses to a range of climate-influenced variables including sea-surface temperature, southern oscillation indices (SOI, Z4), wind-wave exposure, freshwater inputs and rainfall. We investigate responses from the abundances of individual species to abundances of functional traits and test whether species that are near the edge of their tolerance to another stressor (in this case sedimentation) may exhibit stronger responses. The responses we observed were all nonlinear and some exhibited thresholds. While temperature was most frequently an important predictor, wave exposure and ENSO-related variables were also frequently important and most ecological variables responded to interactions between environmental variables. There were also indications that species sensitive to another stressor responded more strongly to weaker climate-related environmental change at the stressed site than the unstressed site. The observed interactions between climate variables, effects on key species or functional traits, and synergistic effects of additional anthropogenic stressors have important implications for understanding and predicting the ecological consequences of climate change to coastal ecosystems.

AB Plant functional types (or guilds) increasingly are being used to predict vegetation response to global changes. Continued human population growth coupled with projected warmer and drier climate will alter the hydrologic regimes of many arid-zone rivers, including intermittent rivers. We aimed to identify (i) woody plant guilds associated with distinct stream types of an arid region and (ii) plant traits indicating adaptation to the selective pressures of water availability and fluvial disturbance. We used hierarchical clustering to identify 11 plant guilds from floodplains, terraces and uplands of eight Arizona rivers that vary in surface flow permanence, depth to ground water and intensity of fluvial disturbance. Six guilds were riparian pioneers with small, wind-dispersed seeds, three guilds were late-seral, shade-tolerant riparian taxa with large animal-dispersed seeds, and two guilds were composed of desert xerophytes. Within the riparian pioneer and seral groups, guilds varied in water acquisition and productivity traits including wood density and rooting depth. The community-weighted traits varied or covaried with water availability and fluvial disturbance. Root: shoot ratio, canopy height and leaf area were influenced strongly by water availability, with the latter two showing a nonlinear response to changes in water table depth. Leaf length increased, and wood density decreased, as sites become wetter and more fluvially disturbed. Community-weighted seed mass, seed dispersal and spinesence varied most strongly with elevation above thalweg (an indicator of decreasing fluvial disturbance). These analyses will enable prediction of changes in the relative abundance of plant types and plant traits in response to changes in stream flow regimes, such as shifts towards greater intermittency. The distribution patterns of guilds among riparian habitat types emphasise the importance of focusing conservation efforts not only on the limited number of perennial rivers remaining in arid regions, but also on intermittent and ephemeral rivers with shallow water tables.

AB In river systems, aquatic invertebrate communities are surprisingly persistent over time and generally recover quickly from disturbances. Drift has long been viewed as the primary process promoting this resilience, and it plays a important role in predictive models of community composition and concepts in lotic ecology. More recently, other processes such as vertical migration from the hyporheic zone, aerial oviposition from distant refuges and the use of resistance forms (e.g. diapause) have received greater recognition and support for their importance. In this study, the view that drift is the primary process promoting invertebrate community resilience was challenged in an intermittent alluvial river using reach-scale flow manipulations. First, six treatment channels were completely dried for 1week, while three others were left flowing to be used as controls. Second, flow was re-established in channels and drift was either allowed or blocked for a 4-week period. Third, during this period the resilience of community structure, composition and function was compared between treatments, and the potential for colonisation from the drift, hyporheic zone, aerial oviposition and resistance forms was measured. Communities recovered after only 2weeks in all of the previously dried channels, and contrary to our hypotheses, invertebrate community structure, composition and functional trait composition were not altered by blocking drift, indicating it was not the primary process promoting resilience in this river. Three lines of evidence suggested colonisation from the hyporheic zone and not aerial oviposition nor resistance forms promoted resilience following rewetting including the following: (i) finding all common benthic taxa in the hyporheic zone during the drying event, (ii) a distinct decrease in invertebrate size upon rewetting in all treatment channels and (iii) a negative correlation between resilience and water table depth. This experiment highlighted the potential importance of the hyporheic zone as a key source of colonisation in alluvial rivers and emphasises the need for a three-dimensional perspective when considering community resilience in rivers. Adaptive management approaches are needed to direct attention to sources (e.g. hyporheic zone) that are essential to promoting community resilience in rivers facing increased pressures due to climate change, water abstraction and flow regime alteration.

AB The relationship between form and function is usually evident and reflect causal relationships in ecological interactions. However, the consistency of the taxonomical and functional approaches versus a morphological approach is yet to be assessed and applied to benthic-sediment relationships. Here, we propose a new functional classification based on morphological characteristics using polychaetes. To test the validity of the framework we assess the consistency between polychaete responses to distinct sedimentary environments using morphological, taxonomical and biological traits approaches, and comparing the patterns of polychaete responses at local and regional scales. The selected morphological characteristics were pharynx complexity, jaws presence, feeding palps, head appendages, body appendages, body support structures, branchiae and body regionalization, as well as number of segments, which were categorized according to presence, size, number or type of structure. The novel morphological method was successfully applied and all analyses showed consistent faunal patterns of variation along muddy and sandy habitats at the distinct spatial scales. Nevertheless, in the three case studies the morphological method explained more over the general variability and was more concise than the other two methods, emphasizing the reliability of a functional approach. The distinct set of morphological characteristics found in muddy and sandy habitats reflected two different ecological roles of polychaetes. Discretely motile, small sized and of low sensibility polychaetes prevailed in muddy habitats, while sandy sediments were dominated by organisms with richer and more heterogeneous characteristics. The responses of the morphological analysis were very similar to the taxonomical and biological traits analysis, but with a much higher explanatory power, meaning that morphology provides a robust approach for studying the ecological functionality of marine benthic systems.

AB Milk yield and quality has been a major selection criterion for genetic improvement in livestock species. Role of Prolactin gene in determining milk quality in terms of protein profile, lactose, lipids and other imperative macromolecules is very important. In this context, genetic profiling of Prolactin gene in riverine buffalo of Pakistan was performed and potential genetic markers were identified illustrating worth of this gene in marker-assisted selection of superior dairy buffaloes. Series of wet and dry lab experimentation was performed starting with genomic DNA isolation from true to breed representatives of indigenous river buffalo (Nili-Ravi). After amplification of coding regions of Prolactin gene, products were eluted and sequenced by Sanger's chain termination method and aligned to get variations in genomic region. A total of 15 novel variations were identified and analyzed statistically for their significance at population level, haplotypes were constructed, and association was estimated. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to evaluate the rate of evolution for Prolactin gene in various mammalian species. Lastly, biological networking for this molecule was predicted to get the bigger pictorial of its functional machinery. Pathway analysis was performed to find its physiological mode of action in milk synthesis. This is a first report toward complete genetic screening of Prolactin gene in Pakistani buffaloes. Results of this study not only provide an insight for potential role of Prolactin gene in milk-producing abilities of buffalo but also suggest new directions for exploration of more genes that may have promising role to enhance future milk production capabilities of river buffalo breeds of Asian region through marker-assisted selection.

AB Analyzing functional species' characteristics (species traits) that represent physiological, life history and morphological characteristics of species help understanding the impacts of various stressors on aquatic communities at field conditions. This research aimed to study the combined effects of pesticides and other environmental factors (temperature, dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, floating macrophytes cover, phosphate, nitrite, and nitrate) on the trait modality distribution of aquatic macrofauna communities. To this purpose, a field inventory was performed in a flower bulb growing area of the Netherlands with significant variation in pesticides pressures. Macrofauna community composition, water chemistry parameters and pesticide concentrations in ditches next to flower bulb fields were determined. Trait modalities of nine traits (feeding mode, respiration mode, locomotion type, resistance form, reproduction mode, life stage, voltinism, saprobity, maximum body size) likely to indicate pesticides impacts were analyzed. According to a redundancy analysis, phosphate -and not pesticides- constituted the main factor structuring the trait modality distribution of aquatic macrofauna. The functional composition could be ascribed for 2-4 % to pesticides, and for 3-11 % to phosphate. The lack of trait responses to pesticides may indicate that species may have used alternative strategies to adapt to ambient pesticides stress. Biomass of animals exhibiting trait modalities related to feeding by predation and grazing, presence of diapause form or dormancy, reproduction by free clutches and ovoviviparity, life stage of larvae and pupa, was negatively correlated to the concentration of phosphate. Hence, despite the high pesticide pollution in the area, variation in nutrient-related stressors seems to be the dominant driver of the functional composition of aquatic macrofauna assembly in agricultural ditches.

AB River buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) milk plays an important role in economy and nutritious diet in several developing countries. However, reliable milk-yield genomic markers and their functional insights remain unexposed. Here, we have used a target capture sequencing approach in three economically important buffalo breeds namely: Banni, Jafrabadi and Mehsani, belonging to either high or low milk-yield group. Blood samples were collected from the milk-yield/breed balanced group of 12 buffaloes, and whole exome sequencing was performed using Roche 454 GS-FLX Titanium sequencer. Using an innovative approach namely, MultiCom; we have identified high-quality SNPs specific for high and low-milk yield buffaloes. Almost 70% of the reported genes in QTL regions of milk-yield and milk-fat in cattle were present among the buffalo milk-yield gene candidates. Functional analysis highlighted transcriptional regulation category in the low milk-yield group, and several new pathways in the two groups. Further, the discovered SNP candidates may account for more than half of mammary transcriptome changes in high versus low-milk yielding cattle. Thus, starting from the design of a reliable strategy, we identified reliable genomic markers specific for high and low-milk yield buffalo breeds and addressed possible downstream effects.

AB We analyzed the effects of sewage discharge on a subtropical estuary by comparing the functional diversity of intertidal macroinvertebrate assemblages in contaminated with non-contaminated reference areas. Functional structure was assessed using biological traits analysis (BTA) and four multivariate indices (FRic, FEve, FDis and Rao's Q) of functional diversity. Our results showed clear and temporally consistent changes in macrobenthic functional structure in contaminated areas. However, these results depended on whether abundance- or biomass-based measurements were used, with abundance-based analyses distinguishing most clearly between sewage contamination conditions. Differences between contaminated and non-contaminated conditions were also displayed by BTA for all the functional trait categories. FDis (functional divergence) and Rao's Q (functional dispersion) were higher in the non contaminated condition and increased with higher benthic environmental health, as measured by the AMBI index. These patterns of higher functional divergence and dispersion were driven by the numerical dominance of opportunistic annelids in the contaminated condition. We suggest that abundance-based BTA, and the FDis and/or Rao's Q indices are reliable approaches to detect changes in functional structure with respect to sewage pollution. They have a great potential for environmental assessment and monitoring of subtropical estuarine ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study assessed the influence of the seasonal fluctuation of abiotic conditions (wet v. dry season) on the functional diversity (FD) of tropical coastal fish assemblages. Sampling was carried out in three regions of north-east Brazil with contrasting coastlines (influenced by reef, lagoon and estuary). In each region, fishes were sampled from three depth strata (10, 20 and 30m) and FD was estimated using an index based on key phenotypic and behavioural characteristics. All three regions had higher FD in the wet season at shallower depths, indicating the coexistence of species with low functional redundancy in sites subject to seasonal flushing of fresh water. Deeper sites had lower FD than shallower sites, although this difference was less pronounced for region 3, which is strongly affected by its proximity to the Sao Francisco estuary. The results broadly support the hypothesis that alterations in abiotic conditions in the wet season allow estuarine-adapted fishes with a different suite of functional traits to invade shallow coastal regions.

AB An aquatic gastropod belonging to the family Neritidae, Clithon retropictus is listed as an endangered class II species in South Korea. The lack of information on its genomic background limits the ability to obtain functional data resources and inhibits informed conservation planning for this species. In the present study, the transcriptomic sequencing and de novo assembly of C. retropictus generated a total of 241,696,750 high-quality reads. These assembled to 282,838 unigenes with mean and N50 lengths of 736.9 and 1201 base pairs, respectively. Of these, 125,616 unigenes were subjected to annotation analysis with known proteins in Protostome DB, COG, GO, and KEGG protein databases (BLASTX; E <= 0.00001) and with known nucleotides in the Unigene database (BLASTN; E <= 0.00001). The GO analysis indicated that cellular process, cell, and catalytic activity are the predominant GO terms in the biological process, cellular component, and molecular function categories, respectively. In addition, 2093 unigenes were distributed in 107 different KEGG pathways. Furthermore, 49,280 simple sequence repeats were identified in the unigenes (>1 kilobase sequences). This is the first report on the identification of transcriptomic and microsatellite resources for C. retropictus, which opens up the possibility of exploring traits related to the adaptation and acclimatization of this species.

AB Animal locomotory morphology, i.e. morphological features involved in locomotion, is under the influence of a diverse set of ecological and behavioral factors. In teleost fish, habitat choice and foraging strategy are major determinants of locomotory morphology. In this study, we assess the influence of habitat use and foraging strategy on important locomotory traits, namely the size of the pectoral and caudal fins and the weight of the pectoral fin muscles, as applied to one of the most astonishing cases of adaptive radiation: the species flock of cichlid fishes in East African Lake Tanganyika. We also examine the course of niche partitioning along two main habitat axes, the benthic vs. limnetic and the sandy vs. rocky substrate axis. The results are then compared with available data on the cichlid adaptive radiation of neighbouring Lake Malawi. We find that pectoral fin size and muscle weight correlate with habitat use within the water column, as well as with substrate composition and foraging strategies. Niche partitioning along the benthic-limnetic axis in Lake Tanganyikan cichlids seems to follow a similar course as in Lake Malawi, while the course of habitat use with respect to substrate composition appears to differ between the cichlid assemblages of these two lakes.

AB The ecological impact of fine sediments is one of the major causes of ecological degradation affecting lotic systems. Interestingly, many studies have investigated the impact of increased sediment loads on specific compartments of the lotic system, but little or no information is available about the overall impact of sedimentation. Aim of this paper was to analyse the influence of fine sedimentation on allochthonous and autochthonous energy inputs and on the structural and functional characteristics of diatom and macroinvertebrate communities. Data were collected in two Alpine streams in NW Italy, one interested by the presence of an intense mining area and the other pristine, used as a control. The two rivers greatly differed in terms of suspended solids and bed load characteristics. From 10 stations, we analysed main physico-chemical characteristics, fine sediment indicators (using 60 sediment traps), coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) and photosynthetic pigments amounts, taxonomic and functional characteristics of macroinvertebrate communities. We tested several causal models via path analysis. Functional traits seem to better reflect the integrated impact originating from quarries in the river basin than traditional community metrics like total abundance and specific richness. This outcome was enforced through the co-inertia analysis, which took in consideration also metrics based on diatom communities.

AB Research suggests that a positive relationship exists between diversity and ecological function, yet the multi-trophic effects of biodiversity remain poorly understood. The resource complementarity hypothesis suggests that increasing the trait diversity of resources provides a more complete diet for consumers, elevating consumer feeding rates. Whereas previous tests of this mechanism have measured trait diversity as the variation of single traits or the richness of functional groups, we employed a multivariate trait index to manipulate the chemical diversity of temperate tree litter species in outdoor pond mesocosms. We inoculated outdoor mesocosms with diverse and multi-trophic communities of microbial and macro-consumer species that rely on leaf litter for energy and nutrients. Litter was provided at three levels of chemical trait diversity, a constant level of species richness, and an equal representation of all litter species. Over three months, we measured more than 65 responses, and assessed the effects of litter chemical diversity and chemical trait means (i.e., community-weighted means). We found that litter chemical diversity positively correlated with decomposition rate of leaf litter, but had no effect on biomass or density of producers and consumers. However, the pond communities often responded to chemical trait means, particularly those related to nutrients, structure, and defense. Our results suggest that resource complementarity does have some effect on the release of energy and nutrients from decomposing substrates in forest ponds, but does not have multi-trophic effects. Our results further suggest that loss of tree biodiversity could affect forest ecosystem functionality, and particularly the processes occurring in and around ponds and wetlands.

AB Benthic invertebrate communities play a fundamental role in lake ecosystems, and the understanding of how those benthic communities are structured, particularly in terms of the identity and spatiotemporal distribution of their functional traits, is key to our understanding of how lake ecosystems work. In Takvatn, a subarctic lake in northern Norway, we identified the taxonomic and functional identity of the species characterizing benthic communities across three seasons and six different depths. Invertebrates were sampled using vacuum pump and Ekman grab. Despite the relative low species richness, we found large variation across depths and seasons in species functional composition using multivariate analyses. In all seasons and habitats, gathering traits were the most common feeding traits within the benthic community. The upper littoral habitat shifted from a community characterized by particle gathers and algal scrapers in spring and summer, to a community largely characterized by leaf shredders in autumn. There was also high relative occurrence of predator traits towards the deeper areas of the littoral zone, as well as in the sub-littoral and profundal habitats. The deeper habitats showed high variation in their taxonomic composition, but a stable composition of functional traits throughout all seasons. In conclusion, our study demonstrates large spatio-temporal differences in functional trait diversity and composition of the benthic invertebrates in Takvatn.

AB Understanding the role of species traits in chemical exposure is crucial for bioaccumulation and toxicity assessment of chemicals. We measured and modelled bioaccumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Chironomus riparius, Hyalella azteca, Lumbriculus variegatus and Sphaerium corneum. We used a battery test procedure with multiple enclosures in one aquarium, which maximized uniformity of exposure for the different species, such that the remaining variability was due mostly to species traits. The relative importance of uptake from either pore water or sediment ingestion was manipulated by using 28 d aged standard OECD sediment with low (1%) and medium (5%) OM content and 13 months aged sediment with medium OM (5%) content. Survival was >= 76% and wet weight increased for all species. Reproduction of H. azteca and weight gain of H. azteca and S. corneum were significantly higher in the medium OM aged sediments than in other sediments, perhaps due to a more developed microbial community (i.e., increase in food resources). Biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF) ranged from 3 to 114, depending on species and PCB congener, with C riparius (3-10)< S. corneum (10-17) <= L. variegatus (7-61) <= H. Azteca (5-114), thus challenging the presumed value of 1-2 typically employed in ecological risk assessment schemes. BSAFs for freshwater taxonomic groups were compared with their marine counterparts and showed overlapping values. The dynamic bioaccumulation model with species-specific bioaccumulation parameters fitted well to the experimental data and showed that bioaccumulation parameters were depended on species traits. Enclosure-based battery tests and mechanistic BSAF models are expected to improve the quality of the exposure assessment in whole sediment toxicity tests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surface water connectivity can influence the richness and composition of fish assemblages, particularly in harsh environments where colonisation factors and access to seasonal refugia are required for species persistence. Studies regarding influence of connectivity on Arctic fish distributions are limited and are rarely applied to whole assemblage patterns. To increase our understanding of how surface water connectivity and related hydrologic variables influence assemblage patterns, we investigated species richness and composition of Arctic lake fishes over a large region, 8500km(2), of the central Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska. We collected fish presence/non-detection data from 102 lakes and used a hierarchical multispecies occupancy framework to derive species richness and inform species composition patterns. Our mean estimate of regional richness was 12.3 (SD 0.5) species. Presence of a permanent channel connection was an overriding factor affecting species richness (mean 3.6, 95% CI 3.1-4.9), presumably driving lake colonisation potential. In lakes without a permanent channel connection, data suggest richness (mean 2.0, 95% CI 1.7-3.3) increased with the availability of in-lake winter refugia and with the potential of ephemeral connections during spring floods. Fish species functional traits and environmental faunal filters contributed to patterns of richness and assemblage composition. Composition corresponded with richness in a coherent manner, where each successive level of richness contained several discrete assemblages that showed similar responses to the environment. Lakes with permanent channel connections contained both widespread and restricted species, while the species-poor lakes that lacked a connection contained mainly widespread species. This work provides useful baseline information on the processes that drive the relations between patch connectivity and fish species richness and assemblage composition. The environmental processes that organise fish assemblages in Arctic lakes are likely to change in a warming climate.

AB Residential shoreline and watershed development by humans are leading agents of environmental change in lake ecosystems that reduce abundances and diversity of littoral invertebrates. Invertebrate functional and life history traits are robust indicators of environmental quality and ecosystem functioning, yet surprisingly few studies have utilized trait-based approaches to assess impacts of human development to lake littoral communities. We assessed environmental characteristics of human development that impact functional diversity and structure the trait composition of invertebrate communities in lakes of northwestern United States. Multiple linear regressions revealed that functional diversity declined with increasing watershed development, lake total phosphorus, and littoral macrophyte cover. Results from multivariate constrained ordination and fourth corner analysis indicated that high phosphorus concentrations and abundant macrophyte cover removed taxa with semivoltine life histories and filter feeders from lake communities, and that both regional ecosystem and local habitat characteristics of human development were important determinants of invertebrate community structure. Human development had particularly pronounced effects on invertebrate communities in the sublittoral zone, for which overall community abundances declined. Our study indicates that human development favors lake communities dominated by multivoltine taxa and herbivores, which may have important implications for energy flow among terrestrial, littoral, and pelagic food webs.

AB The ecological process of community assembly is described as the succession of three phases: colonization, regulation and segregation. Early colonization remains the least studied and quantified phase of assembly. In order to fill this gap, an approach combining in situ experiments and modelling was proposed to study colonization by a benthic macrofauna community in open microcosms containing a single, non-limiting resource. The experiment was three months long. A total of 51 taxa were observed in the microcosms, but data analyses of the species composition and abundances revealed that five species, Capitella spp., Gammaropsis maculata, Erichtionus punctatus, Nereiphylla paretti and Harmothoe mariannae, explained most of the observed variation in the assembly process. The population dynamics of these species were simulated taking into account functional traits that govern individual interactions. The dynamic model simulated a demographic stochasticity due to low population densities that result from the small size of the experimental microcosms. Using this combined approach of experiments and modelling, we showed that predation interactions alone can account for the abundances and species composition of primary consumers during the transient phase of early colonization.

AB The Northern Gulf of California (NGC) is a mega diverse area of high endemism with major economic interest because of the multi-specific fisheries developed, mainly shrimp. There is a lack of recent studies on bycatch fish assemblages, so during the fishing seasons from 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, on board 13 shrimp boats, 14 commercial fishing trips were performed from 5 m - 90 m in depth with a total of 119 catches. The 119 catches were analyzed to assess fish community structure using taxonomic diversity indices to detect changes in the community following the taxonomic distinctness average Delta+ and the diversity index Delta* (TAXDEST of the PRIMER v6 program). To confirm the structure of functional groups, we considered similarities of ecologic and morphologic traits among species. The results showed that the indices Delta+ and Delta* were within the expected average and confidence intervals at 95%, finding significant differences between the indices. The analyses showed a well-structured community because of the great variety of forms and functions of the species within the community. In the community of the functional groups, reproduction was the ecological attribute that contributed the most to their structure. The community structure was represented by intermediate trophic levels (3-3.9), preferably primary and secondary carnivores within the trophic categories of predators of benthic ichthyo-fauna that belong to demersal species of soft bottoms and mostly fusiform body. To conclude, the NGC showed high functional redundancy according to the estimated functional groups, thus the ecosystem was considered stable and with great diversity. This type of studies should be followed using fishing and environmental effort due to the great biological and ecologic importance in the area.

AB The macroinvertebrates are a vital component of freshwater ecosystems as they contribute to the process of organic matter while serving as food for other organisms such as fish and amphibians. Unfortunately, the knowledge of the aquatic diversity is poor in the high Andean systems (between 3 200 and 5 200 m.a.s.l. and rainfall below 300 mm per year), especially in the Argentinean peatbogs, a fact which has made difficult the interpretation of spatial patterns on a regional scale. The present study aimed to describe the composition of aquatic macroinvertebrates in seven peatbogs in the Argentinean Puna, and to analyze for the first time their spatial patterns. For this, we studied the relationship of these organisms with the environment, and obtained information about the surrounding vegetation and water physico-chemical characteristics. A total of 3 131 specimens of aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected, representing 25 taxa belonging to 22 families and 24 genera. In addition, 62 species of vascular plants were recorded, belonging to 20 families. The most abundant life form were the tufted grasses, followed by cushions. By using an NMDS (Non-Metrical Multidimensional Scaling) statistical analysis, the sampling sites were ordered in each peatbog as follows. The peatbogs located furthest West and South with higher water temperature were grouped on axis 1, whereas those with higher conductivity, whole water dissolved solids and salt concentration were grouped on axis 2. The water temperature was higher than air temperature at all times, and we found no association between temperature and altitude. The altitude had no correlation with the abundance of macroinvertebrates or with plant richness. Life forms such as scattered graminoids, trailing and prostrate herbs (in many cases they get into the channel) and aquatic plants were more abundant in peatbogs 4, 5 and 7 and they had a correlation with some macroinvertebrates belonging to functional trophic groups such as filter-collectors, collectors and scrapers. Finally, conductivity, whole dissolved solids and salt concentration had their highest value in peatbog 6, where Bivalvia (filter-collector) and Hyalella (collector) were also found. The results obtained attest that these macroinvertebrates displayed diversity and composition spatial patterns, the most important feature being their relationship with the surrounding vegetation, and to a lesser extent, with the physical and chemical traits of water in seven fertile lowlands in the Argentinean Puna.

AB Characterizing the impacts of hydrologic alterations, pollutants, and habitat degradation on macroinvertebrate species assemblages is of critical value for managers wishing to categorize stream ecosystem condition. A combination of approaches including trait-based metrics and traditional bioassessments provides greater information, particularly in anthropogenic stream ecosystems where traditional approaches can be confounded by variously interacting land use impacts. Macroinvertebrates were collected from two rural and three urban nested study sites in central Missouri, USA during the spring and fall seasons of 2011. Land use responses of conventional taxonomic and trait-based metrics were compared to streamflow indices, physical habitat metrics, and water quality indices. Results show that biotic index was significantly different (p < 0.05) between sites with differences detected in 54 % of trait-based metrics. The most consistent response to urbanization was observed in size metrics, with significantly (p < 0.05) fewer small bodied organisms. Increases in fine stream-bed sediment, decreased submerged woody rootmats, significantly higher winter Chloride concentrations, and decreased mean suspended sediment particle size in lower urban stream reaches also influenced macroinvertebrate assemblages. Riffle habitats in urban reaches contained 21 % more (p = 0.03) multivoltine organisms, which was positively correlated to the magnitude of peak flows (r(2) = 0.91, p = 0.012) suggesting that high flow events may serve as a disturbance in those areas. Results support the use of macroinvertebrate assemblages and multiple stressors to characterize urban stream system condition and highlight the need to better understand the complex interactions of trait-based metrics and anthropogenic aquatic ecosystem stressors.

AB 1. Understanding and predicting ecosystem responses to multiple environmental pressures is a long-standing interest in ecology and environmental management. However, few studies have examined how the functional features of freshwater biological communities vary along multiple gradients of environmental stress. Furthermore, modelling these functional features for a whole river network constitutes a strong potential basis to improve ecosystem management.
   2. We explored how functional redundancy of biological communities (FR, a functional feature related to the stability, resistance and resilience of ecosystems) responds to single and multiple environmental filters. We compared these responses with those of functional richness, evenness and divergence. We used riparian vegetation of a Mediterranean basin, and three of the main environmental filters affecting freshwater communities in such regions, that is drought, flow regulation and agricultural intensity, thus considering the potential effect of natural environmental variability. We also assessed the predictability of FR and estimated it for the entire river network.
   3. We found that all functional measures decreased with increasing environmental filter intensity. However, FR was more sensitive to single and multiple environmental filters compared to other functional measures. The best-fitting model explained 59% of the FR variability and included agriculture, drought and flow regulation and the pairwise interactions of agriculture with drought and flow regulation. The parameters of the FR models differed from null model expectations reflecting a non-random decline along stress gradients.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We found non-random detrimental effects along environmental filters' gradients for riparian functional redundancy (the most sensitive functional index), meaning that increased stress could jeopardize stability, resistance and resilience of these systems. In general, agriculture caused the greatest impact on functional redundancy and functional diversity measures, being the most important stressor for riparian functionality in the study area. Temporary streams flowing through an agricultural, regulated basin had reduced values of functional redundancy, whereas the free-flowing medium-sized, perennial water courses flowing through unaltered sub-basins displayed higher values of functional redundancy and potentially greater stability against human impacts. All these findings along with the predicted basin-wide variation of functional redundancy can assist environmental managers in improving monitoring and ecosystem management.

AB Human land uses and population growth represent major global threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services. Understanding how biological communities respond to multiple drivers of human-induced environmental change is fundamental for conserving ecosystems and remediating degraded habitats. Here, we used a replicated 'real-world experiment' to study the responses of invertebrate communities to wastewater perturbations across a land-use intensity gradient in 12 Swiss streams. We used different taxonomy and trait-based community descriptors to establish the most sensitive indicators detecting impacts and to help elucidate potential causal mechanisms of change. First, we predicted that streams in catchments adversely impacted by human land-uses would be less impaired by wastewater inputs because their invertebrate communities should be dominated by pollution-tolerant taxa ('environmental context'). Second, we predicted that the negative effects of wastewater on stream invertebrate communities should be larger in streams that receive proportionally more wastewater ('magnitude of disturbance'). In support of the 'environmental context' hypothesis, we found that change in the Saprobic Index (a trait-based indicator of tolerance to organic pollution) was associated with upstream community composition; communities in catchments with intensive agricultural land uses (e.g., arable cropping and pasture) were generally more resistant to eutrophication associated with wastewater inputs. We also found support for the 'magnitude of disturbance' hypothesis. The SPEAR Index (a trait-based indicator of sensitivity to pesticides) was more sensitive to the relative input of effluent, suggesting that toxic influences of wastewater scale with dilution. Whilst freshwater pollution continues to be a major environmental problem, our findings highlight that the same anthropogenic pressure (i.e., inputs of wastewater) may induce different ecological responses depending on the environmental context and community metrics used. Thus, remediation strategies aiming to improve stream ecological status (e.g., rehabilitating degraded reaches) need to consider upstream anthropogenic influences and the most appropriate indicators of restoration success.

AB The adaptive landscape provides the foundational bridge between micro- and macroevolution. One well-known caveat to this perspective is that fitness surfaces depend on ecological context, including competitor frequency, traits measured, and resource abundance. However, this view is based largely on intraspecific studies. It is still unknown how context-dependence affects the larger features of peaks and valleys on the landscape which ultimately drive speciation and adaptive radiation. Here, I explore this question using one of the most complex fitness landscapes measured in the wild in a sympatric pupfish radiation endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas by tracking survival and growth of laboratory-reared F2 hybrids. I present new analyses of the effects of competitor frequency, dietary isotopes, and trait subsets on this fitness landscape. Contrary to expectations, decreasing competitor frequency increased survival only among very common phenotypes, whereas less common phenotypes rarely survived despite few competitors, suggesting that performance, not competitor frequency, shapes large-scale features of the fitness landscape. Dietary isotopes were weakly correlated with phenotype and growth, but did not explain additional survival variation. Nonlinear fitness surfaces varied substantially among trait subsets, revealing one-, two-, and three-peak landscapes, demonstrating the complexity of selection in the wild, even among similar functional traits.

AB Migratory animals can have profound impacts on ecosystem structure and function. In streams, salmon are well known for their contrasting influences on primary productivity through nutrient delivery, which enhances potential productivity, and substrate disturbance during nest building, which reduces algal biomass and primary production. However, most migratory fish species neither disturb the substrate significantly nor die en masse after spawning, hence their influence on ecosystems may differ from that observed in salmon streams. To determine the influence of nutrient subsidies from migrations of iteroparous fish whose broadcast spawning does not disturb the substrate substantially, we compared nutrient limitation, nutrient concentrations, and stream metabolism during spawning migrations of suckers (Catostomus spp.) in Lake Michigan tributaries with and without migration barriers. Although suckers deliver both nitrogen and phosphorus as eggs and waste excretion, only nitrogen concentrations were elevated during the migration (NH4-N rose 44% relative to sites without a sucker run). Nutrient diffusing substrates demonstrated P-limitation during the migration at sites spanning a wide range of sucker abundance, suggesting that high demand for likely masked P inputs from fish. Time series analyses indicated that gross primary production (GPP) increased with sucker excretion, but not with egg deposition after accounting for abiotic conditions. In contrast, egg deposition, but not excretion, was associated with a slight increase in ecosystem respiration (ER), suggesting that sucker gametes provide labile carbon that contributes to ER. The effects of suckers contrast with ecosystem responses to salmon migrations, which elevate ER but have mixed effects on GPP. This disparity reflects the fact that suckers fertilize streams without attendant disturbance effects. Our results suggest that basic differences in life history and behavior of migratory fish determine the direction and magnitude of their ecosystem effects. As a result, broad trait-based predictions of the ecosystem role of migratory fishes may become possible as more species are studied.

AB Molecular genetic data suggest that June sucker (Chasmistes liorus) is only shallowly diverged from the co-occurring but phenotypically distinct Utah sucker (Catostomus ardens) in Utah Lake. Phenotypes representing both extreme morphologies (June sucker and Utah sucker) are observed in the small wild population, but relatively large numbers of intermediate phenotypes are also present. This relatively continuous variation between the two putative species could result from extensive hybridization (including reticulate evolutionary patterns) of genetically based phenotypes or incomplete divergence among lineages and extensive phenotypic plasticity with little genetic basis. To help inform the evolutionary history of June sucker and to provide critical information for management and restoration of June sucker populations, we evaluated the distribution of shape phenotypes among purebreds of each species and their hybrids and determined the heritability of shape and ecological performance between June sucker (C. liorus) and its sister species Utah sucker (C. ardens). Mouth shape of purebred June sucker and Utah sucker are located at the extremes, and hybrids are located midway between the purebreds. Multivariate heritability was relatively high for mouth shape at 0.27. Heritability for growth rate was high at 0.32-0.42, but variation was not associated with cross type. Genetically based variation in mouth shape has evolved fairly rapidly or has been maintained in the face of ongoing hybridization between the two species. Currently, there seems to be little evidence for differential selection between species that would maintain shape variation.

AB Floodplains and crops are particularly susceptible to alien plant invasion, often leading to negative ecologic and economic impacts. As irrigated crops and riparian habitats are interconnected at the landscape scale, plant species of each habitat may be susceptible to colonizing the other. In order to avoid alien plant invasions of natural habitats and surrounding crops and to develop management practices to face this problem, it is not only essential to understand which traits favour the success of alien plants in irrigated crops and floodplains, but also whether a flow of species between these two habitats actually exists. With this aim, floristic surveys were carried out on riparian habitats (riparian forest, reedbed and muddy line) and on irrigated orchards at a gradient of distance from the river. Differences in weed management techniques applied in orchards were taken into account during the surveys. Plant diversity, composition and invasion levels were evaluated for each habitat and differences in floristic composition were interpreted in terms of functional traits. Natural habitats were well differentiated from crops in terms of native plants, but when considering alien plants, muddy line and flood irrigated orchards showed similar floristic composition. Alien plant community in the muddy line was a subset of that of flooded orchards and it was composed by C4 species, with clonal growth, perennial graminoids and water seed dispersal. This work proves that, unlike native species, alien species are shared between irrigated orchards and adjacent floodplains, which is favoured by a set of traits that allows them to colonize and establish new populations there. These results can help to develop strategies for preventing the establishment of alien plants in these habitats and to manage already present populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Species interactions can be important mediators of community and ecosystem responses to environmental stressors. However, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of the indirect ecological effects of stress that arise via altered species interactions. To understand how species interactions will be altered by environmental stressors, we need to know if the species that are vulnerable to such stressors also have large impacts on the ecosystem. As predators often exhibit certain traits that are linked to a high vulnerability to stress (e.g., large body size, long generation time), as well as having large effects on communities (e.g., top-down trophic effects), predators may be particularly likely to mediate ecological effects of environmental stress. Other functional groups, like facilitators, are known to have large impacts on communities, but their vulnerability to perturbations remains undocumented. Here, we use aquatic insect communities in bromeliads to examine the indirect effects of an important stressor (drought) on community and ecosystem responses. In a microcosm experiment, we manipulated predatory and facilitative taxa under a range of experimental droughts, and quantified effects on community structure and ecosystem function. Drought, by adversely affecting the top predator, had indirect cascading effects on the entire food web, altering community composition and decomposition. We identified the likely pathway of how drought cascaded through the food web from the top-down as drought -> predator -> shredder -> decomposition. This stress-induced cascade depended on predators exhibiting both a strong vulnerability to drought and large impacts on prey (especially shredders), as well as shredders exhibiting high functional importance as decomposers.

AB Metacommunities are spatially structured communities linked by dispersal. They provide a connection between local community assembly and regional-level processes. One of the more widely used methods to address questions related to metacommunity concepts is those that characterize elements of metacommunity structure by quantifying aspects of coherence, species turnover, and boundary clumping. In this study, we used this approach to study the spatial ecology of freshwater fishes in Texas. Stream-fish assemblages in Texas provide an excellent opportunity to examine the patterns of metacommunity structure due to the number of drainages that empty directly into the Gulf of Mexico, which minimizes the likelihood of dispersal between basins while allowing for longitudinal movement within basins. We used fisheries data published by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and from the North American Water Quality Association, which consisted of 94 sampling localities distributed across 18 river basins and 11 ecoregions. To examine within-basin patterns, we focused only on the Brazos, Colorado, and Trinity rivers because of the number of sites within each of these basins. From a taxonomic standpoint, we consistently observed Clementsian patterns regardless of whether it was among or within river basins, whereas we mostly observed Gleasonian patterns from a functional perspective. Only one functional group was found at all sites in each of the three main river basins, which consisted of invertivores with an equilibrium life-history strategy. Various bioclimatic variables were significantly correlated with metacommunity structure, but these correlations differed between taxonomic and functional organization and differed depending on which river basin was considered. The results of this study support previous findings that species composition and functional traits relate to environmental gradients, but further our understanding by providing additional evidence that species sorting processes are the dominant structuring mechanisms.

AB Despite the fundamental role of river flow in determining the structure and function of lotic ecosystems, few studies have directly related features of the natural flow regime to variation in stream invertebrate assemblage composition. We classified 240 near-pristine, snowmelt-dominated Finnish streams into hydrological river types. We assessed the relationship of these types with benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and examined the relative importance of hydrological variables, local-habitat variables, and geographical location in predicting variation in assemblage structure. We used a hydrological model to obtain site-specific daily discharges for a 30-y period (1981-2010) and calculated 223 flow indices based on flow index modeling tools. We used a combination of principal component and cluster analysis to classify the sites into 6 distinct hydrological types that were separated mainly by geographical location and catchment-size-related factors. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and multiresponse permutation procedure showed that macroinvertebrate assemblage structure differed significantly among the hydrological types, but the associated A-statistic indicated wide variation among sites within type. Redundancy analysis indicated that assemblage structure was related more closely to hydrological variables than to local habitat and spatial variables. The role of hydrology was confirmed further by functional trait structure that showed close relationships to hydrological variables in three-table ordination (RLQ) and fourth-corner analyses. Traits representing organism size and microhabitat preference were correlated most closely with hydrological variables describing variability or seasonality of flows. Our study highlights the role of hydrology in structuring stream assemblages in seasonal, snowmelt-dominated river systems. Modeling hydrological variables in combination with species distribution models may provide a tool for predicting future changes in species distributions in stream ecosystems.

AB Aluminum sulfate (alum) has been applied in hundreds of eutrophic lakes and wetlands worldwide for >4 decades to inactivate internal P loading and to reduce potentially toxic cyanobacteria blooms. However, the ecological effects of alum additions on benthic invertebrate activities and the feedback effect of invertebrate bioturbation on alum effectiveness in binding P are not well known. We conducted a microcosm experiment to assess how functional traits of bioturbating invertebrates (chironomid larvae and tubificid oligochaetes) interact with sediment characteristics and alum addition to influence P fluxes in sediment cores from 3 eutrophic, flooded muck fields (former natural wetlands converted to celery fields, now being restored to wetlands). In the absence of alum, bioturbation activities by chironomids (tube builders and ventilators) stimulated P release from the sediment to the overlying water, whereas tubificids (gallery creators and producers of fecal pellets at the sediment surface) increased P retention in sediment cores from the 2 highest organic muck fields. The addition of alum induced a sharp reduction of P concentration in the water column of all treated cores, and bioturbation activity had little overall effect on alum's ability to prevent P release from sediments. Only tubificid activity in the most organic sediment resulted in a small but statistically significant release of P to the water column. Chironomid larvae and tubificid worms are usually the most dominant taxa in nutrient-enriched ecosystems, so understanding their interactions with alum and habitat characteristics can be important for identifying the ecological consequences of restoration practices in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems.

AB Recent years have seen considerable advances in ecological understanding of the functional role(s) of biodiversity and the connections between biodiversity, ecosystem function and ecosystem service provision Functional approaches have become important tools for simplifying biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships, but they also have some obvious weaknesses, In particular, since analyses that use functional groups treat members of a group as ecologically interchangeable, functional groups must be defined at a level that simplifies ecological complexity yet retains key ecological distinctions between groups of species. We developed a data-driven approach to functional group definition and applied it to a case study of 16 species of seed -dispersing Afrotropical waterfowl for which we created seed dispersal functional groups using both a priori categories, as typically done in previous studies, and a hierarchical clustering approach. Relevant functional differences and similarities occur among the waterfowl, particularly in the types of plant family dispersed. We found evidence for at least five functional groups of seed disperser. The different groupings have important implications for both wetland and terrestrial plant dispersal. Our analysis suggests that even for a relatively data-scarce study system, using a data-driven approach to generate functional groups offers a feasible and ecologically rigorous approach and is a useful alternative to simple a priori classification schemes. Our approach is capable of capturing variation across several functional traits and suggests that existing datasets may be useful in exploring variation in biodiversity ecosystem function relationships. Since functional classification schemes may affect our conclusions about biodiversity, ecosystem function and ecosystem service provision, considerable care should be given to ensuring that functional groups are not defined in such a way as to mask important ecological differences among supposedly similar species.

AB Modification of streams and rivers has mediated range expansions of several species into areas beyond their natural distribution. In this study, a newly created secondary floodplain channel (SFC), with three connections to the Danube, was used as a model system to compare colonisation by indigenous versus non-indigenous species of macroinvertebrates. Three years after the opening of the channel, it was colonised by 210 taxa. Indigenous species were more abundant than non-indigenous ones, both in the channel as well as in the Danube, and colonisation was mostly determined by habitat characteristics. In non-indigenous species, proximity to the source habitat was the main explanatory variable. Non-indigenous colonisers mostly had indifferent functional traits, in contrast to indigenous macroinvertebrates. These differences were particularly pronounced in amphipods where an equal number of five species per group occurred. The results of this study suggest that the factors determining colonisation patterns of indigenous versus non-indigenous species with similar dispersal abilities can strongly differ. Consequently, the creation of specific habitat structures (gravel-dominated, high current flow, bank vegetation) in restoration of floodplain channels can increase competitiveness of native species valued in conservation, particularly if sufficiently long channels with limited edge effects to the source habitat are built.

AB Well-informed river management decisions rely on an explicit statement of objectives, repeatable analyses, and a transparent system for assessing trade-offs. These components may then be applied to compare alternative operational regimes for water resource infrastructure (e.g., diversions, locks, and dams). Intra- and inter-annual hydrologic variability further complicates these already complex environmental flow decisions. Effective discharge analysis (developed in studies of geomorphology) is a powerful tool for integrating temporal variability of flow magnitude and associated ecological consequences. Here, we adapt the effectiveness framework to include multiple elements of the natural flow regime (i.e., timing, duration, and rate-of-change) as well as two flow variables. We demonstrate this analytical approach using a case study of environmental flow management based on long-term (60 years) daily discharge records in the Middle Oconee River near Athens, GA, USA. Specifically, we apply an existing model for estimating young-of-year fish recruitment based on flow-dependent metrics to an effective discharge analysis that incorporates hydrologic variability and multiple focal taxa. We then compare three alternative methods of environmental flow provision. Percentage-based withdrawal schemes outcompete other environmental flow methods across all levels of water withdrawal and ecological outcomes.

AB We report on fine taxonomic and functional analyses of polychaetes associated with rocky reefs along a gradient of ocean acidification (OA) at the volcanic CO2 vent system off the Castello Aragonese (Ischia Island, Italy). Percent cover of algae and sessile invertebrates (a determinant of polychaete distribution) was classified into functional groups to disentangle the direct effects of low pH on polychaete abundance from the indirect effects of pH on habitat and other species associations. A total of 6459 polychaete specimens belonging to 83 taxa were collected. Polychaete species richness and abundance dramatically dropped under the extreme low pH conditions due to the disappearance of both calcifying and non-calcifying species. Differences in distribution patterns indicate that the decreasing pH modified the structure and biological traits of polychaete assemblages independent of changes in habitat. A detailed taxonomic analysis highlighted species-specific responses to OA, with closely related species having opposing responses to decreasing pH. This resulted in an increase in the abundance of filter feeders and herbivores with decreasing pH, while sessile polychaetes disappeared in the extreme low pH zones, and were replaced by discretely motile forms. Reproductive traits of the polychaete assemblages changed as well, with brooding species dominating the most acidified zones. The few taxa that were abundant in extreme low pH conditions showed high tolerance to OA (e.g. Amphiglena mediterranea, Syllis prolifera, Platynereis cf. dumerilii, Parafabricia mazzellae, Brifacia aragonensis), and are promising models for further studies on the responses of benthic organisms to the effects of reduced pH.

AB The sensory trap model of signal evolution hypothesizes that signalers adapt to exploit a cue used by the receiver in another context. Although exploitation of receiver biases can result in conflict between the sexes, deceptive signaling systems that are mutually beneficial drive the evolution of stable communication systems. However, female responses in the nonsexual and sexual contexts may become uncoupled if costs are associated with exhibiting a similar response to a trait in both contexts. Male sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) signal with a mating pheromone, 3-keto petromyzonol sulfate (3kPZS), which may be a match to a juvenile cue used by females during migration. Upstream movement of migratory lampreys is partially guided by 3kPZS, but females only move toward 3kPZS with proximal accuracy during spawning. Here, we use in-stream behavioral assays paired with gonad histology to document the transition of female preference for juvenile-and male-released 3kPZS that coincides with the functional shift of 3kPZS as a migratory cue to a mating pheromone. Females became increasingly biased toward the source of synthesized 3kPZS as their maturation progressed into the reproductive phase, at which point, a preference for juvenile odor (also containing 3kPZS naturally) ceased to exist. Uncoupling of female responses during migration and spawning makes the 3kPZS communication system a reliable means of synchronizing mate search. The present study offers a rare example of a transition in female responses to a chemical cue between nonsexual and sexual contexts, provides insights into the origins of stable communication signaling systems.

AB The giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, a sexually dimorphic decapod crustacean is currently the world's most economically important cultured freshwater crustacean species. Despite its economic importance, there is currently a lack of genomic resources available for this species, and this has limited exploration of the molecular mechanisms that control the M. rosenbergii sex-differentiation system more widely in freshwater prawns. Here, we present the first hybrid transcriptome from M. rosenbergii applying RNA-Seq technologies directed at identifying genes that have potential functional roles in reproductive-related traits. A total of 13,733,210 combined raw reads (1720 Mbp) were obtained from Ion-Torrent PGM and 454 FLX. Bioinformatic analyses based on three state-of-the-art assemblers, the CLC GenomicWorkbench, Trans-ABySS, and Trinity, that use single and multiple k-mer methods respectively, were used to analyse the data. The influence of multiple k-mers on assembly performance was assessed to gain insight into transcriptome assembly from short reads. After optimisation, de novo assembly resulted in 44,407 contigs with a mean length of 437 bp, and the assembled transcripts were further functionally annotated to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms and simple sequence repeat motifs. Gene expression analysis was also used to compare expression patterns from ovary and testis tissue libraries to identify genes with potential roles in reproduction and sex differentiation. The large transcript set assembled here represents the most comprehensive set of transcriptomic resources ever developed for reproduction traits in M. rosenbergii, and the large number of genetic markers predicted should constitute an invaluable resource for future genetic research studies on M. rosenbergii and can be applied more widely on other freshwater prawn species in the genus Macrobrachium.

AB Hydrology is the main environmental filter in aquatic ecosystems and may result in shared tolerances and functional traits among species in disparate ecosystems. We analyzed the associations between taxonomic and functional facets of diversity within aquatic ecosystems (ponds vs. streams) across a hydroperiod gradient (1-365 d) to untangle the hydrologic drivers of aquatic invertebrate diversity. We used invertebrate assemblage data from seven arid-land streams in southeastern Arizona, United States collected over 2 yr and nine temperate woodland ponds in Ontario, Canada collected over 2 yr. Our results showed that although invertebrate assemblages from streams and ponds differ taxonomically, hydroperiod had similar influence on invertebrate trait structure regardless of biogeographic and habitat differences. Streams and ponds independently showed strong positive relationships between functional richness and taxonomic richness; however, the relationship showed a shallower slope in ponds, indicating higher functional redundancy. Intermittent ponds and streams tended to have lower functional and taxonomic richness than their perennial counterparts, but harbored greater beta diversity. Our results suggest that even though ponds and streams are fundamentally different habitats with distinct faunas and unique ecological processes, hydrology produces convergent patterns in both trait composition and diversity patterns.

AB Functional traits are growing in popularity in modern ecology, but feeding studies remain primarily rooted in a taxonomic-based perspective. However, consumers do not have any reason to select their prey using a taxonomic criterion, and prey assemblages are variable in space and time, which makes taxon-based studies assemblage-specific. To illustrate the benefits of the trait-based approach to assessing food choice, we studied the feeding ecology of the endangered freshwater fish Barbus meridionalis. We hypothesized that B. meridionalis is a selective predator which food choice depends on several prey morphological and behavioral traits, and thus, its top-down pressure may lead to changes in the functional composition of in-stream macroinvertebrate communities. Feeding selectivity was inferred by comparing taxonomic and functional composition (13 traits) between ingested and free-living potential prey using the Jacob's electivity index. Our results showed that the fish diet was influenced by 10 of the 13 traits tested. Barbus meridionalis preferred prey with a potential size of 5-10 mm, with a medium-high drift tendency, and that drift during daylight. Potential prey with no body flexibility, conical shape, concealment traits (presence of nets and/or cases, or patterned coloration), and high aggregation tendency had a low predation risk. Similarly, surface swimmers and interstitial taxa were low vulnerable to predation. Feeding selectivity altered the functional composition of the macroinvertebrate communities. Fish absence favored taxa with weak aggregation tendency, weak flexibility, and a relatively large size (10-20 mm of potential size). Besides, predatory invertebrates may increase in fish absence. In conclusion, our study shows that the incorporation of the trait-based approach in diet studies is a promising avenue to improve our mechanistic understanding of predator-prey interactions and to help predict the ecological outcomes of predator invasions and extinctions.

AB Although sparsely populated, the progressive degradation of Mongolia's rivers, lakes and groundwater, driven by land-use changes, poses a key challenge for the future sustainable development of the country. This paper deciphers the cause-effect-response chain between river bank degradation, changes of the ecological status, declines of ecosystem functions and priority measures with the case of the Kharaa River in Northern Mongolia. The underlying research approach comprised: (1) hydromorphological characterisation of the Kharaa River, (2) water quality assessments, (3) determination of the riverbed composition including hyporheic zone properties, (4) the analysis of riverine biota (macroinvertebrates and primary producers) and (5) the identification of the sources of suspended and settled sediments. The assessment revealed a gradient of spatially heterogeneous river bank erosion due to the degradation of the riparian vegetation caused by over-grazing and wood utilization. As the most prominent ecological response, the biomass of benthic algae decreased and macrozoobenthic community metrics changed continuously along the pressure gradient, accompanied by shifts of habitat related functional traits. At the same time, the hyporheic zone dimensions and functioning were affected by suspended and infiltrated sediments in multiple ways (restricted spatial extent, lowered hydraulic connectivity, lower metabolism, ecologically critical quality of pore water). Geochemical and radionuclide fallout isotope fingerprinting has identified riverbank erosion as the main source of the suspended sediments in the Kharaa River, when compared to gully and land surface erosion. Erosion susceptibility calculations in combination with suspended sediment observations showed a strong seasonal and annual variability of sediment input and instream transport, and a strong connection of erosional behaviour with land-use. Amongst others, the protection of headwaters and the stabilization of the river bank erosion hotspots in the midstream sections of the Kharaa River are the priority measures to avoid further degradation of the aquatic ecosystem status and functions.

AB The assumption that traits and phylogenies can be used as proxies of species niche has faced criticisms. Evidence suggested that phylogenic relatedness is a weak proxy of trait similarity. Moreover, different processes can select different traits, giving opposing signals in null model analyses. To circumvent these criticisms, we separated traits of stream insects based on the concept of alpha and beta niches, which should give clues about assembling pressures expected to act independently of each other. We investigated the congruence between the phylogenetic structure and trait structure of communities using all available traits and all possible combinations of traits (4095 combinations). To account for hierarchical assembling processes, we analyzed patterns on two spatial scales with three pools of genera. Beta niche traits selected a priori - i.e., traits related to environmental variation (e.g., respiration type) - were consistently clustered on the smaller scale, suggesting environmental filtering, while a niche traits i. e., traits related to resource use (e.g., trophic position) - did not display the expected overdispersion, suggesting a weak role of competition. Using all traits together provided random patterns and the analysis of all possible combinations of traits provided scenarios ranging from strong clustering to overdispersion. Communities were phylogenetically overdispersed, a pattern previously interpreted as phylogenetic limiting similarity. However, our results likely reflect the co-occurrence of ancient clades due to the stability of stream habitats along the evolutionary scale. We advise ecologists to avoid using combinations of all available traits but rather carefully traits based on the objective under consideration. Both trait and phylogenetic approaches should be kept in the ecologist toolbox, but phylogenetic distances should not be used as proxies of traits differences. Although the phylogenetic structure revealed processes operating at the evolutionary scale, only specific traits explained local processes operating in our communities.

AB The leaves of Tamarix aphylla, a globally distributed, salt-secreting desert tree, are dotted with alkaline droplets of high salinity. To successfully inhabit these organic carbon-rich droplets, bacteria need to be adapted to multiple stress factors, including high salinity, high alkalinity, high UV radiation, and periodic desiccation. To identify genes that are important for survival in this harsh habitat, microbial community DNA was extracted from the leaf surfaces of 10 Tamarix aphylla trees along a 350-km longitudinal gradient. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing, contig assembly, and binning yielded 17 genome bins, six of which were >80% complete. These genomic bins, representing three phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes), were closely related to halophilic and alkaliphilic taxa isolated from aquatic and soil environments. Comparison of these genomic bins to the genomes of their closest relatives revealed functional traits characteristic of bacterial populations inhabiting the Tamarix phyllosphere, independent of their taxonomic affiliation. These functions, most notably light-sensing genes, are postulated to represent important adaptations toward colonization of this habitat.
   IMPORTANCE
   Plant leaves are an extensive and diverse microbial habitat, forming the main interface between solar energy and the terrestrial biosphere. There are hundreds of thousands of plant species in the world, exhibiting a wide range of morphologies, leaf surface chemistries, and ecological ranges. In order to understand the core adaptations of microorganisms to this habitat, it is important to diversify the type of leaves that are studied. This study provides an analysis of the genomic content of the most abundant bacterial inhabitants of the globally distributed, salt-secreting desert tree Tamarix aphylla. Draft genomes of these bacteria were assembled, using the culture-independent technique of assembly and binning of metagenomic data. Analysis of the genomes reveals traits that are important for survival in this habitat, most notably, light-sensing and light utilization genes.

AB Dynamic interaction between river morphodynamics and vegetation affects river channel patterns and populations of riparian species. A range of numerical models exists to investigate the interaction between vegetation and morphodynamics. However, many of these models oversimplify either the morphodynamics or the vegetation dynamics, which hampers the development of predictive models for river management. We have developed a model coupling advanced morphodynamics and dynamic vegetation, which is innovative because it includes dynamic ecological processes and progressing vegetation characteristics as opposed to commonly used static vegetation without growth and mortality. Our objective is to understand and quantify the effects of vegetation-type dependent settling, growth and mortality on the river pattern and morphodynamics of a meandering river. We compared several dynamic vegetation scenarios with different functional trait sets to reference scenarios without vegetation and with static vegetation without growth and mortality. We find distinct differences in morphodynamics and river morphology. The default dynamic vegetation scenario, based on two Salicaceae species, shows an active meandering behaviour, while the static vegetation scenario develops into a static, vegetation-dominated state. The diverse vegetation patterns in the dynamic scenario reduce lateral migration, increase meander migration rate and create a smoother floodplain compared to the static scenario. Dynamic vegetation results in typical vegetation patterns, vegetation age distribution and river patterns as observed in the field. We show a quantitative interaction between vegetation and morphodynamics, where increasing vegetation cover decreases sediment transport rates. Furthermore, differences in vegetation colonization, density and survival create distinct patterns in river morphology, showing that vegetation properties and dynamics drive the formation of different river morphologies. Our model demonstrates the high sensitivity of channel morphodynamics to various species traits, an understanding which is required for floodplain and stream restoration and more realistic modelling of long-term river development.

AB The adaptation of bacterial lineages to local environmental conditions creates the potential for broader genotypic diversity within a species, which can enable a species to dominate across ecological gradients because of niche flexibility. The genus Polynucleobacter maintains both free-living and symbiotic ecotypes and maintains an apparently ubiquitous distribution in freshwater ecosystems. Subspecieslevel resolution supplemented with metagenome-derived genotype analysis revealed that differential functional constraints, not geographic distance, produce and maintain strain-level genetic conservation in Polynucleobacter populations across three geographically proximal riverine environments. Genes associated with cofactor biosynthesis and one-carbon metabolism showed habitat specificity, and protein-coding genes of unknown function and membrane transport proteins were under positive selection across each habitat. Characterized by different median ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous evolutionary changes (dN/dS ratios) and a limited but statistically significant negative correlation between the dN/dS ratio and codon usage bias between habitats, the free-living and core genotypes were observed to be evolving under strong purifying selection pressure. Highlighting the potential role of genetic adaptation to the local environment, the two-component system protein-coding genes were highly stable (dN/dS ratio, < 0.03). These results suggest that despite the impact of the habitat on genetic diversity, and hence niche partition, strong environmental selection pressure maintains a conserved core genome for Polynucleobacter populations.
   IMPORTANCE Understanding the biological factors influencing habitat-wide genetic endemism is important for explaining observed biogeographic patterns. Polynucleobacter is a genus of bacteria that seems to have found a way to colonize myriad freshwater ecosystems and by doing so has become one of the most abundant bacteria in these environments. We sequenced metagenomes from locations across the Chicago River system and assembled Polynucleobacter genomes from different sites and compared how the nucleotide composition, gene codon usage, and the ratio of synonymous (codes for the same amino acid) to nonsynonymous (codes for a different amino acid) mutations varied across these population genomes at each site. The environmental pressures at each site drove purifying selection for functional traits that maintained a streamlined core genome across the Chicago River Polynucleobacter population while allowing for site-specific genomic adaptation. These adaptations enable Polynucleobacter to become dominant across different riverine environmental gradients.

AB Fine sediment inputs can alter estuarine ecosystem structure and function. However, natural variations in the processes that regulate sediment transport make it difficult to predict their fate. In this study, sediments were sampled at different times (2011-2012) from 45 points across intertidal sandflat transects in three New Zealand estuaries (Whitford, Whangamata, and Kawhia) encompassing a wide range in mud (<= 63 mu m) content (0-56 %) and macrofaunal community structure. Using a core-based erosion measurement device (EROMES), we calculated three distinct measures of sediment erosion potential: erosion threshold (AE (R) (c) ; N m(-2)), erosion rate (ER; g m(-2) s(-1)), and change in erosion rate with increasing bed shear stress (m (e) ; g N-1 s(-1)). Collectively, these measures characterized surface (AE (R) (c) and ER) and sub-surface (m (e) ) erosion. Benthic macrofauna were grouped by functional traits (size and motility) and data pooled across estuaries to determine relationships between abiotic (mud content, mean grain size) and biotic (benthic macrofauna, microbial biomass) variables and erosion measures. Results indicated that small bioturbating macrofauna (predominantly freely motile species < 5 mm in size) destabilized surface sediments, explaining 23 % of the variation in AE (R) (c) (p <= 0.01) and 59 % of the variation in ER (p <= 0.01). Alternatively, mud content and mean grain size cumulatively explained 61 % of the variation in m (e) (p <= 0.01), where increasing mud and grain size stabilized sub-surface sediments. These results highlight that the importance of biotic and abiotic predictors vary with erosion stage and that functional group classifications are a useful way to determine the impact of benthic macrofauna on sediment erodibility across communities with different species composition.

AB Plant litter breakdown is a key ecological process in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Streams and rivers, in particular, contribute substantially to global carbon fluxes. However, there is little information available on the relative roles of different drivers of plant litter breakdown in fresh waters, particularly at large scales. We present a global-scale study of litter breakdown in streams to compare the roles of biotic, climatic and other environmental factors on breakdown rates. We conducted an experiment in 24 streams encompassing latitudes from 47.88 degrees N to 42.88 degrees S, using litter mixtures of local species differing in quality and phylogenetic diversity (PD), and alder (Alnus glutinosa) to control for variation in litter traits. Our models revealed that breakdown of alder was driven by climate, with some influence of pH, whereas variation in breakdown of litter mixtures was explained mainly by litter quality and PD. Effects of litter quality and PD and stream pH were more positive at higher temperatures, indicating that different mechanisms may operate at different latitudes. These results reflect global variability caused by multiple factors, but unexplained variance points to the need for expanded global-scale comparisons.

AB The ability of species to maintain ecosystem functions under environmental stress depends on their vulnerability, adaptability and potential for dispersal and re-establishment. Species that share traits can perform similar functions, thus offering functional redundancy, and therefore potentially confer resilience in ecosystem function. In this regard, both species abundance and occurrence across a landscape are likely to affect the importance of redundancy. To investigate spatial patterns in functional redundancy, we assessed the degree to which specific functional traits linked to ecosystem function are shared, along with patterns of abundance and distribution, in a macrobenthic community (115 taxa; 23 682 individuals) sampled in 400 plots from a large intertidal area (300 000 m(2)). We defined 26 functional groups; 85% of these contained more than 1 species and 50% more than 3 species. Most functional group (22 of 26) distributions were non-random (as identified by Moran's I) and fell into 1 of 3 spatial patterns-gradients (n = 8 function groups), and large (n = 2) and small patches (n = 12)-that separate the functional attributes of the macrobenthic community. Only 2 functional groups exhibited low species richness and low abundance, but their widespread occurrence could provide resilience to small-scale disturbances. This spatial consideration of functional group distribution stresses the notion that resilience is likely to be scale-dependent rather than a commodity on offer across a whole system. Our findings emphasise the importance not only of within-functional group species richness but also of abundance and occurrence as a framework to investigate functional diversity and resilience of benthic seafloor communities.

AB Changes in the coral reef complex can affect predator-prey relationships, resource availability and niche utilisation in the associated fish community, which may be reflected in decreased stability of the functional traits present in a community. This is because particular traits may be favoured by a changing environment, or by habitat degradation. Furthermore, other traits can be selected against because degradation can relax the association between fishes and benthic habitat. We characterised six important ecological traits for fish species occurring at seven sites across a disturbed coral reef archipelago in Indonesia, where reefs have been exposed to eutrophication and destructive fishing practices for decades. Functional diversity was assessed using two complementary indices (FRic and RaoQ) and correlated to important environmental factors (live coral cover and rugosity, representing local reef health, and distance from shore, representing a cross-shelf environmental gradient). Indices were examined for both a change in their mean, as well as temporal (short-term; hours) and spatial (cross-shelf) variability, to assess whether fish-habitat association became relaxed along with habitat degradation. Furthermore, variability in individual traits was examined to identify the traits that are most affected by habitat change. Increases in the general reef health indicators, live coral cover and rugosity (correlated with distance from the mainland), were associated with decreases in the variability of functional diversity and with community-level changes in the abundance of several traits (notably home range size, maximum length, microalgae, detritus and small invertebrate feeding and reproductive turnover). A decrease in coral cover increased variability of RaoQ while rugosity and distance both inversely affected variability of FRic; however, averages for these indices did not reveal patterns associated with the environment. These results suggest that increased degradation of coral reefs is associated with increased variability in fish community functional composition resulting from selective impacts on specific traits, thereby affecting the functional response of these communities to increasing perturbations.

AB Stream metacommunities are structured by a combination of local (environmental filtering) and regional (dispersal) processes. The unique characters of high mountain streams could potentially determine metacommunity structuring, which is currently poorly understood. Aiming at understanding how these characters influenced metacommunity structuring, we explored the relative importance of local environmental conditions and various dispersal processes, including through geographical (overland), topographical (across mountain barriers) and network (along flow direction) pathways in shaping benthic diatom communities. From a trait perspective, diatoms were categorized into high-profile, low-profile and motile guild to examine the roles of functional traits. Our results indicated that both environmental filtering and dispersal processes influenced metacommunity structuring, with dispersal contributing more than environmental processes. Among the three pathways, stream corridors were primary pathway. Deconstructive analysis suggested different responses to environmental and spatial factors for each of three ecological guilds. However, regardless of traits, dispersal among streams was limited by mountain barriers, while dispersal along stream was promoted by rushing flow in high mountain stream. Our results highlighted that directional processes had prevailing effects on metacommunity structuring in high mountain streams. Flow directionality, mountain barriers and ecological guilds contributed to a better understanding of the roles that mountains played in structuring metacommunity.

AB Abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) is one of the most valuable marine aquatic species in Korea, Japan and China. Tremendous exposure to bacterial infection is common in aquaculture environment, especially by Vibrio sp. infections. It's therefore necessary and urgent to understand the mechanism of H. discus hannai host defense against Vibrio parahemolyticus infection. However studies on its immune system are hindered by the lack of genomic resources. In the present study, we sequenced the transcriptome of control and bacterial challenged H. discus hannai tissues. Totally, 138 MB of reference transcriptome were obtained from de novo assembly of 34 GB clean bases from ten different libraries and annotated with the biological terms (GO and KEGG). A total of 10,575 transcripts exhibiting the differentially expression at least one pair of comparison and the functional annotations highlight genes related to immune response, cell adhesion, immune regulators, redox molecules and mitochondrial coding genes. Mostly, these groups of genes were dominated in hemocytes compared to other tissues. This work is a prerequisite for the identification of those physiological traits controlling H. discus hannai ability to survive against Vibrio infection.

AB While the effects of coastal disposal of dredged material on benthic assemblage structure have been well studied, our understanding of the mechanism of such responses, and their potential ecological implications, remain relatively unknown. Data from a licenced disposal site off the northeast coast of England are analysed to address this and improve our ability to make informed licencing decisions for this activity. Assemblages within the disposal site displayed reduced number of species and total invertebrate density, an altered assemblage taxonomic structure, and a shift towards a greater numerical dominance of less-productive individuals. Following separate analyses of biological response and effect traits, a novel approach for marine benthic trait analysis, we identify the traits responsible (i.e. response traits) for the observed structural alterations. Furthermore, analysis of the effect traits revealed that the assemblages characterising the disposal site possess a greater bioturbative capability compared to those not directly impacted by disposal.

AB Recent climate variability and anomaly in the Great Lakes region provided a valuable opportunity in examining the response and regulation of ecosystem carbon cycling across different ecosystems. A simple Bayesian hierarchical model was developed and fitted against three-year (2011-2013) net ecosystem CO2 exchange (F-co2) data observed at three eddy-covariance sites (i.e., a deciduous woodland, a cropland, and a marsh) in northwestern Ohio. The model was designed to partition the variation of gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and F-co2, that resulted directly from the shortterm environmental forcing (i.e., direct effect) and indirectly from the changes of ecosystem functional traits (e.g., structural, physiological, and phenological traits) (i.e., indirect effect). Interannual variation of F-co2 was mainly driven by indirect effects, accounting for 54%, 89%, and 86% of the interannual variation at the woodland, cropland, and marsh sites, respectively. On the other hand, direct climatic effects accounted for 33% of interannual F-co2 variation at the woodland site and became irrelevant (<10%) at the cropland and marsh sites. In general, annual GEP and ER at each site tended to co-vary and dampen the interannual variability in F-co2. Yet, year-to-year changes of GEP and ER were not spatially synchronous, suggesting that the ecosystem's response to climate was strongly site-specific in terms of the annual net CO2 uptake. Future research should focus on the disparate response among ecosystems and develop a suitable framework to examine the mechanisms that drive differences in closely co-located ecosystems.

AB There is growing evidence that species are able to coexist in communities through niche separation, and that consistent community structuring can take place at the biogeographical scale, as the same biotic interactions can determine species' fate at large scales. In this study, we document niche differentiation at a larger scale within a specific plant community of softwater lakes in Western Europe. Five species were selected for their relative frequency and wide geographical distribution within the dataset that we collected. Their niches were modelled both from presence-absence data and from ordinal abundance data, using mixed regression techniques (generalized linear mixed models and proportional odds mixed models, respectively). The modelled realized niches differed among the species on the West-European scale, although strict separation was not shown and geographical coverage is not complete. Plant strategy characterization of the species supported the assumption that functional traits underpin the niche differentiation among the species through fitness trade-offs. Mechanistic experimental research at a range of spatial scales is needed to test the importance of different community structuring mechanisms at the biogeographical scale, such as biotic interactions and environmental filtering.

AB Under the ecosystem approach to fisheries, an optimal fishing pattern is one that gives the highest possible yield while having the least structural impact on the community. Unregulated, open -access African inland fisheries have been observed to sustain high catches by harvesting a broad spectrum of species and sizes, often in conflict with current management regulations in terms of mesh and gear regulations. Using a size- and trait-based model, we explore whether such exploitation patterns are commensurable with the ecosystem approach to fisheries by comparing the impacts on size spectrum slope and yield with the different size limit regimes employed in the Zambian and Zimbabwean sides of man-made Lake Kariba. Long-term multispecies data under fished and unfislied conditions are used to compare and validate the model results. Both model and observations show that the highest yields and low structural impact on the ecosystem are obtained by targeting small individuals in the community. These results call for a re-evaluation of the size -based management regulations that are ubiquitous in most fisheries.

AB The causes of fish community organization in a system of habitat patches with different environmental conditions were described using a data set of 65 sites sampled during the dry season. Incorporating the patchy heterogeneous structure, variation partitioning allowed us to specifically evaluate the fine-scale neutral processes produced by spatial autocorrelation within habitat patches, and the broad-scale dispersal limitations between patches. Only the second subset of spatial variables was significant; dispersal limitation was relatively low between habitat patches of varzea lakes. An analysis of functional ecology allowed an empirical description of the functional mechanisms of alpha and beta niche differentiation, and an assessment of the phylogenetic signal. The trait-convergence assembly pattern among habitat patches indicated that fish in turbid river channels were better adapted to low light than fish in transparent black and clear water bodies. Also, fish in varzea lakes had a wider ecological range; this association indicated phylogenetic niche conservatism. The trait-divergence assembly pattern was almost expressed by body weight and was prominent in varzea lakes; combined with ecological range and sensory adaptation, this association indicated a marginal phylogenetic signal. These results suggest the radiation of species-rich clades with a high degree of sensory adaptation may have occurred in the seasonal environment of varzea lakes. This resulted in larger ecological distribution and innovative life histories tightly synchronized with periodic flooding. The lineage-specific sensory adaptation and subsequent landscape and evolutional history of habitat specialization were also found to actually contribute to the fish metacommunity dynamic in the Bolivian Amazonian lowland.

AB Despite their homogeneous appearance, aquatic systems harbour heterogeneous habitats resulting from nutrient gradients, suspended particulate matter and stratification. Recent reports suggest phylogenetically conserved habitat preferences among bacterioplankton, particularly for particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) habitats. Here, we show that independent of lake nutrient level and layer, PA and FL abundance-weighted bacterial community composition (BCC) differed and that inter-lake BCC varied more for PA than for FL fractions. In low-nutrient lakes, BCC differences between PA and FL fractions were larger than those between lake layers. The reverse was true for high-nutrient lakes. Nutrient level affected BCC more in hypolimnia than in epilimnia, likely due to hypolimnetic hypoxia in high-nutrient lakes. In line with previous reports, we observed within-phylum operational taxonomic unit (OTU) habitat preference conservation, although not for all phyla, including the phylum with the highest average relative abundance across all habitats (Bacteroidetes). Consistent phylum-level habitat preferences may indicate that the functional traits that underpin ecological adaptation of freshwater bacteria to lake habitats can be phylogenetically conserved, although the levels of conservation are phylum dependent. Resolving taxa preferences for freshwater habitats sets the stage for identification of traits that underpin habitat specialization and associated functional traits that influence differences in biogeochemical cycling across freshwater lake habitats.

AB Aims
   Biodiversity-ecosystem function experiments can test for causal relationships between planting diversity and community productivity. Planting diversity is routinely introduced as a design element in created wetlands, yet substantive support for the finding that early diversity positively affects ecosystem functioning is lacking for wetlands. We conducted a 2-year diversity-productivity experiment using freshwater wetland mesocosms to investigate community biomass production as affected by planted macrophyte functional richness.
   Methods
   A richness gradient of macrophytes in four emergent wetland plant functional groups was established in freshwater mesocosms for two consecutive years. Species-specific aboveground morphological traits of plant size were measured at peak growth in both years; rooting depth was measured for each species in the second year. Aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) were harvested after peak growth in the second year; first year AGB was estimated from morphological traits in constructed regression equations. Net richness effects (i.e. both complementarity effects and selection effects) were calculated using an additive partitioning method.
   Important Findings
   Species richness had a positive effect on community AGB relative to monocultures in the first year. In the second year, mean AGB was significantly reduced by competition in the most species-rich mixtures and all mixtures underyielded relative to the average monoculture. Competition for soil resources was weaker belowground, whereby root distribution at depths > 20 cm was reduced at the highest richness levels but overall BGB production was not affected. Changes in species biomass were strongly reflected by variation in species morphological traits, and species above and belowground performances were highly correlated. The obligate annual (Eleocharis obtusa), a dominant competitor, significantly contributed to the depression of perennial species' growth in the second growing season. To foster primary productivity with macrophyte richness in early successional communities of created wetlands where ruderal strategies are favored and competition may be stronger than species complementarity, unsystematic planting designs such as clustering the same or similar species could provide protection for some individuals. Additionally, engineering design elements fostering spatial or temporal environmental variability (e. g. microtopography) in newly created wetlands helps diversify the responses of wetland macrophyte species to their environment and could allow for greater complementarity in biomass production.

AB The use of functional traits to characterize community composition has been proposed as a more effective way to link community structure to ecosystem functioning. Organismal morphology, body stoichiometry, and physiology can be readily linked to large scale ecosystem processes through functional traits that inform on interspecific and species environment interactions; yet such effect traits are still poorly included in trait based approaches. Given their key trophic position in aquatic ecosystems, individual zooplankton affect energy fluxes and elemental processing. We compiled a large database of zooplankton traits contributing to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling and examined the effect of classification and habitat (marine vs. freshwater) on trait relationships. Respiration and nutrient excretion rates followed mass dependent scaling in both habitats, with exponents ranging from 0.70 to 0.90. Our analyses revealed surprising differences in allometry and respiration between habitats, with freshwater species having lower length-specific mass and three times higher mass specific respiration rates. These differences in traits point to implications for ecological strategies as well as overall carbon storage and fluxes based on habitat type. Our synthesis quantifies multiple trait relationships and links organisms to ecosystem processes they influence, enabling a more complete integration of aquatic community ecology and biogeochemistry through the promising use of effect traits.

AB Although the need to prioritize limited conservation resources has prompted increased interest in understanding the functional importance of species within ecosystems, species that are infrequently observed are often written off as being unimportant. In this study, we use aquatic snakes as a case study for examining the importance of secretive predators. Most snakes are extremely cryptic and secretive, traits that not only lead to the perception that they are rare, and of minor importance, but also impede attempts to quantify densities. We used high sampling effort and robust-design capture-recapture analyses to estimate density of aquatic snakes inhabiting an isolated 5.4-ha wetland in South Carolina, USA. We assessed snake diets and coupled field measurements of growth rates with laboratory-derived data on mass conversion efficiency to estimate prey consumption by snakes over a 1-year period. We found a peak density 171 snakes ha(-1) of wetland habitat, corresponding to a standing biomass of 7.77kgha(-1). We calculated that snakes within the wetland consumed a total of over 200kg (>55000 individuals) of amphibian prey annually, translating into >150000kJha(-1) of energy flow from secondary to tertiary consumers within the wetland food web. Further, because many amphibians are primarily terrestrial as adults and are consumed by aquatic snakes only when they return to wetlands to breed, snakes can be responsible for substantial transfer of energy and biomass between terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Our study is one of the first comprehensive evaluations of the importance of snakes as predators and underscores the need to consider snakes in initiatives aimed at preserving overall ecosystem integrity.

AB Managing ecosystems to maintain biodiversity may be one approach to ensuring their dynamic stability, productivity, and delivery of vital services. The applicability of this approach to industrial ecosystems that harness the metabolic activities of microbes has been proposed but has never been tested at relevant scales. We used a tag-sequencing approach with bacterial small subunit rRNA (16S) genes and eukaryotic internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) to measuring the taxonomic composition and diversity of bacteria and eukaryotes in an open pond managed for bioenergy production by microalgae over a year. Periods of high eukaryotic diversity were associated with high and more-stable biomass productivity. In addition, bacterial diversity and eukaryotic diversity were inversely correlated over time, possibly due to their opposite responses to temperature. The results indicate that maintaining diverse communities may be essential to engineering stable and productive bioenergy ecosystems using microorganisms.

AB Chemical contamination has impaired ecosystems, reducing biodiversity and the provisioning of functions and services. This has spurred a movement to restore contaminated ecosystems and develop and implement national and international regulations that require it. Nevertheless, ecological restoration remains a young and rapidly growing discipline and its intersection with toxicology is even more nascent and underdeveloped. Consequently, we provide guidance to scientists and practitioners on when, where, and how to restore contaminated ecosystems. Although restoration has many benefits, it also can be expensive, and in many cases systems can recover without human intervention. Hence, the first question we address is: When should we restore contaminated ecosystems? Second, we provide suggestions on what to restorebiodiversity, functions, services, all 3, or something elseand where to restore given expected changes to habitats driven by global climate change. Finally, we provide guidance on how to restore contaminated ecosystems. To do this, we analyze critical aspects of the literature dealing with the ecology of restoring contaminated ecosystems. Additionally, we review approaches for translating the science of restoration to on-the-ground actions, which includes discussions of market incentives and the finances of restoration, stakeholder outreach and governance models for ecosystem restoration, and working with contractors to implement restoration plans. By explicitly considering the mechanisms and strategies that maximize the success of the restoration of contaminated sites, we hope that our synthesis serves to increase and improve collaborations between restoration ecologists and ecotoxicologists and set a roadmap for the restoration of contaminated ecosystems.

AB The upstream-downstream gradient (UDG) is a key feature of streams. For instance food webs are assumed to change from upstream to downstream. We tested this hypothesis in a small European river catchment (937 km(2)), and examined whether food web modifications are related to structural (i.e. food web composition) or functional changes (i.e. alteration of linkages within the web). We adopted a double approach at two levels of organisation (assemblage and species levels) using two isotopic metrics (isotopic space area and isotopic niche overlap), and proposed a new hypothesis-testing framework for exploring the dominant feeding strategy within a food web. We confirmed that the UDG influenced stream food webs, and found that food web modifications were related to both structural and functional changes. The structural change was mainly related to an increase in species richness, and induced functional modifications of the web (indirect effect). In addition, the UDG also modified the functional features of the web directly, without changing the web composition. The proposed framework allowed relating the direct effect of the UDG to a diet specialisation of the species, and the indirect effect via the structural changes to a generalist feeding strategy. The framework highlights the benefits of conducting the double approach, and provides a foundation for future studies investigating the dominant feeding strategy that underlies food web modifications.

AB Intermittent rivers are naturally dynamic ecosystems in which flow cessation and riverbed drying cause temporal fluctuations in aquatic biodiversity. We analysed datasets from intermittent rivers in different climate zones across the world to examine responses of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages to drying, in relation to both taxonomic composition and traits of resistance and resilience. First, we compared the differences in taxonomic richness and turnover and in trait diversity, richness and redundancy before and after intermittent sites dried with the differences in concurrently sampled perennial sites. We found such high levels of variation in the before-after differences at intermittent and perennial sites that we could not detect statistical differences between them. Second, we examined the effects of climate (arid, Mediterranean, temperate) and durations of dry and post-dry (flowing) periods on responses to drying at intermittent sites. Only climate had a detectable effect; the proportion of taxa at intermittent sites that persisted through drying-rewetting phases was greatest in arid-zone rivers. Regardless of climate, the invertebrates that persisted at intermittent sites were dominated by taxa resistant to drying. By contrast, taxa that persisted at perennial sites had fewer traits conferring resistance but more conferring resilience. The contributions of resistance and resilience combined with the presence of both intermittent and perennial reaches likely supports the long-term stability and persistence of communities in intermittent rivers, despite the inherently high variation in short-term responses to drying.

AB Batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea) are a diverse group of cartilaginous fishes which comprise a monophyletic sister lineage to all neoselachians or modern sharks. All species in this group possess anteroposteriorly expanded-pectoral fins, giving them a unique disc-like body form. Reliance on pectoral fins for propulsion ranges from minimal (sawfish) to almost complete dependence (skates and rays). A recent study on the diversity of planform pectoral fin shape in batoids compared overall patterns of morphological variation within the group. However, inconsistent pectoral homology prevented the study from accurately representing relationships within and among major batoid taxa. With previous work in mind, we undertook an independent investigation of pectoral form in batoids and evaluated the implications of shape diversity on locomotion and lifestyle, particularly in the skates (Rajoidei) and rays (Myliobatoidei). We used geometric morphometrics with sliding semilandmarks to analyze pectoral fin outlines and also calculate fin aspect ratios (AR), a functional trait linked to locomotion. In agreement with previous work, our results indicated that much of the evolution of batoid pectoral shape has occurred along a morphological axis that is closely related to AR. For species where kinematic data were available, both shape and AR were associated with swimming mode. This work further revealed novel patterns of shape variation among batoids, including strong bimodality of shape in rays, an intermediate location of skate species in the morphospace between benthic/demersal and pelagic rays, and approximately parallel shape trajectories in the benthic/demersal rays and skates. Finally, manipulation of landmarks verified the need for a consistent and accurate definition of homology for the outcome and efficacy of analyses of pectoral form and function in batoids. J.

AB The Mediterranean Sea hosts hundreds of offshore gas platforms, whose activity represents a potential threat to marine ecosystems. Evidence from several studies indicates that nematodes can be highly sensitive to changes in the environmental quality. Here, we investigated the response of nematode assemblages to the presence of offshore gas platforms (located in the central Mediterranean Sea) in terms of spatial heterogeneity, structural and functional diversity. Since the effect of the investigated offshore platforms on macrofaunal assemblages were previously assessed by Terlizzi et al. (2008), the study provided also the opportunity to compare the response of different benthic compartments to the same impact related to fossil fuel extraction on marine environments. The platforms had a significant impact on nematode assemblages up to 1000 m distance from the structure. The effects were evident in term of: a) more homogeneous spatial distribution of nematode assemblages, b) increased trophic diversity of deposit feeders and c) changes in life strategies with an increase of opportunistic species in sediments closer to the platforms. Such effects seemed to be related to the dimension of the platform structures, rather than to chemical pollution or changes in food availability. These findings suggest that the platforms exert a physical alteration of the surrounding environment that is reflected by altered structural and functional traits of nematode biodiversity. The use of nematodes for monitoring the effects of the platforms only partially matched with the results obtained using macrofauna, providing further insights on potential outcomes on the functional response of marine assemblages to fossil fuel extraction.

AB Stream ecology studies see to understand ecological dynamics in lotic systems. The characterization of streams into Functional Process Zones (FPZ) has been currently debated in stream ecology because aquatic communities respond to functional processes of river segments. Therefore, we tested if different functional process zones have different number of genera and trophic structure using the aquatic insect community of Neotropical streams. We also assessed whether using physical and chemical variables may complement the approach of using FPZ to model communities of aquatic insects in Cerrado streams. This study was conducted in 101 streams or rivers from the central region of the state of Goias, Brazil. We grouped the streams into six FPZ associated to size of the river system, presence of riparian forest, and riverbed heterogeneity. We used Bayesian models to compare number of genera and relative frequency of the feeding groups between FPZs. Streams classified in different FPZs had a different number of genera, and the largest and best preserved rivers had an average of four additional genera. Trophic structure exhibited low variability among FPZs, with little difference both in the number of genera and in abundance. Using functional process zones in Cerrado streams yielded good results for Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera communities. Thus, species distribution and community structure in the river basin account for functional processes and not necessarily for the position of the community along a longitudinal dimension of the lotic system.

AB Despite the large number of river restoration projects carried out worldwide, evidence for strong and long-term positive ecological effects of hydromorphological restoration on macroinvertebrates is scarce. To improve the understanding of the success and failure of restoration measures, a standardized field study was carried out in nineteen paired restored and degraded river sections in mid-sized lowland and mountain rivers throughout Europe. We investigated if there were effects of restoration on macroinvertebrate biodiversity, and if these effects could be related to changes in microhabitat composition, diversity and patchiness. Effects were quantified for all taxa combined, as well as Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera separately. Additionally, species trait classifications of microhabitat preference types were used as a functional indicator. Restoration had no overall positive effects on the selected macroinvertebrate metrics. Rather, we did find positive relationships between the macroinvertebrate responses and the effect of restoration on the diversity and patchiness of microhabitats. Furthermore, the effects on macroinvertebrates could be related to changes in the cover of specific substrate types in the restored sections. We conclude that the limited effect of restoration on macroinvertebrate diversity overall reflected, at least in part, the limited effect of most restoration measures on microhabitat composition and diversity.

AB Most river restoration projects have applied relatively small-scale measures focused on improving specific instream conditions, with only limited outcomes for biodiversity in rivers and their adjacent riparian habitats. Here, we investigate the effects of both small- and large-scale restoration projects on floodplain vegetation across 20 European catchments. We focused on the roles of different restoration parameters (i.e., the number, spatial extent and type of restoration measure applied and restoration age) and specific environmental characteristics in regulating changes in plant diversity and trait composition following restoration. Among restoration characteristics, restoration type was the only significant determinant of plant community responses, with stream channel widening having the strongest effects, particularly on the diversity and composition of species traits favoured by increases in physical disturbance (e.g. flooding) and open habitat patch availability (e.g. plant growth form, life strategy and life span). Of the environmental variables, altitude and discharge were positively and most strongly related to responses of both species and trait diversity. Our results emphasise the value of (i) choosing relevant restoration measures that affect environmental conditions of importance for the target organism group and (ii) conducting restoration projects in environmental settings where the likelihood of restoration "success" is maximised.

AB It has long been hypothesised that there is a functional correlation between brain size and metabolic rate in vertebrates. The present study tested this hypothesis in wild-caught adult mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki by testing for an intra-specific association between resting metabolic rate (RMR) and brain size while controlling for variation in body size, and through the examination of the effects of spatial enrichment and laboratory housing on body mass-independent measures of brain size and RMR. Controlling for body mass, there was no relationship between brain size and RMR in wild-caught fish. Contrary to predictions, spatial enrichment caused a decrease in mass-independent brain size, highlighting phenotypic plasticity in the adult brain. As expected, after controlling for differences in body size, wild-caught fish had relatively larger brains than fish that had been maintained in the laboratory for a minimum of six weeks, but wild-caught fish also had significantly lower mass-independent RMR. This study demonstrates that an organisms' housing environment can cause significant plastic changes to fitness related traits including brain size and RMR. We therefore conclude that current standard laboratory housing conditions may cause captive animals to be non-representative of their wild counterparts, potentially undermining the transferability of previous laboratorybased studies of aquatic ectothermic vertebrates to wild populations.

AB Range expansion by invasive taxa can be facilitated by a wide variety of life history traits, by behavioral repertoires, or via human-aided translocation. The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) continues to expand its range in Europe and the Great Lakes watershed by moving upstream in tributary rivers and streams. It is not clear whether in-stream barriers (e.g., waterfalls, culverts, dams) will prevent further upstream expansion. Since other species within the Gobiidae are adept waterfall climbers, we investigated whether body scaling morphometrics, fused pelvic fin adhesion, or swimming patterns in round gobies were suggestive of climbing capability. Behaviorally, round gobies swam less frequently, limited their swimming mode to caudal thrusts, and sought shelter more as velocity increased. Attachment to the substrate via the fused pelvic fins was documented in a laboratory flume. Fish smaller than 5 cm or having a body mass less than 1.5 g had passive pelvic fin adhesion power sufficient to remain in place on a wetted, inclined plane, whereas larger fish did not. Small fish had significantly smaller pelvic fin area/length ratios relative to larger fish (P < 0.001), but significantly greater pelvic fin area/mass ratios (P < 0.001). Caudal fin area, but not fused pelvic fin area, exhibited an allometric growth pattern versus weight in large gobies, whereas neither caudal nor pelvic fin area showed allometric increases versus weight in small round gobies. Pelvic fin area in both large and small fish grew allometrically compared to length, whereas caudal fin area increased allometrically relative to length only in small fish. Fin morphometric results suggest, theoretically, that neither adults nor juveniles have pelvic fin areas large enough to support their weight against gravity forces, but the areas are sufficient to withstand hydraulic drag forces. Collectively, our results suggest that in-stream barriers which force fish to overcome gravity should be impassable, but that barriers allowing fish to remain submerged could be navigable.

AB Hypoxia was a major challenge faced by cetaceans during the course of secondary aquatic adaptation. Although physiological traits of hypoxia tolerance in cetaceans have been well characterized, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. We investigated the sequences of 17 hypoxia-tolerance-related genes in representative cetaceans to provide a comprehensive insight into the genetic basis of hypoxia tolerance in these animals. Genes involved in carrying and transporting oxygen in the blood and muscle (hemoglobin-alpha and beta, myoglobin), and genes involved in the regulation of vasoconstriction (endothelin-1, -2, and -3; endothelin receptor type A and B; adrenergic receptor alpha-1D; and arginine vasopressin) appear to have undergone adaptive evolution, evidence for positive selection on their particular sites, and radical physiochemical property changes of selected condons. Interestingly, "long-diving" cetaceans had relatively higher omega (d(N)/d(S)) values than "short-diving" cetaceans for the hemoglobin beta gene, indicating divergent selective pressure presented in cetacean lineages with different diving abilities. Additionally, parallel positive selection or amino acid changes (ADRA1D: P50A, A53G, AVPR1B: I/V270T) among animals exposed to different hypoxia habitats reflect functional convergence or similar genetic mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance. In summary, positive selection, divergent selective pressures, and parallel evolution at the molecular level provided some new insights into the genetic adaptation of hypoxia tolerance.

AB Comprehensive research on the structural and functional variability of benthic macroinvertebrate communities within headwater streams is limited, despite the fact that the majority of streams within a watershed are headwater streams that form the primary link between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, we investigated the structure and function of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in four headwater streams at two different spatial scales (i.e., sampling sites (i.e., reaches) >samples (i.e., riffles)) over three seasons (i.e., spring, summer and autumn) of the year. Community indices, functional feeding guilds and habit trait guilds varied significantly depending on the seasons rather than on sites in two-way ANOVA based on spatial (i.e., sampling sites) and seasonal effects in each headwater stream. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses showed the differences between communities according to the considered spatial and temporal scales. At the individual stream scale, the differences between samples followed seasonal variation more than spatial differences. Site differences became more important when performing an ordination within a single season (i.e., spring, summer, and autumn). Continued research and monitoring employing both multidisciplinary and multidimensional approaches are required to maintain macroinvertebrate diversity within headwater streams.

AB The Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management claims that fisheries management should take into account the ecosystem processes; in that context, it is useful to examine the functional traits of fisheries assemblages. This can be a challenge in multispecies fisheries. We used 21 biological traits of 86 species to investigate the relationship between-species and trait composition and to identify species with rare functional traits. Combining these traits with two catch datasets from the eastern Mediterranean (Patraikos Gulf: small-scale fleet, eastern Ionian Sea: entire multispecies fleet), we investigated whether certain fishing tactics or gears tend to remove specific traits, using multivariate methodologies. Species and traits composition of the catches were related, but an important part of trait variability was not explained by species composition. Rare traits and trait combinations were found for important target or bycatch species. Differences in the traits composition of fishing operations were revealed both between fishing tactics (Patraikos) as well as gears and areas (eastern Ionian); hierarchical clustering and MDS indicated the distinction of purse-seine catches at gear level. SIMPER analysis by trait indicated associations of certain trait categories mainly with purse-seines (at gear level) and longline metiers and a trammel-net metier (at metier level). The identification of rare traits or their combinations can have significant management implications as overfishing of the species with these traits could result in altering assemblage functioning. It seems that the multispecies character of the benthic fisheries results in a balanced trait removal, while management should regulate the effects of purse-seine fisheries on the fisheries assemblage functioning. Further investigation of the functions that fishing may remove from the ecosystem could contribute to understanding the effects of fishing and reveal overlooked aspects useful for the improvement of fisheries management.

AB Neotropical, overseas regions of Europe are subjected to the same water policy objectives as the continental ones but were overlooked during recent developments of bioindicators that fulfil the Water Framework Directive guidelines. We designed a macroinvertebrate-based multimetric index [Indice Biotique Macroinvertebres de Guyane (IBMG)] to assess ecological health in remote headwater-small streams of French Guiana, Europe's only overseas region of continental South America. Invertebrates were sampled at 95 sites including reference and impacted river reaches, following a standardized protocol. Among the 102 biological metrics calculated from site-specific data, we selected metrics exhibiting the best trade-off between high discrimination efficiency, low specificity, low redundancy and high stability under reference conditions. The IBMG is composed of two taxonomic richness-based metrics, two abundance-based metrics, one trait-related metric and a diversity index (Shannon's entropy). Each metric was weighted by its discrimination efficiency. Using a test data set, we found that the IBMG was sensitive to the range of disturbances in French Guiana. Finally, comparing the IBMG with other indices developed in other neotropical countries reveals that, for several reasons, multimetric indices developed in the neotropics may perform well in the context of the data sets used to generate them but would certainly fail to be robust when used elsewhere.

AB In naturally disturbed systems, harsh environmental conditions act as filters on the regional species pool, restricting the number of taxa able to form a local community to those with traits promoting resistance or resilience. Thus, communities in highly disturbed ecosystems may be less sensitive to a given disturbance than those in less disturbed ecosystems. We explored this idea by examining the response of aquatic invertebrate communities to flow intermittence in gravel-bed, braided rivers (BRs). Flow intermittence is considered a major driver of communities in rivers, but its influence on communities in BRs, which are recognized as naturally highly disturbed environments, is relatively unexplored. We used a multisite Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design to quantify the effects of drying events of different durations (moderate: 2-3 wk, severe: 1-3 mo) on invertebrate communities in 8 BRs in southeastern France. As predicted, no effects of flow intermittence were detected 1 to 4 mo after flow resumption on taxonomic richness, composition, or functional diversity of communities facing moderate drying events. Communities subjected to severe drying events were similar to those in perennial reaches as few as 19 d after flow resumption. Moreover, communities showed functional redundancy and no loss of functional diversity after drying events. These results differ from those of studies in other river systems, where persistent effects of flow intermittence on communities generally have been found, and highlight the need for cross-system comparisons that explore the effects of drying on communities. Identifying the processes (e.g., niche selection, cotolerance) and habitat features (e.g., hyporheic zone refugia) that promote community resilience in BRs will advance our understanding of how anthropogenic stressors and climate change may affect communities in freshwater ecosystems.

AB Taxonomic diversity considers all species being equally different from each other and thus disregards species' different ecological functions. Exploring taxonomic and functional aspects of biodiversity simultaneously can better understand the processes of community assembly. We analysed taxonomic and functional alpha and beta diversities of breeding bird assemblages on land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. Given the high dispersal ability of most birds at this spatial scale (several kilometres), we predicted (i) selective extinction driving alpha and beta diversities after the creation of land-bridge islands of varying area and (ii) low taxonomic and functional beta diversities that were not correlated to spatial distance. Breeding birds were surveyed on 37 islands annually from 2007 to 2014. We decomposed beta diversity of breeding birds into spatial turnover and nestedness-resultant components, and related taxonomic and functional diversities to island area and isolation using power regression models (for alpha diversity) and multiple regression models on distance matrices (for beta diversity). We then ran simulations to assess the strength of the correlations between taxonomic and functional diversities. Results revealed that both taxonomic and functional alpha diversities increased with island area. The taxonomic nestedness-resultant and turnover components increased and decreased with difference in area, respectively, but functional counterparts did not. Isolation played a minor role in explaining alpha- and beta-diversity patterns. By partitioning beta diversity, we found low levels of overall taxonomic and functional beta diversities. The functional nestedness-resultant component dominated overall functional beta diversity, whereas taxonomic turnover was the dominant component for taxonomic beta diversity. The simulation showed that functional alpha and beta diversities were significantly correlated with taxonomic diversities, and the observed values of correlations were significantly different from null expectations of random extinction. Our assessment of island bird assemblages validated the predictions of no distance effects and low beta diversity due to pervasive dispersal events among islands and also suggested that selective extinction drives taxonomic and functional alpha and beta diversities. The contrasting turnover and nestedness-resultant components of taxonomic and functional beta diversities demonstrate the importance of considering the multifaceted nature of biodiversity when examining community assembly.

AB AimOur aims were to compare the composition of testate amoeba (TA) communities from Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos Archipelago, which are likely in existence only as a result of anthropogenic habitat transformation, with similar naturally occurring communities from northern and southern continental peatlands. Additionally, we aimed at assessing the importance of niche-based and dispersal-based processes in determining community composition and taxonomic and functional diversity.
   LocationThe humid highlands of the central island of Santa Cruz, Galapagos Archipelago.
   MethodsWe survey the alpha, beta and gamma taxonomic and functional diversities of TA, and the changes in functional traits along a gradient of wet to dry habitats. We compare the TA community composition, abundance and frequency recorded in the insular peatlands with that recorded in continental peatlands of Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We use generalized linear models to determine how environmental conditions influence taxonomic and functional diversity as well as the mean values of functional traits within communities. We finally apply variance partitioning to assess the relative importance of niche- and dispersal-based processes in determining community composition.
   ResultsTA communities in Santa Cruz Island were different from their Northern Hemisphere and South American counterparts with most genera considered as characteristic for Northern Hemisphere and South American Sphagnum peatlands missing or very rare in the Galapagos. Functional traits were most correlated with elevation and site topography and alpha functional diversity to the type of material sampled and site topography. Community composition was more strongly correlated with spatial variables than with environmental ones.
   Main conclusionsTA communities of the Sphagnum peatlands of Santa Cruz Island and the mechanisms shaping these communities contrast with Northern Hemisphere and South American peatlands. Soil moisture was not a strong predictor of community composition most likely because rainfall and clouds provide sufficient moisture. Dispersal limitation was more important than environmental filtering because of the isolation of the insular peatlands from continental ones and the young ecological history of these ecosystems.

AB Aquatic ecosystems are fundamentally altered by nutrient enrichment, and effective monitoring tools are needed to detect biological responses especially in the early stages of eutrophication. We tested the utility of biological trait analysis (BTA) to quantify the temporal responses of nematodes inhabiting salt marsh creeks that were experimentally enriched with nutrients for 6 years. Feeding, body shape, and tail shape traits were characterized on >6000 nematodes from annual samples from enriched and non-enriched sites. Here, we ask if trait combinations are more effective than single traits in detecting the magnitude and rate of change. We also sought to identify combinations of traits that best distinguish natural from nutrient-induced variation. BTA revealed that feeding, body shape, and all traits combined equally detected the response to nutrient enrichment. Compared to single traits however, BTAs were more sensitive to temporal trends and better distinguished natural variation from the response to nutrient enrichment. Tail shape traits (that might respond to altered sediment texture or geochemistry) were not affected by enrichment, and feeding traits yielded the greatest difference between enriched and reference communities indicating that changes in food resources drove responses. Feeding traits provided the highest quality information content in our study, and the use of feeding traits alone may adequately identify anthropogenic effects in many studies. However, we caution that body shape, tail shape, and feeding traits were strongly interrelated at our study site, and a diversity of trait groups may increase the information content of BTAs in more diverse habitats.

AB The ecological role of an organism is a complex interaction between many factors, such as morphology, behaviour and physiology, which can act as functional constraints upon how an organism engages with the environment. We examined the ecological roles, guild structure and ecological convergence among 15 sympatric minnow species (Cyprinidae) in the New River (North Carolina, U.S.A.). Minnows often dominate fish species diversity and biomass in North American streams. We evaluated the ecological relationships among minnows using popular methods that correspond to different aspects of minnow biology: geometric morphometrics (landmark-based PCA), gut content analysis and stable isotopes (C-13, N-15, H-2). We then tested for clustering (i.e. guilds) and convergence among minnows using these traits. Important shape variation among species was primarily associated with mouth orientation and caudal peduncle morphology, implicating the importance of trophic and activity patterns. Minnows clustered into five guilds based on body shape. Gut contents revealed three discrete guilds: pelagic- and benthic-oriented invertivory and benthic herbivory. Stable isotopes revealed only two discrete guilds: algivory and invertivory; however, all minnows preferentially assimilated invertebrates. Minnows thus exhibit dynamic ecologies based largely on utilisation of the benthic-pelagic resource axis.

AB The introduction of exotic species has a major impact on a wide range of ecosystems, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Trichocorixa v. verticalis (Fieber, 1851), an euryhaline aquatic hemipteran native North America, has occurred as an exotic species in the Iberian Peninsula since at least 1997. In this study, we compared several physiological and biological traits (salinity tolerance of the different developmental stages, thermal tolerance, fecundity, and dispersal ability) in the alien species and three native, syntopic corixidae species (Sigara lateralis, Sigara scripta, and Sigara selecta), to determine which traits may explain its invasion success. Trichocorixa verticalis was the species most resistant to high conductivity at the egg stage, while S. selecta showed the highest halotolerance as adults. The invader had the highest upper thermal limit and a much higher fecundity than Sigara species. Wing morphometry suggested that T. verticalis may be a stronger flier than the native species. Our findings provide an example of how functional and ecological niche interactions among alien and native species can help predict impacts of invasion on aquatic communities.

AB Long-term phytoplankton dynamics in a floodplain lake, between periods of limnophase and potamophase was studied using the morphology-based functional classification (MBFG). The work was carried out to test the hypothesis that the temporal distribution of MBFGs is influenced by the hydrosedimentological regime of the Parana River, and that these differences can be registered by analyzing the dominant MBFGs in the two periods. Samples were taken in an isolated floodplain lake on the Upper Parana River floodplain, Brazil, from 2000 to 2012, and water level, water temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved-oxygen, euphotic zone, maximum depth, and nutrients were used to explain the distribution of MBFGs. 478 taxa were identified and distributed in seven MBFGs (I-VII). MBFG V (flagellates algae) and VI (diatoms) showed 100% frequency of occurrence. MBFG II was associated exclusively with the limnophase; MBFG IV and VII were associated with limnophase periods with higher pH and dissolved-oxygen content; and MBFG I, III, V, and VI were associated with limnophase and potamophase, mainly associated with transparency, nutrients, and conductivity. The MBFG approach represented the trends of each group in terms of its occurrence and biovolume, according to the hydrosedimentological regime, providing broad-scale information on changes in the phytoplankton.

AB Assessing zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton is crucial to understand, model, and predict the structure and dynamics of pelagic communities. Our hypothesis is that phytoplankton consumption by zooplankton in freshwater lakes can be well represented by clustering phytoplankton species into morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) and zooplankton species into broad taxonomic units: cladocerans, calanoid copepods, and rotifers. We characterized zooplankton potential grazing on MBFG based on an extensive literature review of experimental data including clearance and ingestion rates. Rotifers show greater potential grazing upon small-and medium-sized species (MBFG I and IV) and presented a Type III trait-based functional response. Cladocerans also show greater potential impact upon MBFG IV but a Type II response. Both groups maintained their respective feeding response regardless of the type of food available, indicating poor food selectivity. Copepods consumed different MBFGs, but a clear Type II pattern was observed when feeding on MBFGs V and VI. Prediction intervals indicated a greater variability in cladocerans' and copepods' response. This approach is a step to summarize and characterize grazing to the future quantification of ecosystem models. Further efforts should be done to include information about different larval stages and phytoplankton traits not directly related to morphology.

AB Analysis of ecosystem functioning is essential to describe the ecological status of ecosystems and is therefore directly requested in international directives. There is a lack of knowledge regarding functional aspects of benthic communities and their environmental and anthropogenic driving forces in the southern North Sea. This study linked functional composition of epibenthic communities to environmental conditions and fishing effort and investigated spatial correlations between habitat characteristics to gain insight into potential synergistic and/or cumulative effects. Functional composition of epifauna was assessed by using biological trait analysis (BTA), which considered 15 ecological traits of 54 species. Functional composition was related to ten predictor variables derived from sediment composition, bottom temperature and salinity, hydrodynamics, annual primary production and fishing effort. Our results revealed significantly different functional composition between the Dogger Bank, the Oyster Ground, the West and North Frisian coast. Mobility, feeding type, size and adult longevity were the most important traits differentiating the communities. A high proportion of trait modalities related to an opportunistic life mode were obvious in coastal areas especially at the West Frisian coast and in the area of the Frisian Front indicating disturbed communities. In contrast, functional composition in the Dogger Bank area indicated undisturbed communities with prevalence of large, long-lived and permanently attached species being sensitive towards disturbance such as fishing. Tidal stress, mud content of sediments, salinity, stratification and fishing effort were found to be the most important habitat characteristics shaping functional composition. Strong correlations were found between variables, especially between those which changed gradually from the coast to offshore areas including fishing effort. Unfavourable extremes of these factors in coastal areas resulted in disturbed epibenthic communities, while the relative influence of a single factor on functional composition cannot be quantified. Coastal communities seemed to be well adapted to disturbance and the prevalence of opportunistic trait modalities not necessarily revealed a poor ecological status according to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). The integration of functional aspects into the assessment of ecosystem health is recommended, since widely used structural measures failed in naturally disturbed habitats. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aim Impacts of non-native species have motivated development of risk assessment tools for identifying introduced species likely to become invasive. Here, we develop trait-based models for the establishment and impact stages of freshwater fish invasion, and use them to screen non-native species common in international trade. We also determine which species in the aquarium, biological supply, live bait, live food and water garden trades are likely to become invasive. Results are compared to historical patterns of non-native fish establishment to assess the relative importance over time of pathways in causing invasions.
   Location Laurentian Great Lakes region.
   Methods Trait-based classification trees for the establishment and impact stages of invasion were developed from data on freshwater fish species that established or failed to establish in the Great Lakes. Fishes in trade were determined from import data from Canadian and United States regulatory agencies, assigned to specific trades and screened through the developed models.
   Results Climate match between a species' native range and the Great Lakes region predicted establishment success with 75-81% accuracy. Trophic guild and fecundity predicted potential harmful impacts of established non-native fishes with 75-83% accuracy. Screening outcomes suggest the water garden trade poses the greatest risk of introducing new invasive species, followed by the live food and aquarium trades. Analysis of historical patterns of introduction pathways demonstrates the increasing importance of these trades relative to other pathways. Comparisons among trades reveal that model predictions parallel historical patterns; all fishes previously introduced from the water garden trade have established. The live bait, biological supply, aquarium and live food trades have also contributed established non-native fishes.
   Main conclusions Our models predict invasion risk of potential fish invaders to the Great Lakes region and could help managers prioritize efforts among species and pathways to minimize such risk. Similar approaches could be applied to other taxonomic groups and geographic regions.

AB The present study aims to compare the allometry and wood density of Goupia glabra Aubl. (Goupiaceae) in two different terra-firme sites in Amazonian forest. A total of 65 trees >= 10 cm DBH was sampled in both sites, with 39 trees in Nova Olinda do Norte (NOlinda, near the Amazon River) and 29 trees in Apui (near the southern edge of the Amazon forest). Except for the relationship between DBH (diameter at breast height) and H-t (total height), allometric relationships for G.glabra differed significantly between sites. Apui had lower intercept and greater slope for log(10) (DBH) versus log(10) (H-s - stem height), and, conversely, greater intercept and lower slope for log(10) (DBH) versus log(10) (C-h - crown height). The slope differed significantly between the sites for DBH versus C-d (crown diameter), with greater slope found for NOlinda. Mean basic wood density in Apui was 8.8% lower than in NOlinda. Our findings highlight the variation in adaptive strategy of G. glabra due to environmental differences between sites. This is probably because of different canopy-understory light gradients, which result in differentiation of resource allocation between vertical and horizontal growth, which, in turn, affects mechanical support related to wood density. We also hypothesize that differences in soil fertility and disturbance regimes between sites may act concomitantly with light.

A major component of this work has been to investigate functional linkages between the hydrogeomorphology and ecology of rivers. This special collection presents some of the outputs from this work concerning interactions between hydrological, geomorphological and ecological processes in naturally functioning river systems. Together, this set of five papers reviews some of the existing knowledge on interactions and feedbacks between hydrogeomorphology and ecology in river systems and outlines how hydrogeomorphological processes, ecological processes and plant traits contribute to driving river corridor dynamics that create and sustain a diversity of aquatic and wetland habitats that support fish communities.

AB Plants can slow water and trap sediment with their canopies and stabilise sediment with their roots. These influences are mediated by the characteristics or traits of the vegetation. Here, we review and investigate the flexibility, size, root form, clonal growth, perennation and Ellenberg F values of 459 European riverine species, considering their role in physical and ecological processes. We make use of existing plant trait datasets to create two typologies: one that identifies the role vegetation has in channel blockage (conveyance) and sediment accrual and a second typology, that indicates vegetation's ability to stabilize sediment. The two typologies are tools for interpreting botanical survey data collected using standard techniques across large numbers of sites as part of the European Union Water Framework Directive monitoring programmes. As such, they are designed to be used to indicate broad-scale patterns across sites rather than detailed insights into site-specific processes. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The Mediterranean damselfish Chromis chromis is a species with a broad distribution found both in the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic as far south as the coast of Angola. We hypothesized that the species may have significant functional morphological plasticity to adapt along a gradient of environmental conditions. It is a non-migratory zooplanktivorous species and spends the daytime searching for food in the middle of the water column. Therefore, local hydrodynamics could be one of the environmental factors affecting traits of C. chromis with repercussions at the population level. We compared the body condition, individual growth and body shapes of damselfish collected under two different hydrodynamic conditions (low similar to 10 cm s(-1) vs. high similar to 20 cm s(-1)). Specimens showed higher body condition under high-hydrodynamics, where conditions offered greater amounts of food, which were able to support larger individuals. Individuals smaller than 60-mm were more abundant under low hydrodynamics. Morphometric analysis revealed that high-hydrodynamics were favored by fish with a more fusiform body shape and body traits developed for propellant swimming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many microbial communities are characterized by high genetic diversity. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing can determine community members, and metagenomics can determine the functional diversity, but resolving the functional role of individual cells in high throughput remains an unsolved challenge. Here, we describe epicPCR (Emulsion, Paired Isolation and Concatenation PCR), a new technique that links functional genes and phylogenetic markers in uncultured single cells, providing a throughput of hundreds of thousands of cells with costs comparable to one genomic library preparation. We demonstrate the utility of our technique in a natural environment by profiling a sulfate-reducing community in a freshwater lake, revealing both known sulfate reducers and discovering new putative sulfate reducers. Our method is adaptable to any conserved genetic trait and translates genetic associations from diverse microbial samples into a sequencing library that answers targeted ecological questions. Potential applications include identifying functional community members, tracing horizontal gene transfer networks and mapping ecological interactions between microbial cells.

AB 1. Biological traits of organisms are expected to provide increased mechanistic understanding of species-environment relationships. Linking traits to environmental conditions is, however, not straightforward, as traits are interconnected within species and can affect the adaptive value of each other. The aim of our study was to evaluate the importance of these trait interrelationships for understanding environmental responses of freshwater macroinvertebrates.
   2. To this end, we investigated whether environmental responses of macroinvertebrates sharing a given trait were consistent or differed according to their taxonomy or to their other traits. We divided the macroinvertebrates into groups based on single traits (49 single-trait modalities), on taxonomy (10 orders) and on their overall trait profile (10 trait profile groups [TPGs], defined usingself-organising maps clustering). Abundances of each of these 69 groups were related to 24 environmental variables using boosted regression tree (BRT) modelling, to assess the environmental responses of single traits, orders and TPGs.
   3. Cross-validated predictive power (R-2) of the BRT models ranged from < 1% to 38%. Environmental responses of macroinvertebrates sharing a given trait were inconsistent and varied according to order and/or TPG. Single-trait responses often reflected the responses of the most abundant taxonomic group expressing the trait, suggesting that analysis of trait responses simply revealed patterns in habitat use by the most abundant species and not necessarily mechanistic relationships.
   4. Further, taxa from the same TPG (hence showing large overlap in their traits) but belonging to different orders showed different environmental responses. This indicates that the order a taxon belongs to confers unique information related to its evolutionary history that was not captured by our 49 trait modalities. However, groupings by orders cannot replace trait-based approaches, since TPGs also revealed differences in trait profiles within some orders, which were associated with different environmental responses.
   5. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple rather than single traits when linking macroinvertebrates to environmental variables, including the potential information conveyed by evolutionary history.

AB Historically, close attention has been paid to negative impacts associated with nutrient loads to streams and rivers, but today hydromorphological alterations are considered increasingly implicated when lowland streams do not achieve good ecological status. Here, we explore if trait-abundance patterns of aquatic plants change along gradients in hydromorphological degradation and eutrophication in lowland stream sites located in Denmark. Specifically, we hypothesised that: i) changes in trait-abundance patterns occur along gradients in hydromorphological degradation and ii) trait-abundance patterns can serve to disentangle effects of eutrophication and hydromorphological degradation in lowland streams reflecting that the mechanisms behind changes differ. We used monitoring data from a total of 147 stream reaches with combined data on aquatic plant species abundance, catchment land use, hydromorphological alterations (i.e. planform, cross section, weed cutting) and water chemistry parameters. Traits related to life form, dispersal, reproduction and survival together with ecological preference values for nutrients and light (Ellenberg N and L) were allocated to 41 species representing 79% of the total species pool. We found clear evidence that habitat degradation (hydromorphological alterations and eutrophication) mediated selective changes in the trait-abundance patterns of the plant community. Specific traits could distinguish hydromorphological degradation (free-floating, surface; anchored floating leaves; anchored heterophylly) from eutrophication (free-floating, submerged; leaf area). We provide a conceptual framework for interpretation of how eutrophication and hydromorphological degradation interact and how this is reflected in trait-abundance patterns in aquatic plant communities in lowland streams. Our findings support the merit of trait-based approaches in biomonitoring as they shed light on mechanisms controlling structural changes under environmental stress. The ability to disentangle several stressors is particularly important in lowland stream environments where several stressors act in concert since the impact of the most important stressor can be targeted first, which is essential to improve the ecological status.

AB Chironomidae are among the most conspicuous and ecological diverse group of freshwater invertebrates. They may dominate unimpacted communities in abundance and biomass, accounting for more than 50% of macroinvertebrate species in standing and flowing waters. In deep zones of eutrophic lakes and highly human-impacted streams, they are often the only family of aquatic insects remaining. In bioassessment programmes, Chironomids are often identified at the family and subfamily levels, due to difficulties in the taxonomic identification of larvae resulting from a high intrinsic morphological similarity. This may potentially result in bias as, similarly to Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera or Plecoptera, Chironomidae species, which are replaced along natural and human-impacted gradients due to differences in their ecological requirements. Recently, multiple trait-based approaches have been proposed to complement taxonomic-based assessment of streams and rivers using macroinvertebrates. However, the lack of specific trait information for Chironomidae prevents their use in the functional assessment of communities. Therefore, here, we aimed to: (1) develop a trait database for European Chironomidae genera that can be used in future bioassessment and ecological studies; (2) evaluate, by multivariate analyses, whether our new database provides additional information on Chironomidae compared to the trait information provided in the commonly used European trait database (Tachet et al., 2010); and (3) determine whether the new information on Eltonian traits (proxy to biological traits) translates the most accepted phylogenetic relationships among Chironomidae subfamilies. We gathered information on 744 species and 178 genera, for 37 traits covering 186 trait categories, and found substantial differences between our database and the commonly used European trait database. In addition, available information on traits was not always in agreement with phylogenetic relationships among subfamilies. Orthocladiinae and Chironominae which are considered sister groups in evolutionary terms actually showed confident trait relatedness based on Eltonian traits tree while the remaining relationships between subfamilies are questionable. In addition, different traits can occur in closely related taxa depending on the environmental drivers operating on their habitats. Our study reveals that the usually accepted redundancy within the Chironomidae family and subfamilies must be a product of averaging the information from finer taxonomic resolution added to the substantial lack of information for this insect group.

AB The performance of several indices of benthic functioning, based on the traits of estuarine macro-invertebrates, was tested in the lower Mondego estuary (Portugal), whose two arms exhibit different disturbance levels related to hydromorphology. The results showed that some indices responded clearly to this type of disturbance and others not so well. We argue that the community-weighted mean trait values (CWM) in combination with the newly developed SR-FRED index provided the best overall picture of how the benthic communities might have been affected by hydromorphological disturbance. This study also showed that certain indices should be used with caution when dealing with communities with few and dominant species, such as in estuarine environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fishing disturbance on ecosystems leads to changes in community structure and composition, which may have drastic implications for ecosystem functional performance. Functional redundancy, defined as species sharing similar functional roles, is a community property that plays an important role in preventing functional changes in ecosystems under pressure. In this study, we suggest that functional redundancy may be achieved through trait abundance (i.e. large amounts of a trait, hereafter "common traits"), or through trait richness (i.e. large numbers of distinct taxa exhibiting the same trait, hereafter "widespread traits"). We assessed the variability of both measures obtained from epifaunal and infaunal communities in soft-bottom trawling grounds. Sampling sites were located in four Mediterranean areas that were subjected to different levels of trawling effort. Common and widespread traits measures were based on the analysis of biological traits linked to key soft-bottoms functions such as nutrient cycling, bentho-pelagic coupling and habitat provision. The role of rare species in both measures was also assessed and we observed that, in our study sites, rare species generally exhibited the same traits as the most abundant species. Common and widespread traits measures provided complementary information on benthic functional redundancy. Thus, we suggest that a combination of the two measures should be used to appropriately assess benthic functional redundancy in trawling grounds. As redundancy is a component of ecosystem resilience, functional redundancy evaluation is important to assess the overall integrity of ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of channel complexity in maintaining biological integrity and ecosystem functioning has been addressed by several researchers. In spite of this, High-Andean streams are being channelized without regard to the effect that channelization might have on stream communities. To attempt to determine these effects, the present study evaluated how caddisfly assemblages respond to channelization in a High-Andean stream. A trait-based approach was used to compare trait-based responses, and the degree of functional homogenization caused by channelization. A total of seven traits are described: (i) 'Food,' (ii) 'Feeding habits,' (iii) 'Maximum body size,' (iv) 'Adaptation to flow constrains,' (v) 'Body flexibility,' (vi) 'Case-material,' and (vii) 'Case-shape.' Both the functional structure of the assemblages and the channel complexity of the channelized site were characterized and compared to those of two undisturbed sites. The results suggest that certain genera become dominant as a result of the environmental changes caused by partial channelization. Specifically, assemblages underwent significant specialization in 'Food,' 'Feeding habits,' and 'Case-shape,' and this was linked to the homogenization in mesohabitat type and in hydraulic variability. The trends evident in the trait-based responses may serve as a basis for proposing and assessing strategies to restore the hydromorphological integrity of High-Andean streams.

AB Although the assembly of stream macroinvertebrates is regulated by environmental heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales, field bioassessment studies that explicitly considered such scale-dependency are rare. Here, we investigated how large scale longitudinal gradients and local microhabitat structure jointly regulate the assembly of macroinvertebrate communities along a Mediterranean river. We compared community composition, metrics and functional feeding traits among three microhabitat categories (grain-size > 20 cm; grain-size < 20 cm; organic substrata) along three river sectors (up-, middle-, downstream), which reflected a gradient of anthropogenic modification. Macroinvertebrate assemblages varied mostly over the large-scale longitudinal gradient, but the influence of local micro-habitat features was evident at the within-sector scale. The effects of micro-habitats appeared stronger for feeding traits compared to simple taxonomic metrics, supporting the hypothesis that feeding traits are sensitive to river substratum character. Beta-diversity among micro-habitat types was smaller in the modified downstream sector, which supported more homogeneous communities. An explicit consideration of spatial scales is recommended when interpreting results from environmental assessment studies. In the Aniene River, the influence of local-scale substratum character on macroinvertebrates depended on the longitudinal gradient in anthropogenic pressure. Also, the findings suggest that taxonomic and functional metrics reflect processes operating at different spatial scales.

AB Benthic foraging by fish can modify the nature and rates of fine sediment accrual and the structure and topography of coarse-grained fluvial substrates, with the potential to alter bed material characteristics, particle entrainment thresholds, and bedload transport fluxes. However, knowledge of what controls the nature, extent, and intensity of benthic foraging and the consequent influence of these controls on geomorphic impact remain rudimentary. An ex-situ experiment utilising Barbel Barbus barbus and Chub Leuciscus cephalus extended previous work by considering the role of fish size and species as controls of sediment disturbance by foraging and the implications for bed material characteristics and bedload transport. In a laboratory flume, changes in bed microtopography and structure were measured when a water-worked bed of 5.6-22.6 mm gravels was exposed to four size classes of Barbel (4-5", 5-6", 6-8", 8-10" in length) and a single size class of Chub (8-10"). In line with other studies that have investigated animal size as a control of zoogeomorphic agency, increasing the size of Barbel had a significant effect on measured disturbance and transport metrics. Specifically, the area of disturbed substrate, foraging depth, and the fish's impact on microtopographic roughness and imbrication all increased as a function of fish size. In a comparison of the foraging effects of like-sized Barbel and Chub, 8-10" in length, Barbel foraged a larger area of the test bed and had a greater impact on microtopographic roughness and sediment structure. Relative to water-worked beds that were not foraged, bed conditioning by both species was associated with increased bedload transport during the subsequent application of high flows. However, the bedload flux after foraging by Barbel, which is a specialist benthivore, was 150% higher than that following foraging by Chub, which feed opportunistically from the bed, and the total transported mass of sediment was 98% greater. An interesting implication of these results, given the abundance and widespread distribution of foraging fish, is that numerous fish species belonging to a variety of functional groups may be acting as zoogeomorphic agents in rivers, directly affecting bed material conditions and sediment transport fluxes in proportion to their body size and feeding traits.

AB Shell composition is considered an important functional trait in testate amoebae community. Differences in the composition of shells may represent adaptations of these organisms to changes in the availability of environmental resources. We aimed to evaluate the influence of these environmental resources on the presence of different testate amoeba species, based on observation of one important functional trait (shell composition), in floodplain environments. We hypothesised that species diversity would increase with increased availability of food (chlorophyll-a; a critical environmental requirement). We also predicted that a higher concentration of suspended inorganic material would contribute to the occurrence of species that have an exogenous shell. Testate amoeba samples were taken between 2002 and 2011 in plankton of ten floodplain environments. A significant positive correlation was noted between the concentration of chlorophyll-a and the diversity of testate amoeba species according to a simple regression analysis. Furthermore, non-metric multidimensional scaling showed distinct groups with lower and higher concentration of suspended inorganic material. The occurrence of testate amoeba species with smaller exogenous shells was the most influenced by environments with higher concentrations of suspended inorganic material. Thus, our results emphasised that the evaluated environmental resources are important as assembly factors to shell traits in testate amoebae community.

AB Over the last decades, river lentification processes and droughts have been dramatically spreading worldwide, due to global and local drastic changes due to human activities. Under this scenario, the evaluation of physical disturbance caused by intermittency and droughts has become more and more relevant. In this research, we compare samples collected in Mediterranean streams following both traditional and experimental approaches with the aim of understanding if diatom indices calculated from a new sampling strategy could provide additional information for the physical disturbance assessment. Moreover, we also evaluated the response of functional metrics. Our results demonstrated that even though an enhanced sampling method better reflects hydrological disturbance than the traditional one, diatom indices do not detect it. Conversely, functional traits proved to be important metrics for the hydrological disturbance assessment. In particular, benthic diatom chlorophyll a showed significantly lower values in sections more subject to droughts. With respect to ecological guilds, the motile taxa proved to be linked to depositional areas, which resulted important microhabitats (MHs) to be explored in rivers affected by lentification. Including different MHs in the sampling process improves the information we can obtain from the analysis of the diatom community and presents important implications in documenting species distribution and autecology.

AB Changes to biodiversity have mainly been assessed using taxonomic diversity indices. Although these approaches contribute to our scientific understanding of species richness and composition patterns, trait-based metrics may be more useful for detecting responses to land-use change. We compared functional diversity of aquatic insect communities along a gradient of agricultural intensification. Our goal was to compare functional redundancy, functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence among natural ponds, and organic and conventional rice fields. We recorded 15606 aquatic insects distributed across 61 genera. The highest functional redundancy and richness were observed in the natural ponds, followed by organic rice fields and conventional ones. The functional composition varied among natural ponds and rice fields, and differed between organic and conventional rice fields. Organic management favoured the establishment of some pond insect traits, such as predatory taxa, in rice agroecosystems. Our analysis suggests that the conversion of ponds to rice fields results in a shift to less specialised aquatic insect communities with altered functional composition groups. Nevertheless, this result should not be seen as a negative reflection on organic rice fields, because organic rice production affords a better compromise between agricultural production and ecosystem function than conventional agriculture.

AB We investigated the functional trait responses to 5 nm metallic silver nanoparticle (AgNPs) exposure in the Lessepsian-entry bivalve B. pharaonis. Respiration rate (oxygen consumption), heartbeat rate, and absorption efficiency were evaluated across an 8-day exposure period in mesocosmal conditions. Basal reference values from not-exposed specimens were statistically compared with those obtained from animals treated with three sublethal nanoparticle concentrations (2 mu gL(-1), 20 mu gL(- 1), and 40 mu gL(-1)). Our data showed statistically significant effects on the average respiration rate of B. pharaonis. Moreover, complex nonlinear dynamics were observed as a function of the concentration level and time. Heartbeat rates largely increased with no acclimation in animals exposed to the two highest levels with similar temporal dynamics. Eventually, a decreasing trend for absorption efficiency might indicate energetic constraints. In general, these data support the possible impact of engineered nanomaterials in marine environments and support the relevance of functional trait assessment in present and future ecotoxicological studies.

AB The anatomy, functional morphology and evolutionary ecology of the Viviparidae, and the subfamily Bellamyinae in particular, are incompletely known. Partly as a result, genealogical relationships within the family remain poorly understood. Because of this lack in knowledge, few informed hypotheses exist on ancestral states, how differences in body plans between the subfamilies evolved, and how the peculiar biogeographic distribution patterns of viviparids have arisen. Here we document the anatomy, morphology, life history and systematics of Cipango-paludina japonica, a Japanese species that has been introduced into North America, to resolve taxonomic confusion and to improve our understanding of how form and function are related in bellamyines. Anatomical and histological examinations demonstrate marked differences between C. japonica and other bellamyines in the radula, salivary gland, kidney, nerve ring and reproductive organs. Substantial differences also exist between male and female body organization, but conchological differences between sexes in semi-landmark morphometric analyses are limited. The volume of the brood pouch of females, and hence body and shell size, appear to be good predictors of reproductive success, and the species' ecological versatility may relate to high fecundity and the ability to alternate between feeding modes. Comparing our observations on C. japonica with other viviparids and basal Architaenioglossa, we identify several persistent misinterpretations in the literature on how form and function are related in viviparids, not in the least as to female reproductive anatomy. Our reinterpretations improve understanding of the evolution of Viviparidae and its subfamilies, and hopefully will allow future workers to isolate key traits that shaped the evolution of viviparids at the taxonomic levels of their interest for more detailed studies.

AB Floods and droughts are 2 of the most influential factors affecting the structure and function of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in stream ecosystems. Even if these natural disturbances occur at the same magnitude at multiple research sites, the responses may differ according to stream type. In our study, we examined the various responses of functional feeding guilds (FFGs), related to the feeding methods and food types of macroinvertebrates, and habit trait guilds (HTGs), related to the mobility of macroinvertebrates and location of food obtained, to floods and droughts in different stream types (perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral). The stream types were categorised according to the stream flow conditions, flow permanence, and stream connectivity. Perennial streams were those maintaining continuous lotic habitats; intermittent streams were lotic habitats during periods of heavy rain but either connected or isolated pools during dry periods; and ephemeral streams existed only during the rainy season. Among the substrates, cobbles and boulders were highly dominant during heavy rain, especially in the first periods of heavy rain, whereas silt and sand were more often present in high proportions at intermittent stream sites. Across all stream types, highly intense and heavy rain led to a decrease in species richness and abundance, with changes in the composition of both FFGs and HTGs. Organisms characterised as scrapers and/or clingers (e.g., Ecdyonurus dracon, E. levis, and Simuliidae sp.), were highly resistant to high discharge compared to other FFGs or HTGs and were dominant during floods. In dry periods, the composition and richness of FFGs and HTGs were more affected at intermittent streams than at perennial streams. Long-lasting dry periods consistently reduced lotic habitat abundance and diversity and increased the amount of lentic habitats as well as zones with sedimentation, especially at intermittent stream sites, resulting in a decrease in collector-filterer organisms and an increase in burrowers (e.g., Ephemera strigata). Despite seasonal predictability, however, floods of relatively lower magnitude and intensity provided opportunities for some species, especially clingers (e.g., Epeorus pellucidus) and swimmers (e.g., Baetis fuscatus), to be introduced and/or become established in new habitats downstream in the ephemeral streams. Our research indicated that spatial (i.e., stream type) and temporal (i.e., floods and drying events) heterogeneities are the defining factors that influence functional diversity in benthic macroinvertebrate communities.

AB We revealed the functional groups of the animals of sod pinewood soils (arena of the river Dnepr in the "Dneprovsko-Orelsky" Nature Reserve) on the basis of cluster analysis of the RLQ-axes received as result of interaction of matrix of community, matrix of edaphic parameters and matrix of ecomorphs of soil animals. The quantitative account of soil mesofauna has allowed us to establish that the community of animals inhabiting sod pinewood soils is represented by 20 species at a density of 68.9 +/- 14.6 ind./m(2), 8 forms were identified at the level of genus, family or order. Two species were represented by their larval and imago phases (Anatolica eremita (Steven, 1829) and Calathus ambiguus (Paykull, 1790)). A count of animals conducted in an alternative way has allowed us to expand the list to 38 species or forms at species level. The level of abundance and diversity for sod pinewood soils on the arena is not high compared with other types of soils of the arena of the river Dnepr. This result shows that the community has a simplified ecological structure. The prevailing ecological structure of the community can be characterised as steppe, xerophilous, oligotrophocoenomorphic. Anecic animals are absent from the topomorphic structure and saprophagous animals absent from the trophic structure. Only additional collection by alternative methods has allowed us to establish the presence in the community of saprophagous and anecic animals. The latter ecological group is represented by the extremely mobile vertebrate species Pelobates fuscus. The foromorphic structure of the community differs by its great variety. In this structure various strategies of animals' movement through the soil are proportionately represented. On the one hand, we see various ways of movement of herpetobiont animals, mainly insect imagoes, which as a whole differ in their considerable migratory potential. This circumstance staticizes the historical reasons for the formation of the studied community. On the other hand, in the community there are various strategies of movement in the soil that allow us to assume or determine the reasons or causes of structurization of an ecological niche. Environmental factors are described by two groups of indicators, edaphic properties and values of phytoindicator scales. The mesopedobionts community structure is presented as a classical matrix of species/sampling points. The ecology of communities is principally focused not on taxonomic features but on biological properties (traits) of species. Such features can act on ecomorphs of soil animals. The direct functional analysis of relationship of biological properties of species with variables of environment by means of data on the abundance of species demands association of three matrixes of data. Such problem can be tackled by means of the RLQ-analysis. A key aspect of structurization of communities of soil mesofauna is differentiation in trophic traits. The organisation of a community of soil animals in an ecological space set by axes RLQ can be displayed in the form of a natural variation of RLQ-axes in geographical space. Everything in the RLQ is represented, as follows from the mathematical nature of this generalisation, an independent aspect of the coordinated variation of structure of a community of soil animals, properties of environment and ecomorphic features of mesopedobionts.

AB Geometric morphometrics (GM) and finite element analysis (FEA) are increasingly common techniques for the study of form and function. We show how principles of quantitative evolution in continuous phenotypic traits can link the two techniques, allowing hypotheses about the relative importance of different functions to be tested in a phylogenetic and evolutionary framework. Finite element analysis is used to derive quantitative surfaces that describe the comparative performance of different morphologies in a morphospace derived from GM. The combination of two or more performance surfaces describes a quantitative adaptive landscape that can be used to predict the direction morphological evolution would take if a combination of functions was selected for. Predicted paths of evolution also can be derived for hypotheses about the relative importance of multiple functions, which can be tested against evolutionary pathways that are documented by phylogenies or fossil sequences. Magnitudes of evolutionary trade-offs between functions can be estimated using maximum likelihood. We apply these methods to an earlier study of carapace strength and hydrodynamic efficiency in emydid turtles. We find that strength and hydrodynamic efficiency explain about 45% of the variance in shell shape; drift and other unidentified functional factors are necessary to explain the remaining variance. Measurement of the proportional trade-off between shell strength and hydrodynamic efficiency shows that throughout the Cenozoic aquatic turtles generally sacrificed strength for streamlining and terrestrial species favored stronger shells; this suggests that the selective regime operating on small to mid-sized emydids has remained relatively static.

AB Many South American characid fishes develop reversible dermal protuberances in the jaws to optimize aquatic surface respiration (ASR) during hypoxia. To date, basic aspects of this adaptation remain unknown, mainly due to the scarcity of experimental studies. In laboratory experiments, we determined time necessary for the complete formation and reversion of these structures in Piaractus mesopotamicus, and studied comparatively behavioral, morphological, and respiratory responses along gradients of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. Morphological changes during hypoxia consisted in dermal protuberances of lower lip, anterior border of maxillary and distal border of opercular valve, increasing the known number of structures modified. These structures developed completely in less than 6 hours and reversed in less than 3 hours. Most of observed traits showed a logistic response curve with threshold DO values between 0.90 and 2.70 mgL". Respiratory frequency and opercular valve development showed similar threshold values above the level of tolerance of DO, whereas ASR and dermal protuberances of the jaws showed threshold values below this level. This observation supports the functional link between these groups of behavioral and morphological traits. This study demonstrates that this species is able to modify reversibly portions of the respiratory system to optimize responses to hypoxia.

AB Understanding traits underlying colonization and niche breadth of invasive plants is key to developing sustainable management solutions to curtail invasions at the establishment phase, when efforts are often most effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate how two invasive congeners differing in ploidy respond to high and low resource availability following establishment from asexual fragments. Because polyploids are expected to have wider niche breadths than diploid ancestors, we predicted that a decaploid species would have superior ability to maximize resource uptake and use, and outperform a diploid congener when colonizing environments with contrasting light and nutrient availability. A mesocosm experiment was designed to test the main and interactive effects of ploidy (diploid and decaploid) and soil nutrient availability (low and high) nested within light environments (shade and sun) of two invasive aquatic plant congeners. Counter to our predictions, the diploid congener outperformed the decaploid in the early stage of growth. Although growth was similar and low in the cytotypes at low nutrient availability, the diploid species had much higher growth rate and biomass accumulation than the polyploid with nutrient enrichment, irrespective of light environment. Our results also revealed extreme differences in time to anthesis between the cytotypes. The rapid growth and earlier flowering of the diploid congener relative to the decaploid congener represent alternate strategies for establishment and success.

AB Our aim was to assess whether plant traitvalues and functional types are associated with environmental features in floodplain wetlands. The study was conducted in the Lower Parana River floodplain, mostly dominated by marsh communities. In 72 sites, 16 functional traits were screened for 95 plant populations of 44 species. Since the interspecific variability in trait values resulted higher than the intraspecific variability, plant species (and not populations) were hierarchically classified into plant functional types (PFTs). Ten PFTs were identified. Two trade-offs were observed: resource acquisition vs. resource conservation or resource assignment to tissues conferring anoxia or salinity tolerance, and fast growth vs. light interception. Cover-abundance of the PFTs and community-level weighted means (CWMs) of the non redundant traits were computed for 80 sites. Generalized linear models were used to assess the effect of environmental variables (landscape units, topographic positions, flooding frequency and eight soil variables) on the CWMs and on distribution of PFTs occurring in 15 sites or more. A two-stage modelling process was carried out to account for the presence-absence and cover-abundance of PFTs separately. The association between CWM5 and environmental features was relatively weak but significant for six out of the eight traits analysed. Besides, satisfactory models were found for eight out of the nine PFTs assessed. In the studied floodplain, PFTs-interpreted in terms of life strategies-seem to be a better approach than CWM5 to understand and characterise functional responses to the environment.

AB Scallop dredging is considered to be one of the most damaging forms of fishing to benthic habitats, although these effects vary among different habitats. The present study characterizes the biological communities that occur within the spatial limits of the English Channel king scallop dredge fishery in relation to key environmental drivers [mean seabed temperature; seabed temperature range; interannual temperature variation; bed shear stress (BSS); substrate characteristics; and depth] and across a gradient of scallop dredging intensity derived from vessel monitoring system data. Dredge fishing intensity was not correlated with species richness, species diversity, or species composition. However, increasing tidal BSS had a significant negative correlation with species richness and diversity. This outcome indicates that it is not possible to demonstrate that there is an effect of scallop fishing within the current spatial limits of the king scallop dredge fishery. This may be because historical dredge fishing could have already altered the benthic communities within the area of the scallop fishery to those that are resilient to scallop dredging, or that fishing disturbance has no impact over and above natural physical disturbance within the fishery. An analysis of biological and life history traits revealed that there was no relationship between recent fishing intensity, or BSS, and the functional composition of the communities present. However, even the lowest BSS values in the present study could be considered relatively high compared with areas outside the spatial boundaries of the fishery. Two distinct habitat groups were identified, based on the environmental drivers. These two groups were largely characterized by depth: deep (western) and shallow (eastern) sites. Species with traits that increase resilience to physical disturbance were abundant across all sample sites. Management concerning the environmental impacts of the fishery is discussed in terms of the spatial footprint of the fishery and predicted recovery time-scales for the associated benthic communities.

AB Anthropogenic disturbances affect ecosystem structure and functioning. The quantification of their impacts on highly diverse and structurally complex ecosystems, such as coral reefs, is challenging. These communities are facing rising fishing pressure, particularly on Pacific Islands such as New Caledonia. The main objective was to quantify harvesting effects on invertebrate assemblages across two contrasting habitats (soft-and hard-bottom), by comparing communities in marine protected areas (MPAs) with non-MPAs using 10 biological and ecological traits. Patterns of trait composition were compared with those of species composition by non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational analysis of variance analyses. Traits most responsible for differences between MPAs and non-MPAs were determined using SIMPER analysis, and predictions on shellfishing effects were discussed. A total of 248 species were recorded in hard-bottom communities, mainly characterized by mobile epifauna living on corals, crawling, and possessing a shell (molluscs) or a cuticle (crabs and echinoderms). Soft-bottom habitats contained 166 species, dominated by burrowing and sedentary species, especially shelled (largely bivalves) and worm-like organisms. Clear differences in species and trait composition between MPA and non-MPAs were highlighted in both habitats. Harvesting activities have community-wide effects that change the functional composition of invertebrate assemblages, in particular in terms of living habits and mobility. The observed shifts in benthic communities can affect the functioning of tropical coastal ecosystems and need to be included in small-scale fisheries management in poorly known tropical environments.

AB Darters (Perciformes, Percidae), sculpins (Perciformes, Cottidae), and gobioids (Gobiiformes, Gobioidei) exhibit convergent life history traits, including a benthic lifestyle and a cavity nesting spawning mode. Soniferous species within these taxa produce pulsed and/or tonal sounds with peak frequencies below 200 Hz (with some exceptions), primarily in agonistic and/or reproductive contexts. The reduced or absent swim bladders found in these taxa limit or prevent both hearing enhancement via pressure sensitivity and acoustic amplifi cation of the contracting sonic muscles, which are associated with the skull and pectoral girdle. While such anatomies constrain communication to low frequency channels, optimization of the S/N (signal-to-noise) ratio in low frequency channels is evident for some gobies, as measured by habitat soundscape frequency windows, nest cavity sound amplifi cation, and audiograms. Similar S/N considerations are applicable to many darter and sculpin systems. This chapter reviews the currently documented diversity of sound production in darters, sculpins, and gobioids within a phylogenetic context, examines the efficacy of signal transmission from senders to receivers (sound production mechanisms, audiograms, and masking challenges), and evaluates the potential functional significance of sound attributes in relation to territorial and reproductive behaviours.

AB Eokochia saxicola (Guss.) Freitag & G. Kadereit is a very rare and endangered endemic species of Southern Italy and one of the rarest plants in Europe. It grows only on calcareous or volcanic sea cliffs and is supposed to be the remnant of an old lineage, being considered an ancestor within the Chenolea Glade (tribe Camphorosmeae). Given that data on the biology and ecology of this species are limited, the aim of this study is to increase the knowledge of reproductive and vegetative structures and to investigate the occurrence and nature of potential critical steps in the life cycle affecting the species fitness. Micro- and macro-morphology of leaves, flowers and diaspores have been analysed together with seed germination in different environmental conditions.
   Morphological analyses have improved the description of the species (flowers are sub-ternate, subsessile at the axils of leaves and show protogyny) and highlighted the occurrence of peculiar and interesting characteristics of the epidermis, such as the presence of superhydrophobic surfaces both on the vegetative and reproductive structures. These surfaces are discussed with respect to removing dust and salt from leaves and protecting perianth from moulds. Seed germination is inhibited even by moderate environmental salinity but readily recovers in fresh water.
   Results are discussed with regard to the adaptive strategy of E. saxicola to the peculiar habitat of coastal cliffs, e.g., salinity stress and geographic isolation, and to the current hypothesis on the origin of the Chenolea Glade. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB The use of trait-based approaches to detect effects of land use and climate change on terrestrial plant and aquatic phytoplankton communities is increasing, but such a framework is still needed for benthic stream algae. Here we present a conceptual framework of morphological, physiological, behavioural and life-history traits relating to resource acquisition and resistance to disturbance. We tested this approach by assessing the relationships between multiple anthropogenic stressors and algal traits at 43 stream sites. Our "natural experiment" was conducted along gradients of agricultural land-use intensity (0-95% of the catchment in high-producing pasture) and hydrological alteration (0-92% streamflow reduction resulting from water abstraction for irrigation) as well as related physicochemical variables (total nitrogen concentration and deposited fine sediment). Strategic choice of study sites meant that agricultural intensity and hydrological alteration were uncorrelated. We studied the relationships of seven traits (with 23 trait categories) to our environmental predictor variables using general linear models and an information-theoretic model-selection approach. Life form, nitrogen fixation and spore formation were key traits that showed the strongest relationships with environmental stressors. Overall, FI (farming intensity) exerted stronger effects on algal communities than hydrological alteration. The large-bodied, non-attached, filamentous algae that dominated under high farming intensities have limited dispersal abilities but may cope with unfavourable conditions through the formation of spores. Antagonistic interactions between FI and flow reduction were observed for some trait variables, whereas no interactions occurred for nitrogen concentration and fine sediment. Our conceptual framework was well supported by tests of ten specific hypotheses predicting effects of resource supply and disturbance on algal traits. Our study also shows that investigating a fairly comprehensive set of traits can help shed light on the drivers of algal community composition in situations where multiple stressors are operating. Further, to understand non-linear and non-additive effects of such drivers, communities need to be studied along multiple gradients of natural variation or anthropogenic stressors.

AB Body size is a fundamental functional trait that can be used to forecast individuals' responses to environmental change and their contribution to ecosystem functioning. However, information on the mean and variation of size distributions often confound one another when relating body size to aggregate functioning. Given that size-based metrics are used as indicators of ecosystem status, it is important to identify the specific aspects of size distributions that mediate ecosystem functioning. Our goal was to simultaneously account for the mean, variance, and shape of size distributions when relating body size to aggregate ecosystem functioning. We take advantage of habitat-specific differences in size distributions to estimate nutrient recycling by a non-native crayfish using mean-field and variance-incorporating approaches. Crayfishes often substantially influence ecosystem functioning through their omnivorous role in aquatic food webs. As predicted from Jensen's inequality, considering only the mean body size of crayfish overestimated aggregate effects on ecosystem functioning. This bias declined with mean body size such that mean-field and variance- incorporating estimates of ecosystem functioning were similar for samples at mean body sizes >7.5 g. At low mean body size, mean-field bias in ecosystem functioning mismatch predictions from Jensen's inequality, likely because of the increasing skewness of the size distribution. Our findings support the prediction that variance around the mean can alter the relationship between body size and ecosystem functioning, especially at low mean body size. However, methods to account for mean-field bias performed poorly in samples with highly skewed distributions, indicating that changes in the shape of the distribution, in addition to the variance, may confound mean-based estimates of ecosystem functioning. Given that many biological functions scale allometrically, explicitly defining and experimentally or statistically isolating the effects of the mean, variance, and shape of size distributions is necessary to begin generalizing relationships between animal body size and ecosystem functioning.

AB Wetlands are commonly limited in available nitrogen. But marshes in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeastern China suffer large amounts of exogenous nitrogen from agriculture fertilization after wetland reclamation. This paper focuses on the ecological effects of a short-term increase of nitrogen input on collembolan communities. Our results show a significant decrease in collembolan abundance and Shannon diversity index, and the abundance of euedaphic and hemiedaphic collembolans decreased faster than epedaphic collembolans. These results indicate that euedaphic or hemiedaphic fauna suffer more biodiversity loss caused by nitrogen deposition than epedaphic fauna and call for more researches on trait-based approaches under environmental stress in the future.

AB Aims: Lowland meadow irrigation used to be a widespread management practice to improve hay yield in Central European grasslands. Recently, traditional meadow irrigation is being re-established in some parts of Europe. Nevertheless, the consequences of the regular artificial flooding on vegetation of these water meadows remain poorly understood. We studied the impact of flood irrigation on the plant functional and species composition of extensively managed hay meadows.
   Location: Lowland of River Queich, between Landau and Lustadt, Germany.
   Methods: We sampled vegetation in 34 meadows that differed in irrigation status (irrigated/non-irrigated) and fertilization (unfertilized/fertilized). Plants were classified into functional groups according to growth forms, N-fixing ability and reproductive strategy. Effects of meadow irrigation on the plant functional composition were analysed using two complementary approaches. In the 'community approach', we analysed total cover of each functional group per meadow with respect to irrigation and fertilization. In the 'species approach', we analysed the mean response to irrigation among the species within the defined functional groups.
   Results: Total cover of rosettes and semi-rosettes increased relative to graminoids in irrigated meadows. Cover of legumes was three times higher in irrigated compared to non-irrigated meadows. Irrigation enhanced preferences for seed and vegetative reproduction. However, the response of individual species within the functional groups was inconsistent. Fertilization had an overall minor influence on functional composition of the meadows.
   Conclusions: The higher proportion of plants with basal growth organs in irrigated meadows suggests that irrigation may enhance a more complex vertical structure of the vegetation. Enhancement of rosettes, semi-rosettes and legumes at the cost of graminoids through irrigation was more significant in the community than in the species approach, indicating that the functional group response was amplified by the respective dominant species. This highlights the importance of considering species-level interactions in functional vegetation analysis.

AB How climate change will affect the community dynamics and functionality of lake ecosystems during winter is still little understood. This is also true for phytoplankton in seasonally ice-covered temperate lakes which are particularly vulnerable to the presence or absence of ice. We examined changes in pelagic phytoplankton winter community structure in a north temperate lake (Muggelsee, Germany), covering 18 winters between 1995 and 2013. We tested how phytoplankton taxa composition varied along a winter-severity gradient and to what extent winter severity shaped the functional trait composition of overwintering phytoplankton communities using multivariate statistical analyses and a functional trait-based approach. We hypothesized that overwintering phytoplankton communities are dominated by taxa with trait combinations corresponding to the prevailing winter water column conditions, using ice thickness measurements as a winter-severity indicator. Winter severity had little effect on univariate diversity indicators (taxon richness and evenness), but a strong relationship was found between the phytoplankton community structure and winter severity when taxon trait identity was taken into account. Species responses to winter severity were mediated by the key functional traits: motility, nutritional mode, and the ability to form resting stages. Accordingly, one or the other of two functional groups dominated the phytoplankton biomass during mild winters (i.e., thin or no ice cover; phototrophic taxa) or severe winters (i.e., thick ice cover; exclusively motile taxa). Based on predicted milder winters for temperate regions and a reduction in ice-cover durations, phytoplankton communities during winter can be expected to comprise taxa that have a relative advantage when the water column is well mixed (i.e., need not be motile) and light is less limiting (i.e., need not be mixotrophic). A potential implication of this result is that winter severity promotes different communities at the vernal equinox, which may have different nutritional quality for the next trophic level and ecosystem-scale effects.

AB Comparative genomic studies of closely related species typically focus on single species pairs at one given stage of divergence. That makes it difficult to infer the continuum of evolutionary process during speciation and beyond. Here, we use whole-genome resequencing to examine genomic patterns of divergence in three sympatric cichlid species pairs with very similar functional and ecological differentiation, but different ages. We find a strong signature of increasing genomic divergence with time in both the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome. In contrast to many other systems, we find that in these cichlids, regions of elevated relative differentiation also exhibit increased absolute differentiation. We detect a signature of convergent evolution in a comparison of outlier regions across all three species pair comparisons, but the extent of it is modest, and regions that are strongly divergent in any one pair tend to be only slightly elevated in the other pairs, consistent with a repeatable but polygenic basis of traits that characterize the ecomorphs. Our results suggest that strong functional phenotypic differentiation, as seen in all three species pairs, is generally associated with a clear signature of genomic divergence, even in the youngest species pair.

AB Nonwadeable rivers are unique ecosystems that support high levels of aquatic biodiversity, yet they have been greatly altered by human activities. Although riverine fish assemblages have been studied in the past, we still have an incomplete understanding of how fish assemblages respond to both natural and anthropogenic influences in large rivers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate associations between fish assemblage structure and reach-scale habitat, dam, and watershed land use characteristics. In the summers of 2011 and 2012, comprehensive fish and environmental data were collected from 33 reaches in the Iowa and Cedar rivers of eastern-central Iowa. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to evaluate environmental relationships with species relative abundance, functional trait abundance (e.g. catch rate of tolerant species), and functional trait composition (e.g. percentage of tolerant species). On the basis of partial CCAs, reach-scale habitat, dam characteristics, and watershed land use features explained 25.0-81.1%, 6.2-25.1%, and 5.8-47.2% of fish assemblage variation, respectively. Although reach-scale, dam, and land use factors contributed to overall assemblage structure, the majority of fish assemblage variation was constrained by reach-scale habitat factors. Specifically, mean annual discharge was consistently selected in nine of the 11 CCA models and accounted for the majority of explained fish assemblage variance by reach-scale habitat. This study provides important insight on the influence of anthropogenic disturbances across multiple spatial scales on fish assemblages in large river systems.

AB Aim Despite a long-standing research interest in the association between the biodiversity (i.e. taxonomic and functional composition) and trophic structure of communities, our understanding of the relationship remains limited. Community assembly theory predicts that niche partitioning will result in communities with a diverse array of functional traits, which in turn may facilitate a correspondingly diverse array of trophic interactions that define the trophic niche of those communities. The aim of our study is to test this prediction.
   Location North America.
   Methods We built a database composed of functional traits and stable isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) for 63 freshwater fish communities containing 109 species in 34 lentic and 29 lotic ecosystems. First, using linear mixed models (i.e. an alpha-diversity approach), we tested whether the taxonomic diversity of communities was positively associated with their functional diversity and if their functional diversity was positively associated with their trophic diversity. Second, we assessed the taxonomic, functional and trophic similarity of communities using multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM) and their respective 'turnover' and 'nestedness-resultant' components to test if the taxonomic similarity of communities was positively correlated with their functional similarity and if their functional similarity was positively associated with their trophic similarity (i.e. a beta-diversity approach).
   Results We found that the functional diversity of communities increased as their taxonomic diversity increased. Similarly, the trophic diversity of communities increased as their functional diversity increased. The pairwise taxonomic and functional similarity of communities were also positively associated, but there was a weak relationship between the functional and trophic similarities of communities.
   Main conclusions Our study demonstrates that communities with similar functional characteristics can have disparate food web structures, suggesting that additional site-specific factors influence community variation in trophic niche geometry. Determining the relative importance of functional characteristics and site-specific factors in shaping trophic interactions is crucial for a better understanding of how future species loss and species introductions will affect food web structure and ecosystem functioning.

AB Humans are rapidly altering thermal landscapes, so a central challenge to organismal ecologists is to better understand the thermal niches of ectotherms. However, there is much disagreement over how we should go about this. Some ecologists assume that a statistical model of abundance as a function of habitat temperature provides a sufficient approximation of the thermal niche, but ecophysiologists have shown that the relationship between fitness and temperature can be complicated, and have stressed the need to elucidate the causal mechanisms underlying the response of species to thermal change. Towards this end, we studied the distribution of two crayfishes, Euastacus woiwuru and Euastacus armatus, along an altitudinal gradient, and for both species conducted experiments to determine the temperature-dependence of: (1) aerobic scope (the difference between maximum and basal metabolic rate; purported to be a proxy of the thermal niche); and (2) burst locomotor performance (primarily fuelled using anaerobic pathways). E. woiwuru occupied cooler habitats than E. armatus, but we found no difference in aerobic scope between these species. In contrast, locomotor performance curves differed significantly and strongly between species, with peak locomotor performances of E. woiwuru and E. armatus occurring at similar to 10 and similar to 18 A degrees C, respectively. Crayfish from different thermal landscapes may have similar aerobic thermal performance curves but different anaerobic thermal performance curves. Our results support a growing body of literature implying different components of ectotherm fitness have different thermal performance curves, and further challenge our understanding of the ecology and evolution of thermal niches.

AB Improving models that depict the components of net primary production (NPP) in ecosystems will help us to better understand how climate change and human activities affect the biosphere. In this study, NPPgap was introduced into the present human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) framework. We introduced NPPgap in this study as potential NPP (NPPpot) minus the sum of ecosystem NPP (NPPeco) and HANPP, which relates to the ability of models to depict NPP components. Using the Lhasa River region of the Tibetan Plateau, we examined temporal and spatial variations in the components of NPP over a 10-year period. Results showed that NPPpot, HANPP and NPPeco increased from 2000 to 2010, but at different rates and with different spatial patterns. NPPgap each year ranged from -9.2% to 13.1% for each site and on average composed 1.2% of the total NPPpot. NPPgap was significantly correlated with precipitation, plant biodiversity, plant height and soil properties. NPPgap increased if either of the previous 2 years had been wet years with relative high precipitation. An increase in the richness of palatable species would lead to a larger NPPgap through more compensatory growth. The large fluctuation level of NPPgap reflected the higher stability of vegetation productivity, which is caused by higher plant heights and soil maximum water capacity. This study showed the potential of the HANPP framework in regional assessment of climate and human impacts on net primary productivity. The use of the NPPgap measure reflects the gap in our knowledge and our ability to accurately estimate the components of NPP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Geographical information systems (GIS)-based approaches support the traditional empirical assessment and monitoring measures to indicate large-scale environmental alterations caused by global change. We examined the relationship between cover patterns of emergent aquatic plants derived from the CORINE land cover database, and environmental gradients (i.e. lake, climate and land cover and soil variables) at four different buffer scales (50 m, 100 m, 300 m and 500 m) in 408 boreal lakes in Finland. Our main statistical methods were hierarchical partitioning (HP), generalized linear models (GLM) and variation partitioning (VP).
   Based on correlations and HP, the importance of different buffer zones varied between environmental variables in explaining the vegetation cover. Our study also demonstrated that landscape productivity variables (i.e. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Tasseled Cap Greenness) strongly structured the vegetation cover. These productivity variables proved to be proxies for agricultural land and nutrient leaching from terrestrial areas to water, but they were also associated with shading of riparian vegetation. In the VP, land cover and soil variable groups influenced emergent vegetation cover the most, followed by lake and, lastly, by climate variables.
   Our work emphasized the importance of spatial scale in structuring freshwater assemblages that should be taken into account in ecological research and bioassessment. The use of a single spatial scale may lead to flawed results on the relevance of various environmental gradients on freshwater assemblages. Moreover, our study showed that satellite-based productivity variables can be powerful proxies for the amount of nutrients eventually entering aquatic ecosystems from adjacent terrestrial areas. The GIS-based approach used here provided an ecologically sound and cost-efficient early-warning estimation of vegetation overgrowth in boreal lakes. This approach is applicable to other regions with similar land cover data sets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lactoferrin (LTF) is a multi-functional protein belonging to the whey protein fractions of milk. The gene LTF encoding for such protein is considered a potential candidate for body measurement, milk composition and yield. This study reports on the genetic variability at the LTF locus in the Italian Mediterranean river buffalo and its possible association with milk yield. Eleven polymorphic sites were found in the DNA fragment spanning exons 15-16. In particular, intron 15 was extremely polymorphic with nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected, whereas the remaining two SNPs were exonic mutations (g.88G > A at exon 15 and g.1351G > A at exon 16) and both synonymous. The genotyping of the informative samples evidenced three haplotypes, whose frequencies were 0.6, 0.3 and 0.1, respectively, whereas the analysis of the exonic SNPs showed a perfect condition of linkage disequilibrium (g.88A/g.1351G and g.88G/g. 1351A). The association study carried out by using the SNP g.88G > A showed that buffalo LTF gene has no statistically significant influence on daily milk yield. This study adds knowledge to the genetic variability of a species less investigated than the other ruminant species. These findings may serve as a useful tool for large-scale screening of buffalo populations.

AB Understanding the patterns of biological diversity between different regions (beta diversity) and how diversity is generated and maintained is a central goal in ecology. The relative roles of niche differentiation and geographical distances in shaping the phytoplankton and zooplankton structures are not yet fully determined, especially considering the subsets of species that share particular traits. We evaluated whether dissimilarity in phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages depends on environmental distances and geographical distances on the whole communities and for subsets. We sampled eight hydroelectric reservoirs over a large scale (1500 km) in central Brazil, during three climatological periods. Phytoplankton composition was correlated with niche differentiation; that is, environmental similarity would account for assemblage similarity, due to the high dispersal abilities and low turnover rates of these organisms. For zooplankton, geographical distances were more important, which resulted in a stronger spatial structure with a greater dispersal limitation. For phytoplankton, the Morphologically Based Functional Group formed by diatoms, and for zooplankton, the three major taxonomic groups appeared as spatially structured. Therefore, phytoplankton composition was mostly correlated to niche differentiation and zooplankton to geographical distances; the communities deconstructed into subsets of species with similar traits refined the responses of the community structures.

AB We explored phytoplankton communities from a functional perspective in two connected but hydro-morphologically distinct basins during the ice-free period in the cold and oligotrophic Lake Tovel, Italy. Despite the absence of dispersal barriers, we expected a clear separation of the phytoplankton communities between basins based on their physical distinctions: a shallow and a deep basin with low and high water residence time, respectively. To investigate seasonal succession and spatiality, taxa were classified according to their functional groups (FGs) and traits (FTs). Relationships between functional classifications and environmental parameters were assessed by non-metric multidimensional scaling integrated with cluster analysis. Clustering of FGs and FTs was complementary and reflected different hydrological conditions of each basin: (i) more stable conditions and higher functional variation across seasons in the deep basin and (ii) less stable conditions and lower functional variation across seasons in the shallow basin. Phytoplankton functional composition evidenced how local conditions selected for corresponding functional attributes adapted to each basin's environment. These results, together with the presence of rare, cold-tolerant taxa such as PseudotetraA << driella kamillae and Stephanocostis chantaicus, highlighted the need for long-term phytoplankton studies, and the creation of a FG that includes cold-adapted, oligotrophic taxa.

AB Understanding spatial and temporal changes in species composition has long demanded the attention of ecologists. However, only recently questions related to changes in species functional traits have been investigated. We explored patterns of species and functional dissimilarity of periphytic algae at six lakes sampled over a year across a subtropical floodplain. We evaluated the importance of turnover and nestedness components across space and time; the influence of environmental dissimilarity, spatial distance, and time on species and functional dissimilarity; and whether functional dissimilarity results from non-stochastic assembly processes. We used six functional traits to describe 155 species. Functional dissimilarity was estimated by functional dendrograms, and stochasticity was evaluated using null models. The turnover component was greater than nestedness for species and functional dissimilarity. Environmental dissimilarity, spatial distance, or time did not significantly explain species or functional dissimilarity. However, functional dissimilarity was significantly greater than expected given the observed species dissimilarity. The main finding of this study is that community assembly was deterministic with respect to traits. Further, each lake contributed similarly to the overall species and traits pool. These results highlight the importance of comparing species and functional dissimilarities to reach a better understanding of the organization of periphytic algal communities.

AB A primary aim of community ecology is to determine mechanisms that shape community structure. In this study, we used trait-based and phylogenetic community ecology approaches to determine the factors underlying the species assemblage of black fly larvae in tropical streams of Thailand. Ecological data were obtained from 150 collections. Morphological traits were measured from 35 species. The phylogenetic relationship of these species was inferred from cytochrome c oxidase I, II, and 18S rRNA/ITS1 sequences. Phylogeny-based community analyses indicated that species in the community did not skew toward phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion. However, the trait-based community structure analysis based on labral fan morphology revealed that species in most (>78%) communities were more similar morphologically than expected by chance. As labral fan morphology is strongly related to habitat exploitation, it is considered that habitat filtering is a major factor shaping community structure of black fly larvae in tropical streams of Thailand.

AB Rising temperatures are expected to favour the growth of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in temperate lakes, but may also change the composition of cyanobacterial communities. To predict future community and bloom dynamics, it is therefore important to understand how bloom-forming species respond to temperature. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenayya & Subba Raju is an invasive, toxin-producing, nitrogen-fixer that may benefit from warming. To understand how changing temperatures will influence its ability to compete against native North American bloom-formers, we characterized the thermal reaction norms and temperature traits of three C. raciborskii strains, four strains of Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutzing) Kutzing and one strain of Anabaena flos-aquae (Lyng.) Breb. C. raciborskii strains had higher optimum temperatures and survived higher temperatures than toxic M. aeruginosa strains, but had no apparent advantage over the non-toxic M. aeruginosa strain or A. flosaquae. M. aeruginosa strains and A. flos-aquae tolerated lower temperatures than C. raciborskii, suggesting that fitness differences at low temperature may be important in limiting the latter's spread. Furthermore, we found that nutrient availability strongly influenced thermal reaction norm shape: nitrogen deprivation lowered growth rates and decreased both low-and high-temperature tolerance, but did not affect the optimum temperature in C. raciborskii.

AB The objective of the present research is to draw a comprehensive picture of the integrated response mechanisms of 'SeaSpray' seashore paspalum, a recently released seeded cultivar, to controlled short-term salinity conditions. A solution culture study was performed during a two weeks time-course experiment. In addition its ability to recover in terms of photochemistry activity was examined, at the highest salinity level after seven days of rewatering with distilled water only. To quantify growth and physiological responses to salinity (NaCl), plants were divided into five treatments and grown across a range of salinities (0-600 mM). Although exposure to severe salinity stress 14 days after treatment (DAT) was sufficient to affect biomass fresh weight, dry weight production was not affected. The photon yield of PSII and non-photochemical quenching responded to the strength of the stress applied, whereas the maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry declined only in the highest salinity stress level after 14 DAT. However, the rapid and full recovery of the main chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters upon rewatering confirms the hardy tolerance of the species to such stress conditions. Functional changes were observed in pigment and carbohydrate content and composition among different treatments, especially after 14 DAT. The use of multicanonical analysis revealed the canonical relationship between the treatment fingerprints obtained from biometric and physiological data. Overall, our dataset suggests the use of straight seawater or brackish water for this salt tolerant species, creating the opportunity to develop turfgrass landscapes in arid and seashore regions.

AB Bottom trawl fishing has widespread impacts on benthic habitats and communities. The benthic response to trawling seems to be smaller or absent in areas exposed to high natural disturbance, leading to the hypothesis that natural and trawl disturbance affect benthic communities in a similar way. However, systematic tests of this hypothesis at large spatial scales and with data from sites spanning a large range of natural disturbance do not exist. Here, we examine the effects of trawl and natural (tidal-bed shear stress) disturbance on benthic communities over gradients of commercial bottom trawling effort in 8 areas in the North and Irish Seas. Using a trait-based approach, that classified species by life-history strategies or by characteristics that provide a proxy for their role in community function, we found support for the hypothesis that trawl and natural disturbance affect benthic communities in similar ways. Both sources of disturbance caused declines in long-living, hard-bodied (exoskeleton) and suspension-feeding organisms. Given these similar impacts, there was no detectable trawling effect on communities exposed to high natural disturbance. Conversely, in 3 out of 5 areas with low bed shear stress, responses to trawling were detected and resulted in community compositions comparable with those in areas subject to high natural disturbance, with communities being composed of either small-sized, deposit-feeding animals or mobile scavengers and predators. The findings highlight that knowledge of the interacting effects of trawl and natural disturbance will help to identify areas that are more or less resilient to trawling and support the development of management plans that account for the environmental effects of fishing.

AB Grafting has been widely used in vegetables, particularly in the plants of Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae families because of its many significant advantages. Substantial studies have revealed that grafting can affect the yield and fruit quality of tomato through the vigorous rootstocks as reported previously. The selection of rootstocks plays an important role in improving the fruit yield and quality of scions. Lycium species (popularly known as goji or goji berry), also belonging to the Solanaceae family, is widely used as the functional fruits and vegetables, as well as traditional Chinese herbs. Goji plants also exhibit the excellent salt-tolerant ability. The intergeneric grafting across different genera, importantly with tomato and plant from different genus is little described. In this study, two commercial cultivars of tomato, Zhongshu 5 (ZS5) and TA209 as scions were grafted on goji plants (L. chinense Mill.), and the growth and fruit quality of tomato were investigated. The ungrafted self-rooted tomato plants were used as the control plants. The results showed that the growth of the grafted tomato plants was slightly depressed by grafting at the early development, but was restored like the self-rooted plants during the late development, and the net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content were higher in the grafted plants' leaves at the fruit ripening stage. The size, shape, fresh weight and pigmentation pattern of tomato fruits were remarkably affected by grafting. Grafting produced smaller tomato fruit with lower fresh weight. An interesting observation was noticed that the pigmentation pattern of tomato fruits was close to that of goji berry. Some traits associated with fruit quality were improved by grafting approach, including total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), ratio of TSS/TA and vitamin C (Vc). The natural amino acids and nine mineral elements in tomato fruits were also affected by grafting. It was suggested that the increase of fruit quality may be attributed to the reduction of fruit water content and the effect of rootstock. This is the first report on intergeneric grafting between tomato and goji plants. The grafting procedure had a remarkable influence on the growth and fruit quality of tomato plants. With the perspective of high salt-tolerance of goji rootstocks, it is well worthy to study the performance of grafted tomato under saline condition in future. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Despite the expected increase in extreme flood frequency, the manner in which terrestrial arthropods cope with regular submersion of their habitat remains poorly understood in meadows, especially in temperate floodplains. Here, we studied the recolonization dynamics of arthropods after a severe spring flood in the Loire Valley (France). We carried out analyses at the community (order or family identification level) and species scales, focusing on the assemblages of two dominant and diverse groups: carabids and spiders. Our objectives were the following: (i) to describe the temporal changes in community structure after flooding and (ii) to assess the influence of landscape configuration on recolonization patterns of species and their functional traits. Fieldwork was performed along three sampling transects, by using 75 pitfall traps, in 2012. A total of 14767 arthropods belonging to 87 families were trapped, including 5538 spiders (55 species) and 3396 carabids (66 species). Multivariate analyses discriminated assemblages from flooded and non-flooded habitats and revealed changes over time in arthropod families and species after flood withdrawal. In particular, wolf spiders (Lycosidae) were the first to recolonize, whereas other groups clearly avoided flooded sites. Our results also revealed that short distances to hedgerows, and to a lesser extent, distance to woodlands, favoured the recolonization of large and ground-running spiders. In conclusion, our study shows the short-term resilience of certain groups or stenotopic species to flooding and also the relevance of multi-taxon-based studies. The presence of hedgerows has to be considered carefully in management plans because of their role of refuge during flooding. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Phytoplankton are key components of aquatic ecosystems, fixing CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and supporting secondary production, yet relatively little is known about how future global warming might alter their biodiversity and associated ecosystem functioning. Here, we explore how the structure, function, and biodiversity of a planktonic metacommunity was altered after five years of experimental warming. Our outdoor mesocosm experiment was open to natural dispersal from the regional species pool, allowing us to explore the effects of experimental warming in the context of metacommunity dynamics. Warming of 4 degrees C led to a 67% increase in the species richness of the phytoplankton, more evenly-distributed abundance, and higher rates of gross primary productivity. Warming elevated productivity indirectly, by increasing the biodiversity and biomass of the local phytoplankton communities. Warming also systematically shifted the taxonomic and functional trait composition of the phytoplankton, favoring large, colonial, inedible phytoplankton taxa, suggesting stronger top-down control, mediated by zooplankton grazing played an important role. Overall, our findings suggest that temperature can modulate species coexistence, and through such mechanisms, global warming could, in some cases, increase the species richness and productivity of phytoplankton communities.

AB Sexual dimorphism in ecologically relevant traits is ubiquitous in animals. However, other types of intraspecific phenotypic divergence, such as trophic polymorphism, are less common. Because linkage to sex should often lead to balancing selection, understanding the association between sex and phenotypic divergence could help explain why particular species show high morphological variability. To determine if sexual dimorphism could be helping to maintain ecomorphological variation in a classic case of intraspecific trophic polymorphism, we examined the association between sex and morphological divergence in the cichlid Herichthys minckleyi. Although H. minckleyi with enlarged molariform teeth on their pharyngeal jaws have been reported to more commonly be male, we did not find an association between sex and pharyngeal morphotype. Sex was associated with divergence in body size (as measured through standard length). But, sex was not associated with any of the other trophic traits examined. However, pharyngeal morphotype did show an association with gut length, gape, and tooth number. Sexual dimorphism is not playing a central role in enhancing trophic diversity within H. minckleyi.

AB Aim The need to go beyond taxonomy to understand patterns in microbial function has led to an increased use of trait-based approaches, yet we know little about how microbial functional traits vary across large-scale environmental gradients in natural ecosystems. Here, we apply a trait-based approach to explore the large-scale variability in the trait structure underlying the processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by boreal bacterioplankton communities, as well as its regulation and links to taxonomic composition.
   Location Samples were collected from 296 rivers and lakes across five regions in northern Quebec (Canada), which span large gradients in environmental, climatic and geographical properties typical of the boreal zone.
   Methods We used the metabolic profiles obtained with Biolog EcoPlates as an imprint of the trait structure underlying bacterial processing of DOM, and Illumina sequencing of the 16SrRNA gene to characterize the taxonomic composition of these bacterial assemblages. The resulting spatial patterns were compared with an array of climatic, landscape and limnological properties varying at the landscape scale.
   Results Despite a clear regional segregation of the sampled sites based on environmental variables, the trait structure of boreal bacteria did not show any regional or ecosystem-specific patterns, but rather was linked to a gradient of quality of DOM. Community trait configurations diverged progressively with decreasing terrestrial influence, probably due to local processes that transform and diversify the available pool of DOM. This DOM quality gradient did not explain the taxonomic biogeography of these communities, which was controlled by a different set of environmental factors.
   Main conclusions The functional biogeography of boreal bacterioplankton is driven by the nature of the DOM pool, and particularly by the influence of terrestrial DOM. The lack of coherence between functional and taxonomic biogeographies implies that the environmental controls of freshwater bacterial performance cannot be directly inferred from spatial patterns in taxonomic composition.

AB Previous studies investigating community-level relationships between plant functional trait characteristics and stream environmental characteristics remain scarce. Here, we used community-weighted means to identify how plant traits link to lowland stream typology and how agricultural intensity in the catchment affects trait composition. We analysed plant trait characteristics in 772 European lowland streams to test the following two hypotheses: (i) trait characteristics differ between plant communities in small and medium-sized streams, reflecting adaptations to different habitat characteristics, and (ii) trait characteristics vary with the intensity of agricultural land use in the stream catchment, mediated either directly by an increase in productive species or indirectly by an increase in species that efficiently intercept and utilize light. We found that the communities in small streams were characterized by a higher abundance of light-demanding species growing from single apical meristems, reproducing by seeds and rooted to the bottom with floating and/or heterophyllous leaves, whereas the community in medium-sized streams was characterized by a higher abundance of productive species growing from multi-apical and basal growth meristems forming large canopies. We also found indications that community trait characteristics were affected by eutrophication. We did not find enhanced abundance of productive species with an increasing proportion of agriculture in the catchments. Instead, we found an increase in the abundance of species growing from apical and multi-apical growth meristems as well as in the abundance of species tolerant of low light availability. The increase in the abundance of species possessing these traits likely reflects different strategies to obtain greater efficiency in light interception and utilization in nutrient-enriched environments.Synthesis and applications. Our findings challenge the general assumption of the EU Water Framework Directive compliant assessment systems that plant community patterns in streams reflect the nutrient preference of the community. Instead, light availability and the ability to improve interception and utilization appeared to be of key importance for community composition in agricultural lowland streams. We therefore suggest moving from existing approaches building on species-specific preference values for nutrients to determine the level of nutrient impairment to trait-based approaches that provide insight into the biological mechanisms underlying the changes. We recommend that existing systems are critically appraised in the context of the findings of this study.

AB This study shows that functional grouping of the species based on nitrogen fixing ability along with initial leaf litter C/P, C/N, P and N could help us predicting leaf litter decomposition rate.
   Grouping species into functional groups is a good approach to understanding exotic plants impacts on ecosystem functioning in their new environment. One key plant trait that has large ecosystem-level consequences is the ability of plants to fix atmospheric nitrogen into plant available forms. Most previous studies have reported faster leaf litter decomposition rates of nitrogen fixing than non-nitrogen-fixing species, supporting the separation of these as functional groups. Here, we present a multispecies monitoring of litter decomposability of seven tree species in a 1 year decomposition experiment in outdoor litter bed common garden experiment in river floodplain in South Western Iran. We tested within- and between-functional-groups for rates of leaf litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics. Our results highlight that nitrogen-fixing trees and non-nitrogen-fixing trees can be distinguished based on specific leaf area and leaf litter traits. The interesting results were that the leaf litter decomposition rates of the two functional groups were related to different initial leaf litter traits. Leaf litter decomposition rates of nitrogen-fixing trees were related to initial leaf litter C/P, C/N, N, P and Ca, while leaf litter decomposition rates of non-nitrogen-fixing trees were only related to initial leaf litter Ca. Whereas specific leaf area was the best predictor of leaf litter decomposition rates among all the species. Therefore, our results revealed that both initial leaf litter traits and functional groups were predicting leaf litter decomposition rates.

AB Aim Maintenance of ecosystem function under climate change may depend on variation in the way species within functional guilds and individuals within species respond to changes in temperature. What level of variation among and within species do we need to understand, and is it predictable from distribution and trait data?
   Location Northern California, USA.
   Methods We used a mesocosm experiment and a set of feeding trials to test the ability of a guild of marine invertebrate grazers to control benthic algal blooms along a local temperature gradient. We investigate links between the locally disjunct distributions of these species, their temperature tolerance traits and the temperature dependence of their population growth and grazing rates.
   Results We found that the effect of increased temperature on population growth rates is independent of species interactions, but strongly species specific. This variation among herbivores is only partly predictable from differences in species distributions and traits, but translated into large differences in their ability to control macroalgae. Further, these species effects were amplified at warmer temperatures. Finally, we found evidence for a strong response to temperature in the feeding rates of the most important consumer over the course of the experiment, resulting in almost as much variation in grazing rates within one species as the average difference between species.
   Main conclusions These results illustrate the importance of understanding the variation in responses to temperature among species within a trophic level, among populations within key species and potentially within populations over time. However, this variation is not easily predicted. Further research is needed to uncover links between individuals' thermal optima and their current and future temperature niche.

AB Genomic selection for traits of economic importance is an emerging approach carrying tremendous potentials. Many of polygenic traits asmilk fat, protein and yield have been characterize at genomic level and important selection signatures have been identified. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are potential loci for affecting many of dairy capabilities. Present studywas conducted for genomic dissection of CYP11b1 gene in riverine buffaloes and seven genetic variations were identified. Out of these, one novel polymorphism (p.A313T) was found well associated with milk fat % age. AB genotyped buffaloes were found to have higher milk fat % age (8.9%) for this loci. p. A313T was further validated at larger data set by restriction digestion using CviAII enzyme. Functional consequences of this locus were also predicted by studying three dimensional structure of CYP11b1 protein. For this purpose, 3D protein model was predicted by homology modeling, secondary structural attributes were determined, signal peptide was predicted and a transmembrane helix was also identified. One of polymorphism (p.Y205L) was found in the vicinity of functionally significant F-G loop region, which is the part of protein gets attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane. But this variation could not be associated and needs further investigation. p. A30V, a popular selection marker in cattle, was found in buffaloes as well but could not be associated and might need further confirmation on larger data set. Results of this study illustrate the impending potential of this gene in determining dairy capabilities of buffaloes and might have a role in selection of superior dairy buffaloes.

AB Pine afforestation of grassland streams may lead to changes in species traits and therefore functional diversity of epilithic algal community. Here, we studied trait-based responses in three grassland and three afforested streams in a mountain watershed of Crdoba, Argentina. We hypothesized that afforestation would reduce functional diversity through a simplification of periphyton architecture resulting from reduction in light availability, and that changes in hydrological periods would influence community responses. Algal samples were collected at each stream during two different hydrological periods (high flow and low flow), and physicochemical variables were recorded. Selected traits included strategies and morphological characters related to resource access and disturbance resistance (size, morphological guild, resource requirement, attachment mechanism and life-form). We calculated two indices of functional diversity: Rao's quadratic entropy (FD (Q) ) and functional variance. Most trait categories showed a significant effect of one or both factors; 26 % discriminated between vegetation types, 26 % reflect the changes between hydrological periods, and 47 % were sensitive to both of them. Our results revealed some categories of traits that can be used to distinguish changes in riparian vegetation, such as unicellular life-form and high-profile guild. Functional diversity of single traits was affected differently by pine afforestation. However, the most integrative index, the FD (Q) mean, partially supported our hypotheses. Afforestation reduced FD (Q) mean by 50 %, but only during low-flow period. FD (Q) mean was high and similar between streams at high flow, when environmental factors, such as discharge and temperature, could prevail on differences in riparian vegetation.

AB Native benthic amphipods play a key role in freshwater ecosystem services such as leaf litter decomposition. The replacement of native by invasive species with different functional traits has the potential to alter hyporheic processes, communities, and food webs. Despite the increasing number of publications on invasive species, there is a lack of studies that compare the effects of native versus invasive amphipods on physico-chemical habitat properties and microbial communities in the substrate. We compared the effects of an indigenous (Gammarus roeseli, Gervais 1835) and an invasive (Dikerogammarus villosus, Sowinsky 1894) amphipod on leaf litter decomposition, as well as on bacterial communities and physico-chemical conditions in freshwater substrata. We hypothesized that the different amphipod species distinctly alter habitat conditions and microbial community composition, depending on functional differences in leaf litter decomposition. We detected strong differences between G. roeseli and D. villosus in the feeding rates on alder leaves, with 11-fold greater decomposition of alder leaves by the native species. Additionally, our study revealed differences in microbial community composition between treatments at the substrate surface, but almost no differences in physico-chemical parameters in the interstitial and open water. These results support the hypothesis that the replacement of indigenous amphipod species by functionally different invasive amphipods can lead to a decrease in leaf litter decomposition and an altered microbial community composition with possible effects on benthic food webs. These effects on ecosystem services should be taken into account when assessing the impacts of invasive species on freshwater habitats.

AB Functional diversity is among the main components of biodiversity, by quantifying the characteristics of organisms and by investigating which assembly processes prevail in the organisation of communities. The objective of this study was to assess the functional diversity of testate amoebae in floodplains, verifying whether the determinant assembly process of the community is related to environmental filters or the limiting similarity. We tested the hypothesis that the functional diversity of the testate amoebae would be lower than randomly expected in the hydrological periods, influenced by environmental filters. In addition, the functional diversity of the testate amoebae was expected to be strongly influenced by variables related to the productivity of the environments, since the food resources are the most important environmental factors in the assembly of testate amoeba communities. Sampling was carried out quarterly between 2002 and 2011 on the surface of the pelagic zone in six floodplain environments. Results showed that the values were lower than randomly expected according to the functional diversity indices. In addition, the functional diversity was predicted by the environmental variables related to the productivity of the environments according to multiple regression analyses. Our results highlight that functional diversity was mainly influenced by the environmental filters. The limiting similarity and neutral processes could not be totally discarded, and the three mechanisms of community assembly can occur. The environmental filters were linked to productivity and consequently to food resources, which are determinant in the assembly of the testate amoebae community, corroborating our predicted hypothesis.

AB Floods and droughts are predicted to increase in intensity, duration and frequency in many future climate scenarios, yet long-term data that track before-and-after responses of natural communities remain scarce. We explored the impacts of a series of extreme events, including a particularly catastrophic flood, over 13years in the Glenfinish River in Ireland.
   Overall, seasonal cycles of absolute and relative abundance were the strongest temporal signal in the data, and the community as a whole was relatively persistent. At interannual scales, a core of c.15 taxa were present throughout most of the time series, which spanned >10 generations for most taxa, whereas extreme events had negligible or weak effects, with two notable exceptions. The catastrophic 1986 summer flood triggered a 10-fold decline in abundance: although most populations returned to their pre-disturbance state in <3years, some took up to a decade to recover. In 1988-1989, two contrasting extreme low-rainfall and storm events occurred within a year and were associated with far more marked compositional and functional shifts than were seen in the 1986 flood, although abundance was not so strongly affected.
   Contrasting extreme events that occur close to one another in time and/or at atypical times of year (e.g. floods in summer, when base flow is low) can have particularly strong effects, whereas at other times even the most extreme events may leave little longer-term footprint. Therefore, both the temporal context and the magnitude of events determine the biota's response.
   Effects of the events also varied across taxa and organisational levels: the more r-selected taxa (e.g. Chironomidae) were relatively unaffected compared with the larger, more K-selected taxa. Community-level responses were mostly driven by shifts in relative abundances, rather than species loss or turnover, and the functional diversity of species traits was more resilient still. The apparent stability in relative abundances of functional groups in the face of significant variation at the species level is suggestive of high functional redundancy, but without exhaustive further analyses using null-model approaches, this remains unproved. In turn, relatively high levels of redundancy and the reshuffling of species with similar traits could confer resilience in the face of all but the most extreme events.

AB Genomic resources such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), insertions and deletions (InDels) and SSRs (simple sequence repeats) are essential for crop improvement and better utilization in genetic breeding. However, the resources for the sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) are still limited. In the present study, to dissect large-scale genomic molecular marker resources for sacred lotus, we re-sequenced a Thailand sacred lotus cultivar 'Chiang Mai wild lotus' and compared with the reported lotus genome 'Middle lake wild lotus'. A total of 3,180,059 SNPs, 328, 251 InDels and 14,191 SVs were found between the two genomes. The functional impact analyses of these SNPs indicated that they may be involved in metabolic processes, binding, catalytic activity, etc. Mining the genome sequences for SSRs showed that 191,657 SSRs were identified with a frequency of one SSR per 4.23 kb and 103,656 SSR primer pairs were designed. Furthermore, 14, 502 EST-SSRs were also indentified using the available RNA-seq data in the NCBI. A subset of 150 SSRs (genomic and EST-SSRs) was randomly selected for validation and genetic diversity analysis. The genotypes could be easily distinguished using these SSR markers and the 'Chiang Mai wild lotus' was obviously differentiated from the other Chinese accessions. This study provides considerable amounts of genomic resources and markers for the quantitative trait locus (QTL) identification and molecular selection of the species, which could have a potential role in various applications in sacred lotus breeding.

AB It is well known that predators can induce morphological changes in some fish: individuals exposed to predation cues increase body depth and the length of spines. We hypothesize that these structures may evolve synergistically, as together, these traits will further enlarge the body dimensions of the fish that gape-limited predators must overcome. We therefore expect that the orientation of the spines will predict which body dimension increases in the presence of predators. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we tested this prediction on the macroevolutionary scale across 347 teleost families, which display considerable variation in fin spines, body depth and width. Consistent with our predictions, we demonstrate that fin spines on the vertical plane (dorsal and anal fins) are associated with a deeper-bodied optimum. Lineages with spines on the horizontal plane (pectoral fins) are associated with a wider-bodied optimum. Optimal body dimensions across lineages without spines paralleling the body dimension match the allometric expectation. Additionally, lineages with longer spines have deeper and wider body dimensions. This evolutionary relationship between fin spines and body dimensions across teleosts reveals functional synergy between these two traits and a potential macroevolutionary signature of predation on the evolutionary dynamics of body shape.

AB We investigated the relationship between functional diversity and secondary production in an estuarine system subjected to anthropogenic impacts and climate events. Data consisted of a 14 yr long study of benthic invertebrate production from a seagrass bed and a sandflat. We used generalized linear models to test whether secondary production was explained by a functional identity effect (dominant traits in the community), by a complementarity effect (dissimilarity in trait measurements) or by their combined effects. From a priori correlations among community-weighted means for all traits, we identified 3 main life-history groups in the estuarine communities, reflecting different strategies to cope with disturbance and resulting in different production levels: species with an opportunist strategy, large slow-growing species and species with attributes providing higher competitive advantages, such as high mobility and omnivore feeding. The functional identity effect, also known as mass ratio hypothesis, was tested with a model combining these life-history groups. Overall, the functional identity/mass ratio effect model best explained variability in secondary production compared to the complementarity and combined effects models. In general, species with an opportunist strategy had higher production. These species ex plained a higher proportion of the production changes during the study period than the other 2 life-history groups. Nevertheless, this type of production, sustained by large numbers of small opportunist species with a rapid completion of their life cycle, may contribute towards an impoverishment of overall ecosystem functioning. In addition, we discuss the variation of all functional diversity measurements for the sites along the study period and relative to the changes in production.

AB Recent studies have renewed interest in sponge ecology by emphasizing the functional importance of sponges in a broad array of ecosystem services. Many critically important habitats occupied by sponges face chronic stressors that might lead to alterations in their diversity, relatedness, and functional attributes. We addressed whether proximity to human activity might be a significant factor in structuring sponge community composition, as well as potential functional roles, by monitoring sponge diversity and abundance at two structurally similar sites that vary in distance to areas of high coastal development in Bocas Del Toro, Panama. We surveyed sponge communities at each site using belt transects and differences between two sites were compared using the following variables: (1) sponge species richness, Shannon diversity, and inverse Simpson's diversity; (2) phylogenetic diversity; (3) taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity; (4) trait diversity and dissimilarity; and (5) phylogenetic and trait patterns in community structure. We observed significantly higher sponge diversity at Punta Caracol, the site most distant from human development (similar to 5 km). Although phylogenetic diversity was lower at Saigon Bay, the site adjacent to a large village including many houses, businesses, and an airport, the sites did not exhibit significantly different patterns of phylogenetic relatedness in species composition. However, each site had a distinct taxonomic and phylogenetic composition (beta diversity). In addition, the sponge community at Saigon included a higher relative abundance of sponges with high microbial abundance and high chlorophyll a concentration, whereas the community at Punta Caracol had a more even distribution of these traits, yielding a significant difference in functional trait diversity between sites. These results suggest that lower diversity and potentially altered community function might be associated with proximity to human populations. This study highlights the importance of evaluating functional traits and phylogenetic diversity in addition to common diversity metrics when assessing potential environmental impacts on benthic communities.

AB Higher-tier ecological risk assessment of chemicals often relies upon studies in dynamic and/or static mesocosms. Physico-chemical and hydrological properties of each type of mesocosm result in specific chemicals fate, community functioning, and potential recovery. In the present study, macroinvertebrate abundance- and biomass-weighted biological and ecological trait matrices were used to assess the effects of a dithiocarbamate fungicide, thiram (35 and 170 A mu g l(-1)), and of a petroleum middle distillate (0.01, 0.4, 2 and 20 mg l(-1)) in outdoor stream and pond mesocosms. Trait sensitivity was characterized using functional diversity indices and trait modality distributions to assess the influence of the type of experimental systems and the ability of traits to disentangle chemical-induced effects from temporal and stochastic variations. In addition, leaf litter breakdown was used as an integrative functional endpoint. Regardless to the substance, treatments had a direct effect on the functional structure of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in streams but not in ponds, suggesting that global functional responses to chemicals are system-specific. Although both substances had an effect in streams, differences were noticed in the nature of the affected traits suggesting that chemical mode of action plays a role in functional alterations. This was illustrated by the link between negative effects of chemical exposure on detritivorous taxa and reduced litter breakdown rate in streams. Therefore, characterisation of macroinvertebrate biological traits associated with the measurement of a functional process such as litter breakdown may provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects occurring in mesocosms exposed to organic chemicals.

AB In host-parasite relationships, parasite prevalence and abundance can vary over time, potentially impacting how hosts are affected by infection. Here, the pathology, growth, condition and diet of a juvenile Cyprinus carpio cohort infected with the non-native cestode Bothriocephalus acheilognathi was measured in October 2012 (end of their first summer of life), April 2013 (end of first winter) and October 2013 (end of second summer). Pathology revealed consistent impacts, including severe compression and architectural modification of the intestine. At the end of the first summer, there was no difference in lengths and condition of the infected and uninfected fish. However, at the end of the winter period, the condition of infected fish was significantly reduced and by the end of their second summer, the infected fish were significantly smaller and remained in significantly reduced condition. Their diets were significantly different over time; infected fish consumed significantly higher proportions of food items <53 mu m than uninfected individuals, a likely consequence of impaired functional traits due to infection. Thus, the sub-lethal impacts of this parasite, namely changes in histopathology, growth and trophic niche were dependent on time and/or age of the fish.

AB Resources structure ecological communities and potentially link biodiversity to energy flow. It is commonly believed that functional traits (generalists versus specialists) involved in the exploitation of resources depend on resource availability and environmental fluctuations. The longitudinal nature of stream ecosystems provides changing resources to stream biota with yet unknown effects on microbial functional traits and community structure. We investigated the impact of autochthonous (algal extract) and allochthonous (spruce extract) resources, as they change along alpine streams from above to below the treeline, on microbial diversity, community composition and functions of benthic biofilms. Combining bromodeoxyuridine labelling and 454 pyrosequencing, we showed that diversity was lower upstream than downstream of the treeline and that community composition changed along the altitudinal gradient. We also found that, especially for allochthonous resources, specialisation by biofilm bacteria increased along that same gradient. Our results suggest that in streams below the treeline biofilm diversity, specialisation and functioning are associated with increasing niche differentiation as potentially modulated by divers allochthonous and autochthonous constituents contributing to resources. These findings expand our current understanding on biofilm structure and function in alpine streams.

AB Unregulated river systems are organized in a hierarchy in which large-scale factors (i.e., landscape and segment scales) influence local habitats (i.e., reach, meso-, and microhabitat scales), and both differentially exert selective pressures on biota. Dams, however, create discontinua in these processes and change the hierarchical structure. We examined the relative roles of hydrology and other instream factors, within a hierarchical landscape context, in organizing fish communities in regulated and unregulated tributaries to the Upper Tennessee River, USA. We used multivariate regression trees to identify factors that partition fish assemblages based on trait similarities, irrespective of spatial scale. We then used classical path analysis and structural equation modeling to evaluate the most plausible hierarchical causal structure of specific trait-based community components, given the data. Both statistical approaches suggested that river regulation affects stream fishes through a variety of reach-scale variables, not always through hydrology itself. Although we observed different changes in flow, temperature, and biotic responses according to regulation types, the most predominant path in which dam regulation affected biota was via temperature alterations. Diversion dams had the strongest effects on fish assemblages. Diversion dams reduced flow magnitudes, leading to declines in fish richness but increased temperatures, leading to lower abundances in equilibrium species and nest guarders. Peaking and run-of-river dams increased flow variability, leading to lower abundances in nest-guarding fishes. Flow displayed direct relationships with biotic responses; however, results indicated that changes in temperature and substrate had equal, if not stronger, effects on fish assemblage composition. The strength and nature of relationships depended on whether flow metrics were standardized for river size. We suggest that restoration efforts in regulated rivers focus on improving flow conditions in conjunction with temperature and substrate restoration.

AB Riverine wetlands provide important habitats and travel corridors for resident and transient species, playing a key role in maintaining the diversity of entire landscapes. This paper assessed a long-term (1990-2013) landscape changes and avifauna community dynamics in the Yellow River wetland natural reserves, China. Remote sensing information was combined with field surveys to collect critical data on land use and avifaunal populations. The results reveal that land use has dramatic changes during 1990-2013. Utilized water features have significantly decreased over 20 years, whereas artificial land features such as paddy, dry field and built-up area have shown a steady increasing trend in the three riverine wetlands. The spatial landscape patterns of the three wetlands have become fragmented and notably heterogeneous as results of rapid economic development. With the changes of utilized water features, avifauna data show that some overwintering and transient species are becoming permanent residents. Though there is an abundant and diverse array of bird species utilizing the wetlands, migrating traits of these avifauna species have changed. This study can provide basic information for making effective and sustainable conservation plans for the entire Yellow River wetland natural reserves. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge of plant community structure and how it can confer resistance to climate change effects is required for the management of fluvial ecosystems. Findings from such studies can be applied in decision making processes to implement measures to maintain, conserve or improve fluvial quality. Floristic and environmental data from 100 sample stations located in three River Basin Districts in northern Portugal were gathered as part of the 2010 Water Framework Directive monitoring program carried out on mainland Portugal. Three habitat types were characterized based on the flow dynamic level: the wetted channel, the bankfull area and the riparian gallery. Hierarchical cluster analysis of environmental data revealed three distinct environmental groups of sites. Floristic data were organized by these environmental groups characterized by altitudinal, temperature and precipitation data variables. The combination of taxonomic diversity and species frequency reflect functional differences for these habitats, here explained by a resistance and resilience approach. More low-frequency species and higher levels of functional diversity occurred at stations with more variable environmental conditions. Predictive modelling of the future distribution of the three environmental groups under two different climate scenarios supported the relevance of low-frequency traits in conferring resistance to climatic change effects.

AB A long-term field experiment was run for 12 years to evaluate the impact of minimum tillage (MT) compared to conventional mouldboard ploughing (CT) on soil chemical, physical and microbial properties in a shallow Cambisol formed over fluvioglacial deposits of Drava river in Slovenia. Significant differences between MT and CT were found in vertical distribution of soil organic C (SOC) and nutrients (total N and plant available potassium); under MT, concentrations decreased from the soil surface to the lower layers, as opposed to CT which maintained rather uniform distribution down to the ploughing depth. MT in comparison with CT also increased the proportion of water-stable 2-4-mm-sized aggregates (80.9 and 61.3 %, respectively), water holding capacity (24.8 and 22.2 %, respectively) and plant available water (13.4 and 10.3 %, respectively) in the upper 0-10-cm soil layer. Bulk density, porosity, the proportion of water-stable 1-2-mm-sized aggregates and infiltration rate showed no significant differences between the tillage treatments. SOC content in the upper 0-10-cm soil layer was not significantly different between MT and CT (1.60 +/- 0.07 and 1.45 +/- 0.05 %, respectively), as well as the overall stock in the investigated soil profile (0-60 cm) remained unaffected (57.4 +/- 0.8 and 59.1 +/- 2.2 t ha(-1), respectively). Microbial biomass, estimated by the total soil DNA, was higher in MT than CT in the 0-10-cm layer. Furthermore, a positive linear dependence of microbial biomass on SOC content was observed. Fingerprinting of bacterial, fungal and archaeal communities indicated that microbial community composition changed by long-term MT, whereas changes in microbial diversity were not detected for any domain. The most pronounced shifts in the composition were found for bacterial communities in the 10-20-cm layer, while the composition of fungal communities slightly changed in the upper 0-10 cm of MT soil. The composition of archaeal communities was not affected by the tillage or by the soil depth. Our results indicate that MT generates modest changes in soil structure and soil water retention properties and could support measures against erosion, drought and nutrient leaching. Considering increased microbial biomass in the topsoil of MT and shifts in microbial diversity, the impacts of MT on soil microbiome are also evident and need to be further investigated to identify the affected functional traits.

AB Carbon uptake in terrestrial plants functions under near-constant source carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and isotopic ratios, but aquatic macrophytes operate in a more complex system where environmental fluxes and biotic interactions undermine assumptions of constant CO2 concentration and C-13/C-12.
   Many marine macrophytes not only passively access CO2 for photosynthesis, but also actively concentrate CO2 and bicarbonate (HCO3-) using carbon concentration mechanisms (CCMs). These processes change macrophyte carbon fractionation signatures (C-13/C-12) and elevate seawater pH as high as 10.4 in mesocosm pH assays, in which the pH value reached is termed pH*.
   I assembled a global data set of 2027 marine macrophyte C-13 and pH assay values for 664 species to assess (i) how macrophyte C-13 varies with the abiotic parameters such as sea surface temperature (SST), latitude and habitat, and the organismal traits of taxonomic and functional group membership and (ii) how species C-13 is related to CCM presence or absence, as determined by a pH drift assay.
   Across 613 macrophyte species, collection site distance from the equator was negatively related to species C-13, while collection site variance in SST was positively related to species C-13. Macrophyte tissue C-13 differed among oceans as well as in intertidal versus subtidal habitats. Species from phylum Rhodophyta had the lowest C-13, and functional group was related to C-13, largely due to higher C-13 in calcifying species.
   Analysis of 141 species with paired pH*-C-13 data found that these metrics of CCM presence are not independent. As species C-13 increases so does the probability of species pH*>9.0, a threshold value of CCM presence in pH assays.
   Synthesis. CCMs revealed species patterns in communities at every scale investigated, from local emersion gradients to oceanic and global gradients. Trends in macrophyte C-13 values indicate that macrophytes rely more on CO2 further from the equator, but have increased use of HCO3- at sites with high temperature variance, patterns that may be driven by species turnover rather than intraspecific variation. Patterns in species CCMs will be crucial to understanding how macrophyte communities respond to ocean acidification-induced changes to SST and variability.

AB A decapod crustacean model is needed for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying physiological processes, such as reproduction, sex determination, molting and growth, immunity, regeneration, and response to stress. Criteria for selection are: life-history traits, adult size, availability and ease of culture, and genomics and genetic manipulation. Three freshwater species are considered: cherry shrimp, Neocaridina denticulata; red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii; and redclaw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus. All three are readily available, reproduce year round, and grow rapidly. The crayfish species require more space for culture than does N. denticulata. The transparent cuticle of cherry shrimp provides for direct assessment of reproductive status, stage of molt, and tissue-specific expression of reporter genes, and facilitates screening of mutations affecting phenotype. Moreover, a preliminary genome of N. denticulata is available and efforts toward complete genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing have been initiated. Neocaridina denticulata possesses the best combination of traits that make it most suitable as a model for functional genomics. The next step is to obtain the complete genome sequence and to develop molecular technologies for the screening of mutants and for manipulating tissue-specific gene expression.

AB Aim The drivers of phylogenetic beta diversity include both local processes (e.g. environmental filtering) and regional processes (e.g. dispersal limitation). The role of environmental filtering can be investigated more directly by analysing community-environment associations, but dispersal limitation is one of the most challenging processes to examine. We investigated the role of traits related to dispersal - flight capacity, body size and voltinism - as drivers ofphylogenetic distance decay relationships in Neotropical stream insect communities.
   Location Headwater streams spread over 600km in south-eastern Brazil.
   Methods We compiled a data set of aquatic insect communities inhabiting streams across the State of SAo Paulo (Brazil). Then, we investigated environmental and spatial signals on phylobetadiversity patterns of aquatic insects using Mantel tests, multiple regressions on distance matrices and variation partitioning. We employed null models to investigate whether phylogenetic distance decay differed from pure compositional distance decay. We deconstructed the data set based on dispersal-related traits; we then ran distance decay analyses for these subsets separately.
   Results Geographical distance, rather than environmental distance, better explained the patterns of phylobetadiversity. We found that the phylogenetic decay relationship differed from the relationship expected for the null models only for univoltine, large-bodied genera with a high-flight capacity.
   Main conclusions Dispersal limitation, rather than species sorting, was the main driver for phylogenetic beta diversity in the metacommunity that we studied. We suggest that life-history strategies and mainly voltinism drive the distance decay of similarity in the insect communities examined. We additionally discuss the role of dispersal events over time to explain differences in distance decay patterns among tropical and other regions.

AB Emphasizing species' trait similarities over differences, functional feeding guilds underrepresent functional diversity within stream communities. Species within guilds commonly overlap in their distributions and must partition their shared resources to coexist. Guild partitioning strategies may be revealed by the dissimilar responses the species show to environmental conditions, and these responses may be predicted from species-specific traits. To test this, I examined a grazer guild in a mountain stream dominated by three mayflies, Baetis, Epeorus, and Cinygmula. My objective was to determine how these species responded to gradients of current velocity, stream depth, and rock size and the abundance of algal food. I sampled 35 streambed locations and measured near-bed current velocity and depth at nine points at each location before sampling macroinvertebrates with a Surber sampler. Nine of the sampled rocks were measured for size, and benthic algae were collected from four of them. Multiple regression and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that each mayfly had unique responses to current velocity, depth, rock size, and algal abundance. Baetis correlated with depth, current velocity, and the interaction of these variables. Epeorus correlated exclusively with current velocity, and Cinygmula correlated with depth in interaction with other variables. Algal abundance by itself was a poor predictor of mayfly abundance, and NMDS indicated that individual species responses were not good predictors of mayfly assemblage patterns. Nevertheless, the mayflies' idiosyncratic responses to current velocity, depth, and rock size supported the notion that these variables are components of unique partitioning strategies.

AB The introduction of exotic species and the extirpation of native species that occurred during the past two centuries have strongly modified the structure of most plant and animal assemblages across the globe. Such a biotic change is particularly marked in isolated environments such as islands or isolated lakes. Most studies reported drastic changes between before and after human disturbances, but the dynamics of change in assemblage structure through the invasion and extirpation processes are rarely reported. Here we measured the aquatic ecosystem degradation through exotic species introduction and native species extirpation experienced by Lake Erhai (China) during the last 50 years using structural, functional and taxonomic distinctness biodiversity indices. Structural diversity (species richness) did not varied monotonically along the temporal gradient, due to an opposite trend between exotic species increase and a concomitant decline of native species richness. Functional diversity displayed unclear ascending trends driven by the introduction of exotic species having distinct functional traits than natives. Taxonomic distinctness indices exhibited an increase of the average taxonomic distinctness (Delta(+)), but a decrease of the variation in taxonomic distinctness (Lambda(+)) through time. Structural, functional and distinctness indices providing complementary information on ecosystem degradation, we here proposed a new multifaceted degradation index integrating these three facets of biodiversity. Such an index provided an accurate representation of the faunistic changes experienced by Lake Erhai and might constitute a comprehensive way to measure ecosystem degradation through exotic fish species introductions and native fish species extirpations.

AB Morphological approaches have been used extensively to understand assembly rules (species interactions, environmental filtering, and neutral processes) that structure ecological communities. Desert anurans cope with limited water by either being restricted to permanent water or becoming more fossorial, which should be reflected in their morphology. We examined morphological diversity of 16 frog species across six habitat types within the Chihuahuan Desert to investigate the relationship between species richness and morphological space. We measured 13 morphological traits associated with locomotion, habitat use, and feeding. Principal components analysis separated species into three ecomorphological groups: fossorial, terrestrial, and semi-aquatic species. Morphological diversity was analyzed and compared against a null model and revealed nonrandom community structure. The total assemblage morphospace increased in relation to species richness, though this relationship was not significant. Species were significantly packed within the morphospace exhibiting high morphological similarity while being less evenly dispersed, with increasing species richness, indicative of a response to an environmental gradient. Given the highly xeric nature of the Chihuahuan Desert, our results support the assumption that environmental filtering, rather than interspecific interactions, shapes assemblages' structure by favoring species with similar traits to co-occur more often within a given habitat type than expected by chance.

AB Background: Asian buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) have an important socio-economic role. The majority of the population is situated in developing countries. Due to the scarce resources in these countries, very few species-specific biotechnology tools exist and a lot of cattle-derived technologies are applied to buffaloes. However, the application of cattle genomic tools to buffaloes is not straightforward and, as results suggested, despite genome sequences similarity the genetic polymorphisms are different.
   Results: The first SNP chip genotyping platform designed specifically for buffaloes has recently become available. Herein, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene network analysis carried out in buffaloes is presented. Target phenotypes were six milk production and four reproductive traits. GWAS identified SNP with significant associations and suggested candidate genes that were specific to each trait and also genes with pleiotropic effect, associated to multiple traits.
   Conclusions: Network predictions of interactions between these candidate genes may guide further molecular analyses in search of disruptive mutations, help select genes for functional experiments and evidence metabolism differences in comparison to cattle. The cattle SNP chip does not offer an optimal coverage of buffalo genome, thereafter the development of new buffalo-specific genetic technologies is warranted. An annotated reference genome would greatly facilitate genetic research, with potential impact to buffalo-based dairy production.

AB Identifying resource use and functional traits of non-indigenous species are promising means to increase the ability to predict ecological consequences of invasions. One of the most widely spread brachyuran crab species, and a recent invader in the northern Baltic Sea, is the North American Harris mud crab, Rhithropanopeus harrisii (Gould, 1841). Although spread, establishment, and population structure have been studied for this species, little is known about its role and impact in a new environment. We investigated the position and role of R. harrisii in the coastal food web by combining spatial and temporal estimates of trophic position using stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15), with short-term food-and habitat-choice experiments. We observed a stable pattern in the trophic position between two environmentally different locations in the Archipelago Sea over the production season. The identification of a natural breakpoint in carbon stable isotopes at the size of 12 mm carapace width suggested a presence of an ontogenetic diet shift, which was confirmed by isotope signatures positioning large R. harrisii among secondary consumers and small individuals with primary consumers. The generalist consumer nature of R. harrisii and preference for structured habitat was supported by an active habitat and food choice, revealing no preference for prey species (polychaetes versus amphipod), but selection of brown algae over bare mud. To broaden the understanding of the functional role of R. harrisii, we combined our findings with other known biological and ecological traits of the species and qualitatively compared these to characteristics of other benthic organisms in the northern Baltic Sea, suggesting a general similarity in traits.

AB 1. Charophytes are benthic macroalgae that live in fresh and brackish waters. Given the historic deterioration of their habitats and their competitive inferiority relative to tall rooted plants under eutrophic conditions, it is hypothesized that charophytes are among the most threatened autotrophs. Also, it is expected that charophytes with generalist niches and functional traits, such as tolerance of a broad salinity range and large height, should thrive owing to available habitats and stronger competitive ability.
   2. These hypotheses were tested comparing the rarity of charophytes in the Nordic countries with other autotrophs and analysing the relationship to species niche specialization and functional traits. A value on a rarity-commonness scale was assigned to each species based on their Red List status. Niche specialization was evaluated by the Outlying Mean Index using a large Danish dataset while traits were derived from the literature.
   3. Supporting the hypotheses, 50-87% of charophyte species were Red Listed, which is much greater than for vascular aquatic (30-35%) and terrestrial plants (18-28%). Commonness of charophytes decreased significantly with niche specialization in separate analyses of brackish and freshwater sites. For brackish water species, the most influential parameter determining species distribution was salinity while for freshwater species, alkalinity, lake size and chlorophyll concentration played a major role. Four functional traits: shoot height, salinity tolerance, bulbil production and flexible life cycle duration were significantly positively related to commonness.
   4. In conclusion, charophytes contain a larger fraction of threatened species compared with other groups of autotrophs. The few common charophytes are generalists tolerant of a wide range of conditions, while specialists often have short stature, restricted life cycle variability and are rare in the disturbed contemporary landscape. It is thus a conservation priority to delineate accurately the environmental conditions preferred by the threatened species and protect or restore proper habitats.

AB Across landscapes, riparian plant communities assemble under varying levels of disturbance, environmental stress, and resource availability, leading to the development of distinct riparian life-history guilds over evolutionary timescales. Identifying the environmental filters that exert selective pressures on specific riparian vegetation guilds is a critical step in setting baseline expectations for how riparian vegetation may respond to environmental conditions anticipated under future global change scenarios. In this study, we ask: (1) What riparian plant guilds exist across the interior Columbia and upper Missouri River basins? (2) What environmental filters shape riparian guild distributions? (3) How does resource partitioning among guilds influence guild distributions and co-occurrence? Woody species composition was measured at 703 stream reaches and each species' morphological and functional attributes were extracted from a database in four categories: (1) life form, (2) persistence and growth, (3) reproduction, and (4) resource use. We clustered species into guilds by morphological characteristics and attributes related to environmental tolerances, modeling these guilds' distributions as a function of environmental filters-regional climate, watershed hydrogeomorphic characteristics, and stream channel form-and guild coexistence. We identified five guilds: (1) a tall, deeply rooted, long-lived, evergreen tree guild, (2) a xeric, disturbance tolerant shrub guild, (3) a hydrophytic, thicket-forming shrub guild, (4) a low-statured, shade-tolerant, understory shrub guild, and (5) a flood tolerant, mesoriparian shrub guild. Guilds were most strongly discriminated by species' rooting depth, canopy height and potential to resprout and grow following biomass-removing disturbance (e.g., flooding, fire). Hydro-climatic variables, including precipitation, watershed area, water table depth, and channel form attributes reflective of hydrologic regime, were predictors of guilds whose life history strategies had affinity or aversion to flooding, drought, and fluvial disturbance. Biotic interactions excluded guilds with divergent life history strategies and/or allowed for the co-occurrence of guilds that partition resources differently in the same environment. We conclude that the riparian guild framework provides insight into how disturbance and bioclimatic gradients shape riparian functional plant diversity across heterogeneous landscapes. Multiple environmental filters should be considered when the riparian response guild framework is to be used as a decision-support tool framework across large spatial extents.

AB Anthropogenic land-cover change is driving biodiversity loss worldwide. At the epicenter of this crisis lies Southeast Asia, where biodiversity-rich forests are being converted to oil-palm monocultures. As demand for palm oil increases, there is an urgent need to find strategies that maintain biodiversity in plantations. Previous studies found that retaining forest patches within plantations benefited some terrestrial taxa but not others. However, no study has focused on aquatic taxa such as fishes, despite their importance to human well-being. We assessed the efficacy of forested riparian reserves in conserving freshwater fish biodiversity in oil-palm monoculture by sampling stream fish communities in an oil-palm plantation in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Forested riparian reserves maintained preconversion local fish species richness and functional diversity. In contrast, local and total species richness, biomass, and functional diversity declined markedly in streams without riparian reserves. Mechanistically, riparian reserves appeared to increase local species richness by increasing leaf litter cover and maintaining coarse substrate. The loss of fishes specializing in leaf litter and coarse substrate decreased functional diversity and altered community composition in oil-palm plantation streams that lacked riparian reserves. Thus, a land-sharing strategy that incorporates the retention of forested riparian reserves may maintain the ecological integrity of fish communities in oil-palm plantations. We urge policymakers and growers to make retention of riparian reserves in oil-palm plantations standard practice, and we encourage palm-oil purchasers to source only palm oil from plantations that employ this practice.

AB 1. With the use of stable isotopes, new concepts have emerged based on the idea that the ecological niche can be approximated by the isotopic niche defined as a -space area with isotopic values as coordinates. This study aims to (i) redefine functional indices originally based on quantitative biological traits of species and demonstrate the ecological significance of newly defined isotopic functional indices (IFI) in a -isotopic space, (ii) compare IFI using biomass data with existing unweighted isotopic indices using only isotopic compositions.
   2. Using a community-wide approach, we tested IFI using isotopic compositions of a large set of associated species from two marine benthic communities widely reported in coastal shallow waters: the common Amphiura filiformis muddy-sand community and the engineered Haploops nirae sandy-mud community. Biomass and isotopic composition (C-13 and N-15) of all species were measured during four seasons.
   3. IFI were calculated in the isotopic space defined by the two communities, and variations were analysed: (i) isotopic functional richness indices measure the overall extent of the community trophic niche. They are higher in the Haploops community due to a higher diversity in food sources but also to longer food chains. (ii) isotopic functional evenness indices quantify the regularity in species distribution and the density in species packing. They showed that the biomass is concentrated at the edges of the food web in the Haploops community, outside the isotopic range of the main food source. (iii) isotopic functional divergence indices quantify the degree to which species distribution maximizes the divergence. They showed a larger utilization of secondary food sources in the Haploops community.
   4. The IFI variations responded according to expectations overall, based on the extensive knowledge of those communities. Results highlighted that IFI weighted with species biomass provide new insights into how the structure of energy accumulation as biomass between species is likely to underpin community structure and the interplay between structural components of richness, diversity and evenness of biomass distribution.

AB Trait-based approaches can reveal the mechanisms through which disturbances or stress impact communities, allowing comparisons of the role of different mechanisms in shaping communities among taxonomic groups. Such information can lead to higher comparability, transferability and predictability of the outcome of restoration projects. However, multitaxa trait-based approaches were rarely used in the context of ecosystem restoration. We investigated the responses to environmental gradients of seven taxa (vascular plants, staphylinid and carabid beetles, spiders, isopods, diplopods and earthworms) in a restored floodplain using a species traits approach. We assessed the impact of flood disturbances and soil hydric stress on the functional diversity (FD) and community-weighted mean (CWM) response of traits for each taxon. Ordination of hydrological variables revealed two main gradients. The first was related to the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood disturbances and the second to the average changes in soil hydric conditions. The analysis of CWM revealed that larger, poorly mobile species with narrow ecological tolerances were filtered by regular floods and/or changes in soil hydric conditions. Functional diversity patterns differed between the two gradients: decreasing with increasing flood disturbance, but increasing along the soil hydric stress gradient. This suggests that the mechanisms shaping community composition differ between the two gradients with environmental filtering being dominant with increasing flood disturbances and competition decreasing with more soil hydric stress.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the impact of restored flood disturbances and soil hydric stress on plant and invertebrate functional diversity and community-weighted mean can be positive, negative or more complex depending on the taxonomic group and environmental gradient considered. The patterns can to some extent be explained by the specific characteristics of each group. Larger, poorly mobile species with narrow ecological tolerances were particularly vulnerable to changes in disturbance and stress regime following floodplain restoration. These species may therefore be lost in the initial phases of restoration projects, but other more characteristic species of dynamic floodplains will be favoured. Understanding the consequences of these contrasted responses for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem functioning constitutes the next challenge for ecosystem restoration.

AB AimTo understand how environmental conditions and landscape structure interact at different spatial scales to shape the community composition of arid zone aquatic invertebrates with different dispersal abilities.
   LocationAustralia.
   MethodsFor each of five drainage basins and for their encompassing region (Pilbara), we built matrices of dissimilarities in presence-absence patterns of aquatic invertebrate community composition. This was carried out for all taxa collectively and separately for five dispersal trait groups: obligate aquatics, passive aerial dispersers, animals moving by aerial phoresy, weak and strong fliers. We analysed correlations between community dissimilarities and (1) dissimilarities in local environmental conditions, (2) geographic distances and (3) landscape resistance distances among the sites from which invertebrates were sampled. Calculation of landscape resistances accounted for longitudinal connectivity along the river channels (least-cost-path), lateral connectivity between streams and the potential effects of rugged topography on invertebrate dispersal.
   ResultsLocal environmental factors and landscape resistances explained differences in community composition at the regional scale. In basins with complex topography, local environmental conditions were the main factor explaining community dissimilarities in most dispersal groups. Conversely, in basins where flatter topography meant that moderate to high lateral connectivity between streams is possible, the spatial configuration of the dendritic network determined the community composition of most dispersal trait groups. Geographic and least-cost-path distances were poor predictors of community composition. None of the groups showed a consistent correlation with environmental factors alone, or just landscape resistances, across all basins.
   Main conclusionsLocal environmental conditions, hydrological connectivity and landscape resistance to dispersal are all important influences on community composition of arid zone aquatic invertebrates. The impact of each of these factors varies with dispersal trait group and spatial configuration of basins: the importance of lateral connectivity for explaining a substantial proportion of community composition points to a major role of flooding regimes in maintaining biological communities.

AB We examined the recovery of a fish assemblage following the catastrophic spill of highly alkaline (pH similar to 13) red sludge into a lowland river (i) to characterize taxonomic- and trait-based colonization of fishes in the river in the first 3 years of the recovery and (ii) to determine which structural-and trait-based variables best predicted colonization. Species richness showed comparable values to pre-disturbance state < 1 year after the spill. We found only moderate changes in the dominance of the most abundant species between pre- and post-disturbance periods, and consistent changes in the relative abundance of some rare species during the post-disturbance period. Frequency of occurrence (%) of the fishes in the watershed and their relative abundance (%) proved to be the most important predictor variables in colonization, whereas trait-based variables had a less important role. Our study about one of the largest scale and most serious documented fish kill shows that both taxonomic- and trait-based structure of fish assemblages can regenerate remarkably fast in a modified river and also shows that unfortunate chemical spills provide insights into the assembly of stream fish assemblages.

AB Urbanization is a globally process studied and considered one of the most drastic environmental disturb on biodiversity. This study aimed to evaluate how different intensities of urbanization act in the structure of birds in a medium size city inserted in a wetland area. In addition to the traditional metrics richness, abundance and taxonomic composition, it was found as the functional diversity and redundancy of birds are influenced by urban gradient. The urban area studied was the Pelotas city (31 degrees 46"S, 52 degrees 20"W) situated at the southernmost part of Brazil in a humid region of Pampa biome. A total of 216 fixed observation points along an urbanization gradient were used to sample the avifauna and four independent variables: number of trees, number of buildings with two or more floors, presence of aquatic habitat, and presence of open habitat. Functional traits of species characterized the biomass, diet, forage substrate and nesting substrate. The richness, abundance and functional diversity of avifauna were negatively related to the increase of urban intensity while the redundancy, different from the expected, did not respond to the urban gradient. The traits related to the areas with more intense urbanization (building with two or more floors) were: preference for foraging in the air, omnivory and cavity nesting. Areas with less intense urbanization (more trees and open habitats) were related to the preference for nesting on vegetation and in lower sites, and carnivory. The study showed the importance of the presence of open and aquatic habitats for the avifauna, landscape features typically not cited in urban studies, which highlight the need to adequate the mitigation actions for conservation efforts inside urban habitats according to the regional pool of species.

AB We provide an inventory of the sites and vegetation types in the Czech Republic and Slovakia that contain the highest numbers of vascular plant species in small areas of up to 625 m(2). The highest numbers of species were recorded in semi-natural grasslands, in which we report four new world records for fine-scale species richness: 17 species of vascular plants in 0.0044 m(2) in a mountain meadow in the Krkonose Mts, 52 and 63 species in 0.25 and 0.5 m(2), respectively, in the Kopanecke luky meadows in the Slovak Paradise (Slovensky raj), and 109 species in 16 m2 in the Porazky meadows in the White Carpathians (Bile Karpaty). The previous world record of 43 species in 0.1 m(2) was equalled in the Certoryje meadows in the White Carpathians, however, the previous record referred to shoot presence while the new record considers only the species rooted in the plot. We interpreted and corrected the data from the Czech Republic that Wilson et al. (2012) used to compile a list of world records and provide an updated list. The updated list contains five world records from the Czech Republic and two from Slovakia. The most species-rich grasslands and forests in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are concentrated in regions with base-rich soils in the Western Carpathians, especially in the flysch zone in SE Moravia and the Czech-Slovak borderland, and in limestone and volcanic areas in central Slovakia. The richest types of non-forest vegetation include semi-dry base-rich meadows (Bromion erecti and Cirsio-Brachypodion pinnati), base-rich pastures and mesic meadows (Cynosurion cristati and Arrhenatherion elatioris), Nardus stricta grasslands (Violion caninae and Nardo strictae-Agrostion minds) and some wet meadows and natural subalpine grasslands. A special type of species-rich herbaceous to open woodland vegetation develops as successional stages on gravel accumulations in Carpathian rivers after severe flooding. The maximum counts of vascular plant species in non-forest vegetation in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are 7 species/0.0009 m(2), 11/0.0011 m(2), 12/0.004 m(2), 17/0.0044 m(2), 23/0.01 m(2), 37/0.04 m(2), 43/0.1 m(2), 52/0.25 m(2), 63/0.5 m(2), 82/1 m(2), 88/4 m(2), 109/16 m(2), 116/25 m(2), 131/49 m(2) and 133/100 m(2). While the maximum counts for plots smaller than 0.5 m(2) are from various regions and probably mainly depend on appropriate management, the maximum counts for plots larger than 0.5 m(2) are for two areas only, the south-eastern part of the White Carpathians and Kopanecke hilcy meadows, suggesting the importance of regionally specific landscape processes for high species richness at such scales. Czech and Slovak forest vegetation is much poorer than grasslands, reaching maxima of 100, 109 and 118 species in plots of 100,400 and 500 m2, which are considerably smaller than global maxima for temperate forests. Most of the species-rich sites occur on base-rich soils, in habitats with intermediate values of environmental factors, are subject to low-intensity management or natural disturbance, occur in landscapes with large areas of natural and semi-natural vegetation and probably have a long historical continuity.

AB To understand the consequences of changes in diversity we need to consider the functional characteristics (traits) of species, as well as the trophic setting the taxa are part of. These two approaches have rarely been conducted in an integrated manner, although we know that trophic structure is an important driver of community functioning, and that biological traits, in particular body size, in turn determine which species interact. In this study, we assessed how structural food-web attributes (nestedness, generality, vulnerability) relate to multiple biological traits of interacting taxa. We found that the inherent complexity of a shallow subtidal trophic network of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish in the northern Baltic Sea contained identifiable and specific patterns: the feeding interactions were highly nested, both in terms of prey taxonomy and biological traits, suggesting trophic redundancy rather than trophic complementarity. Both trait diversity and trait redundancy of interacting species increased as a function of predator generality and prey vulnerability. These central food-web metrics, predator generality and prey vulnerability, were dependent on body size, which emerged as a fundamental trait. Body size, environmental habitat and body design were the relatively most important prey traits distinguishing between diets of smaller vs. larger predators, revealing morphological and spatial dimensions of predator trophic niches in the study community. We suggest continued development of an approach integrating functional diversity with the food web to effectively assess community structure, function and species interactions, and ultimately identify ecological impacts in communities undergoing environmental change in the Anthropocene.

AB Meiofauna and macrofauna are closely linked by numerous types of interactions, but comparative studies are rare. It has been postulated that meiofauna and macrofauna diversities are related, and that a higher functional diversity of meiobenthic and/or macrobenthic organisms can enhance a higher functional diversity. A simultaneous study of the deep Mediterranean sea meiobenthic and macrobenthic communities was conducted, from the west to central-eastern basin and from 1,200 to 2,700 m depth. We posed the following questions: 1) are meiofauna and macrofauna diversities related? 2) Does a higher diversity enhance a higher functional diversity? and 3) Does the relationship between diversity and functional diversity change considering different benthic size classes and taxa? In order to answer to our questions, the biodiversity and functional diversity of meiofauna and macrofauna were analysed, with a focus on three target groups: meiobenthic nematodes, macrobenthic nematodes and polychaetes. Meiobenthic nematodes and macrofaunal diversity appeared to be related only in terms of turnover diversity. A cross-taxon analysis on macrobenthic nematode and polychaete diversity and meiofauna diversity revealed a positive relationship in all cases that were studied. Considering functional diversity, many relationships emerged between the two benthic components. A higher meiobenthic nematode diversity did not enhance a higher functional diversity. A higher macrofauna diversity enhanced a higher functional diversity, but not for all macrobenthic taxa (i.e., nematodes). We can conclude that the diversity-functional diversity relationship changed across different size classes, even when the same taxon was considered. The diversity-functional diversity relationship changed across taxa even if they belonged to the same size class.

AB The question whether and how diversity-mediated productivity at the base of food-webs influences adjacent trophic levels is still unclear. Experiments revealed negative effects on consumers due to the increasing dominance of inedible species under grazing pressure, and positive effects due to a greater variety of prey resources. We experimentally investigate two more hypotheses, which have not been addressed in detail so far: first, more diverse primary producer communities potentially use limiting resources more efficiently, and are, therefore, more productive. This effect can be considered functionally similar to a direct enrichment with limiting resources, potentially resulting in a higher stochastic risk of herbivore extinction (paradox of enrichment'). Second, in a stable environment, enclosed primary producer communities should evolve towards a climax state', eventually dominated by one or few prey species. Therefore, long-term diversity effects in producer communities should more likely result from the specific traits of the dominating species, than from complementarity. To address these hypotheses, we conducted long-term laboratory experiments, exposing the freshwater grazer Daphnia magna to a gradient of algal species richness (1, 2, 4 or 8 edible chlorophyte species). The experiments were run in batch cultures, without exchange of growth medium after the start of the experiment. Six parameters related to Daphnia population demography, biomass accrual, and stability were followed and determined over a period of up to 263 days. Producer diversity exhibited strong positive effects on the short-term performance of grazers (first reproduction, first population peak), and on grazer mean standing stocks. However, herbivore long-term dynamics (day of extinction and temporal stability) depended on prey species identity, namely the presence of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our experiments suggest that both prey diversity and identity can have positive effects on consumer performance, but act on different time scales.

AB Blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are recurrent phenomena in marine and freshwater habitats, and their supplying role in aquatic biogeochemical cycles is generally considered vital. The objective of this study was to analyse whether an increasing proportion of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria affects (i) the composition of the non-diazotrophic component of ambient phytoplankton communities and (ii) resource use efficiency (RUE; ratio of Chl a to total nutrients) - an important ecosystem function. We hypothesize that diazotrophs increase community P use and decrease N use efficiencies, as new N is brought into the system, relaxing N, and concomitantly aggravating P limitation. We test this by analysing an extensive data set from the Baltic Sea (>3700 quantitative phytoplankton samples), known to harbour conspicuous and recurrent blooms of Nodularia spumigena and Aphanizomenon sp. System-level phosphorus use efficiency (RUEP) was positively related to high proportion of diazotrophic cyanobacteria, suggesting aggravation of phosphorus limitation. However, concomitant decrease of nitrogen use efficiency (RUEN) was not observed. Nodularia spumigena, a dominant diazotroph and a notorious toxin producer, had a significantly stronger relationship with RUEP, compared to the competing non-toxic Aphanizomenon sp., confirming niche differentiation in P acquisition strategies between the major bloom-forming cyanobacterial species in the Baltic Sea. Nodularia occurrences were associated with stronger temperature stratification in more offshore environments, indicating higher reliance on insitu P regeneration. By using constrained and unconstrained ordination, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and local similarity analysis, we show that diazotrophic cyanobacteria explained no more than a few percentage of the ambient phytoplankton community variation. The analyses furthermore yielded rather evenly distributed negative and positive effects on individual co-occurring phytoplankton taxa, with no obvious phylogenetic or functional trait-based patterns.Synthesis. Our study reveals that despite the widely acknowledged noxious impacts of cyanobacterial blooms, the overall effect on phytoplankton community structure is minor. There are no predominantly positive or negative associations with ambient phytoplankton species. Species-specific niche differences in cyanobacterial resource acquisition affect important ecosystem functions, such as biomass production per unit limiting resource.

AB QuestionsThe link between the carbon composition of aquatic plants and (1) plant strategies and (2) habitat nutrient availability has received little attention. We tested whether three aquatic species belonging to the three adaptive strategies defined by Grime (ruderal, stress tolerant and competitive) had contrasting carbon allocation patterns, and if these patterns varied in the same way between populations distributed along a gradient of habitat nutrient content.
   LocationWetlands in the northern Rhone River Basin, France.
   MethodsThe three species were sampled in 17 wetlands along a gradient of nutrient content in the northern Rhone River Basin. In each population sampled, we measured plant water content, C/N ratio, structural compounds (lignin and structural polysaccharides) and storage compounds (free sugars and starch) in two seasons (spring and autumn 2012).
   ResultsThe stress-tolerant species had higher content of structural compounds than the competitive and ruderal species. The content of storage compounds was higher in the competitive and stress-tolerant species compared to the ruderal species. Allocation of carbon compounds varied with habitat nutrient content in different ways for the three species, suggesting contrasting plasticities, possibly linked to plant strategy.
   ConclusionPlant strategies and habitat nutrient content are likely key drivers in plant carbon allocation and should be taken into account when studying interactions between habitat and plant quality.

AB Species' ranges are shifting globally in response to climate warming, with substantial variability among taxa, even within regions. Relationships between range dynamics and intrinsic species traits may be particularly apparent in the ocean, where temperature more directly shapes species' distributions. Here, we test for a role of species traits and climate velocity in driving range extensions in the ocean-warming hotspot of southeast Australia. Climate velocity explained some variation in range shifts, however, including species traits more than doubled the variation explained. Swimming ability, omnivory and latitudinal range size all had positive relationships with range extension rate, supporting hypotheses that increased dispersal capacity and ecological generalism promote extensions. We find independent support for the hypothesis that species with narrow latitudinal ranges are limited by factors other than climate. Our findings suggest that small-ranging species are in double jeopardy, with limited ability to escape warming and greater intrinsic vulnerability to stochastic disturbances.

AB The duration of the dry seasons in south-eastern Amazonia is expected to increase. Little is known of how freshwater assemblages respond to drought in the humid rainforests and of the extent to which they resist the absence of rainfall before the collapse of the system. We manipulated rainshelters over tank-forming bromeliads (i.e. the interlocking leaf axils of these plants form wells that collect rainwater) to simulate an exceptionally long dry period (49days, compared with a 10-year meanSD annual maximum number of 175.3days without rainfall at the study site) and then a rewetting period. By sampling weekly over 3months, we followed the dynamics of the representation of abundance-weighted traits in invertebrate assemblages in these treatment plants and in a control group. The functional structure of assemblages was drought resistant until the water volume in the bromeliad pools dropped by 90%, when there was a sudden shift in the functional trait structure due to the loss of most populations except the drought-resistant culicids. Traits related to life history, body size and preferred food showed significant responses to drought. There was a convergence in the functional traits of species surviving in dry plants, strengthening the idea that environmental filtering, rather than stochasticity, determines the functional trajectory of aquatic assemblages during drought. At the end of the dry period, samples of the detritus potentially containing drought-resistant eggs/cysts (and eventually live larvae) were taken from the dry plants and rewetted in the laboratory, allowing us to distinguish resistant species from those requiring recolonisation via subsequent oviposition by adults from elsewhere. Patches of water-filled bromeliads persisting in the area provided the most important pool of colonists, and communities returned to the pre-disturbance state within 1-2weeks of rewetting. Our results suggest that the functional trait structure of invertebrate assemblages in bromeliads could remain stable under scenarios of precipitation change that would triple the duration of current dry periods at a local scale. Future experiments should evaluate how environmental factors might alter the tipping point between resistance to drought and a collapse in ecosystem processes.

AB Traits-based community analyses are receiving increasing attention. However, consistent interpretation of empirical results and ecological understanding in stream ecology are limited by ambiguous terminology. Furthermore, the measurement scales used to analyze trait data, especially ordinal-scale data, are often inappropriately applied. We identify and discuss these shortcomings and offer a solution for an operative and algebraically correct treatment of traits and a unified nomenclature that facilitates direct comparison among traits-based studies. A unified terminology allows for logical translation among existing, alternative trait nomenclatures and should facilitate communication of research findings among stream ecologists and more directly connect stream traits-based research with general ecology.

AB Rhinogobius fishes (Gobiidae) are distributed widely in East and Southeast Asia, and represent the most species-rich group of freshwater gobies with diversified life histories (i.e., amphidromous, fluvial, and lentic). To reveal their phylogenetic relationships and life history evolution patterns, we sequenced six nuclear and three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) loci from 18 species, mainly from the mainland of Japan and the Ryukyu Archipelago. Our phylogenetic tree based on nuclear genes resolved three major clades, including several distinct subclades. The mtDNA and nuclear DNA phylogenies showed large discordance, which strongly suggested mitochondrial introgression through large-scale interspecific hybridization in these regions. On the basis of the molecular dating using geological data as calibration points, the hybridization occurred in the early to middle Pleistocene. Reconstruction of the ancestral states of life history traits based on nuclear DNA phylogeny suggests that the evolutionary change from amphidromous to freshwater life, accompanied by egg size change, occurred independently in at least three lineages. One of these lineages showed two life history alterations, i.e., from amphidromous (small egg) to fluvial (large egg) to lentic (small egg). Although more inclusive analysis using species outside Japan should be further conducted, the present results suggest the importance of the life history evolution associated with high adaptability to freshwater environments in the remarkable species diversification in this group. Such life history divergences may have contributed to the development of reproductive isolation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Stable isotope analyses have emerged as an insightful tool for ecologists, with quantitative methods being developed to analyse data at the population, community and food web levels. In parallel, functional ecologists have developed metrics to quantify the multiple facets of functional diversity in a n-dimensional space based on functional traits. Here, we transferred and adapted metrics developed by functional ecologists into a set of four isotopic diversity metrics (isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness and uniqueness) complementary to the existing metrics. Specifically, these new metrics are mathematically independent of the number of organisms analysed and account for the abundance of organisms. They can also be calculated with more than two stable isotopes. In addition, we also provide a procedure for calculating the levels of isotopic overlap (similarity and turnover) between two groups of organisms. These metrics have been implemented into new functions in R made freely available to users and we illustrated their application using stable isotope values from a freshwater fish community. Transferring the framework developed initially for measuring functional diversity to stable isotope ecology will allow more efficient assessments of changes in the multiple facets of isotopic diversity following anthropogenic disturbances.

AB The effects of different dietary inclusion levels (0, 5 and 10%) of IMTA-cultivated Gracilaria vermiculophylla on rainbow trout growth performance and flesh quality traits were evaluated. Flesh chemical composition (moisture, protein, lipid, vitamin E and iodine contents), sensory attributes and instrumental color were determined after a feeding period of 91 days with the experimental diets. The antioxidant activity of muscle carotenoids and hydrolysates was also determined by the 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) methods. By the end of the experiment, fish fed CTRL or G5 diet reached similar body weight (215-220 g), but fish fed G10 weighed significantly less (167 g). Seaweed inclusion increased flesh moisture and decreased lipid content, with significant differences between the G5 and CTRL groups. Vitamin E content varied among treatments with CTRL fed fish presenting the highest levels of a-tocopherol. Iodine levels in the flesh increased with the seaweed inclusion, with fish fed G5 doubling its iodine content (214.5 mu g/kg) in relation to the CTRL (111.7 mu g/kg). Instrumental color showed that cooked fillets from fish fed seaweed-rich diets were more luminous (L*), less yellowish (b*) and more reddish (a*) than the CTRL. The sensory evaluation showed that fish fed with seaweed had juicier fillets than the CTRL with G5 presenting the most intense (pinkish) color. The instrumental differences are balanced in such away that the sensory panel perceived G5 as the sample with higher color intensity. Muscle carotenoid extracts presented no significant antioxidant activity through the ABTS and DPPH assays, whereas muscle hydrolysates showed similar antioxidant activity in all dietary treatments (ca. 33% through DPPH assay).
   The inclusion of Gracilaria sp. meal in diets for rainbow trout seems to be possible for up to 5%, as higher inclusion levels resulted in significantly smaller fish. The sensory panel perceived G5 as the sample with higher color intensity and juicier than the CTRL. Moreover, flesh iodine content doubled in fish fed G5, confirming seaweed as a natural and effective tool to increase the nutritional value of rainbow trout.
   Statement of relevance/impact of your paper to the general field of commercial aquaculture
   This paper is relevant for the aquafeed industry and fish consumers. Fish meal has traditionally been the major dietary protein source for fish, but its reduction in aquafeeds is now a priority goal for the further expansion and sustainability of farmed fish production. Seaweeds may act as nutrient supply in fish, which in turn could ultimately function as vehicle of valuable compounds in human nutrition. This paper shows that 5% Gracilaria sp. meal can be a natural and effective tool to increase the nutritional value of rainbow trout flesh without impacting growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Life history traits like developmental time, age and size at maturity are directly related to fitness in all organisms and play a major role in adaptive evolution and speciation processes. Comparative genomic or transcriptomic approaches to identify positively selected genes involved in species divergence can help to generate hypotheses on the driving forces behind speciation. Here we use a bottom-up approach to investigate this hypothesis by comparative analysis of orthologous transcripts of four closely related European Radix species.
   Results: Snails of the genus Radix occupy species specific distribution ranges with distinct climatic niches, indicating a potential for natural selection driven speciation based on ecological niche differentiation. We then inferred phylogenetic relationships among the four Radix species based on whole mt-genomes plus 23 nuclear loci. Three different tests to infer selection and changes in amino acid properties yielded a total of 134 genes with signatures of positive selection. The majority of these genes belonged to the functional gene ontology categories "reproduction" and "genitalia" with an overrepresentation of the functions "development" and "growth rate".
   Conclusions: We show here that Radix species divergence may be primarily enforced by selection on life history traits such as (larval-) development and growth rate. We thus hypothesise that life history differences may confer advantages under the according climate regimes, e.g., species occupying warmer and dryer habitats might have a fitness advantage with fast developing susceptible life stages, which are more tolerant to habitat desiccation.

AB The functional diversity of the fish assemblages of the Mondego estuary was studied for a discontinuous 30-year period (1988-2012). During this time, hydrological changes occurred due to man-induced alterations and weather extremes. These changes led to alterations in the structure and function of the fish community. Species richness and functional richness decreased over time and the fish community started to explore new micro-habitats and food resources. Before severe hydrological changes, the community was dominated by pelagic, detritivorous and species with wider salinity ranges. After, the community became dominated by demersal, benthic, piscivorous and marine species. During a drought, omnivorous became increasingly important, reflecting greater possibilities of using available feeding resources. We have also found an increase in sub-tropical species throughout the years, which might be related to gradual temperature increases at a global scale. This study also confirmed estuaries as extremely important for restocking several commercial species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change threatens species directly through environmental changes and indirectly through its effects on species interactions. We need tools to predict which species are most vulnerable to these threats. Pairwise species associations and body size are simple but promising predictors of the relative impact of species introduced outside of their historical ranges. We examined the vulnerability of 30 fish species to the impacts of three centrarchid predators that are being introduced to lakes north of their historical range boundaries. Species that were negatively associated with each centrarchid in their historical range were more likely to be lost from lakes with centrarchid introductions. Total body length was most important in predicting impact for the most gape-limited predator. At the regional scale, our method identifies those species most vulnerable to introductions facilitated by climate change and can easily be applied to a range of taxa undergoing range expansions.

AB A huge tsunami is one of the greatest disturbance events in coastal benthic communities, although the ecological consequences are not fully understood. Here we examined the tsunami-induced changes in the sediment environment and macrozoobenthic assemblage in a eutrophic brackish lagoon in eastern Japan. The 7.2-m-high tsunami completely replaced muddy sediment with drifting sea sand throughout the lagoon, leading to the drastic changes in quantity and quality of sedimental organic matters, sulfide contents, and sediment redox condition. Intensive physical stress devastated the benthic community, but the disappearance of sulfidic muddy bottoms significantly improved the habitat quality for macrozoobenthos. The re-established macrozoobenthic community after 5 months was characterized by (1) a 2-fold higher total density, but sharp declines in species richness, diversity, and evenness; (2) an increased density of opportunistic taxa (e.g., polychaete Pseudopolydora spp. and amphipod Monocorophium uenoi) in newly created sandy bottoms; and (3) disappearance of several dominant taxa including bivalves and chironomid larvae. These findings indicate that the sensitivity and recovery potential of macrozoobenthos were highly taxa-specific, which was closely related to the taxa's ecological characteristics, including tolerance to physical disturbance, life-history traits, and life form. Our data revealed the rapid recolonization of opportunistic macrozoobenthos after a huge tsunami, which would contribute to the functional recovery of estuarine soft-bottom habitats shortly after a disturbance event.

AB Dams are of paramount importance to a wide variety of human services and many of their environmental problems are known; however, there are few studies in the world addressing the impacts on the native vegetation previously distant from water bodies which became close to the lakeshore created by a dam. Thus, this paper aims to analyze the responses of a dry forest to a dam after 15 years. For this, 20 random samples of 40 trees were made, 10 close to the lakeshore and 10 distant from it, by applying the central square point method. Close to the dam, we found higher values regarding basal area, number of trees, number of evergreen trees, and zoochoric syndrome, but there were lower values of Shannon's diversity index. Therefore, the impacts of the dam after 15 years caused several changes to the tree community. The greater basal area close to the dam suggests that water deficit during the dry season was decreased and plants have thicker trunks. On the other hand, this sector had much more zoochoric syndrome and a larger number of evergreen trees than plots which are distant from water, suggesting changes with regard to the community's ecological functions. Furthermore, structural floristic data shows that the sector close to the dam is less similar to other deciduous forests within the same geographical region than the sector distant from water, thus providing evidence of the impacts of dams on the tree community.

AB Due to the lack of knowledge in periphytic algae functional diversity patterns during successional processes in floodplains, the present study aimed to analyze the dynamics of the functional traits and functional diversity of periphytic species during a short-term successional process in a floodplain lake. The functional traits analyzed were size class, growth form, strength of attachment to the substratum, and functional strategies. We evaluated the dynamics of these traits, considering richness, density and biovolume during an 18-day colonization in two hydrological periods. The functional diversity was assessed using the mean pairwise distance index (MPD). Dominant functional traits during the colonization changed in association with the flood pulse. Under the pulse effect, higher development of C-S strategist, loosely attached, filamentous and nanoperiphytic species occurred. The highest values of functional diversity were associated with the algal biomass peak during the colonization and the high water hydrological period, possibly indicating greater efficiency in the ecosystem functioning. These findings show the importance of the functional traits approach in periphyton studies and that the selection of functional traits must be performed taking into account traits that represent the species niche.

AB The present study focuses on the structure and function of phytoplankton community during periods of marked changes in hydrological traits, influenced by an atypical climatic event (La Nina) and its impact on Armando Ribeiro Goncalves Reservoir of Rio Grande do Norte, situated in the Caatinga biome of northeastern Brazil. The main questions addressed were: What are the effects of environmental factors on the temporal variation of Morphologically Based Functional Group (MBFG) of phytoplankton community? How does the composition of cyanobacterial species shift in relation to high and low trends of phytoplankton diversity? The samples were collected monthly during 2008-2009 and analyzed for pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen content and the nutrients, such as, nitrate-nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen, total nitrogen and orthophosphate. Phytoplankton samples were collected for both qualitative and quantitative analyses to evaluate species richness index and species diversity index. The data was divided into two distinct hydrodynamic periods of instability and stability. The results demonstrate considerable changes in dissolved oxygen content, water transparency and nitrogen nutrients, which directly influenced the MBFG of phytoplankton community in space and time. The instability of reservoir water was caused by heavy rainfall, which exerts atypical external disturbances. The seasonal variation of MBFG demonstrates a change in cyanobacterial composition and their diversity during instability and stability periods. MBFG VII, composed by colonial cyanobacteria with mucilage, was associated with reduced values of electrical conductance and alterations in pH. The predominance of filamentous species with heterocyst (MBFG III) occurs only during the hydrodynamic stability period and did not show significant association with analyzed parameters. The co-dominance of MBGFs III, V and VII along with high species diversity of phytoplankton community occurred during the second hydrodynamic instability period which was associated with the reduction in water temperature. It is concluded that the decrease in cyanobacterial species dominance and the general increase in the diversity of phytoplankton community are influenced by pluvial anomaly. The higher water level during the period of pluvial anomaly resulted in nutrient pulse and the mixing of water column in the reservoir, which determined the MBPG phytoplankton community distribution.

AB Exemplary systems for adaptive divergence are often characterized by their large degrees of phenotypic variation. This variation represents the outcome of generations of diversifying selection. However, adaptive radiations can also contain a hierarchy of differentiation nested within them where species display only subtle phenotypic differences that still have substantial effects on ecology, function, and ultimately fitness. Sexual dimorphisms are also common in species displaying adaptive divergence and can be the result of differential selection between sexes that produce ecological differences between sexes. Understanding the genetic basis of subtle variation (between certain species or sexes) is therefore important for understanding the process of adaptive divergence. Using cichlids from the dramatic adaptive radiation of Lake Malawi, we focus on understanding the genetic basis of two aspects of relatively subtle phenotypic variation. This included a morphometric comparison of the patterns of craniofacial divergence between two ecologically similar species in relation to the larger adaptive radiation of Malawi, and male-female morphological divergence between their F-2 hybrids. We then genetically map craniofacial traits within the context of sex and locate several regions of the genome that contribute to variation in craniofacial shape that is relevant to sexual dimorphism within species and subtle divergence between closely related species, and possibly to craniofacial divergence in the Malawi radiation as a whole. To enhance our search for candidate genes we take advantage of population genomic data and a genetic map that is anchored to the cichlid genome to determine which genes within our QTL regions are associated with SNPs that are alternatively fixed between species. This study provides a holistic understanding of the genetic underpinnings of adaptive divergence in craniofacial shape.

AB There is ample evidence that tube-dwelling invertebrates such as chironomids significantly alter multiple important ecosystem functions, particularly in shallow lakes. Chironomids pump large water volumes, and associated suspended and dissolved substances, through the sediment and thereby compete with pelagic filter feeders for particulate organic matter. This can exert a high grazing pressure on phytoplankton, microorganisms, and perhaps small zooplankton and thus strengthen benthic-pelagic coupling. Furthermore, intermittent pumping by tube-dwelling invertebrates oxygenates sediments and creates a dynamic, three-dimensional mosaic of redox conditions. This shapes microbial community composition and spatial distribution, and alters microbe-mediated biogeochemical functions, which often depend on redox potential. As a result, extended hotspots of element cycling occur at the oxic-anoxic interfaces, controlling the fate of organic matter and nutrients as well as fluxes of nutrients between sediments and water. Surprisingly, the mechanisms and magnitude of interactions mediated by these organisms are still poorly understood. To provide a synthesis of the importance of tube-dwelling invertebrates, we review existing research and integrate previously disregarded functional traits into an ecosystem model. Based on existing research and our models, we conclude that tube-dwelling invertebrates play a central role in controlling water column nutrient pools, and hence water quality and trophic state. Furthermore, these tiny ecosystem engineers can influence the thresholds that determine shifts between alternate clear and turbid states of shallow lakes. The large effects stand in contrast to the conventional limnological paradigm emphasizing predominantly pelagic food webs. Given the vast number of shallow lakes worldwide, benthic invertebrates are likely to be relevant drivers of biogeochemical processes at regional and global scales, thereby mediating feedback mechanisms linked to climate change.

AB Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) inhabit regions rich in biodiversity that play an important role in the local and regional water cycle. Canopy plants such as epiphytes and hemiepiphytes are an important component of the biodiversity in the TMCF and therefore play a significant role in the carbon, nutrient, and water cycles. With only partial or no access to resources on the ground, canopy plants may be vulnerable to changes in climate that increase canopy temperatures and decrease atmospheric humidity or precipitation inputs. Despite their importance in the TMCF, little is known about variation in functional strategies relating to drought avoidance or drought tolerance of canopy plants. In this study, we quantified variation in a number of functional traits in 11 species of epiphytes and hemiepiphytes in a Costa Rican TMCF. We also generated pressure-volume and xylem vulnerability curves that we used as indicators of drought tolerance. In addition, we hand-sectioned fresh leaves and examined cross sections under a microscope to quantify leaf thickness, mesophyll thickness and the thickness of water storage cell layers (i.e., hydrenchyma), if present. Lastly, we determined the capacity for foliar water uptake in the laboratory and measured whole-plant transpiration in the field.
   A trade-off was found between traits that confer relative drought resistance and foliar water uptake capacity vs. traits that confer leaf capacitance and relative drought avoidance. This trade-off may represent an additional axis of the leaf economics spectrum that is unique to epiphytes. We also found that all species had the capacity for foliar uptake of water and that this process contributed substantially to their water balance. On average, foliar uptake of water contributed to the reabsorption of 70% of the water transpired over a relatively wet, 34-day study period. Our results indicate that canopy plants can mitigate water loss substantially via internal water storage or that they can directly utilize cloud water to offset losses. Our results indicate that species that rely on foliar uptake of water may be more vulnerable to projected changes in climate than species that buffer the effects of drought via internal water storage.

AB Predicting ecosystem function from environmental conditions is a central goal of ecosystem ecology. However, many traditional ecosystem models are tailored for specific regions or ecosystem types, requiring several regional models to predict the same function. Alternatively, trait-based approaches have been effectively used to predict community structure in both terrestrial and aquatic environments and ecosystem function in a limited number of terrestrial examples. Here, we test the efficacy of a trait-based model in predicting gross primary production (GPP) in lake ecosystems. We incorporated data from >1000 United States lakes along with laboratory-generated phytoplankton trait data to build a trait-based model of GPP and then validated the model with GPP observations from a separate set of globally distributed lakes. The trait-based model performed as well as or outperformed two ecosystem models both spatially and temporally, demonstrating the efficacy of trait-based models for predicting ecosystem function over a range of environmental conditions.

AB Mixotrophy is a valuable functional trait used by microbes when environmental conditions vary broadly or resources are limited. In the sunlit waters of the ocean, photoheterotrophy, a form of mixotrophy, is often mediated by proteorhodopsin (PR), a seven helices transmembrane protein binding the retinal chromophore. Altogether, they allow bacteria to capture photic energy for sensory and proton gradient formation cell functions. The seasonal occurrence and diversity of the gene coding for PR in cold oligotrophic polar oceans is not known and PR expression has not yet been reported. Here we show that PR is widely distributed among bacterial taxa, and that PR expression decreased markedly during the winter months in the Arctic Ocean. Gammaproteobacteria-like PR sequences were always dominant. However, within the second most common affiliation, there was a transition from Flavobacteria-like PR in early winter to Alphaproteobacteria-like PR in late winter. The phylogenetic shifts followed carbon dynamics, where patterns in expression were consistent with community succession, as identified by DNA community fingerprinting. Although genes for PR were always present, the trend in decreasing transcripts from January to February suggested reduced functional utility of PR during winter. Under winter darkness, sustained expression suggests that PR may continue to be useful for non-ATP forming functions, such as environmental sensing or small solute transport. The persistence of PR expression in winter among some bacterial groups may offer a competitive advantage, where its multifunctionality enhances microbial survival under harsh polar conditions.

AB Trait-based risk assessments of invasive species focus on identifying intrinsic biological or ecological traits associated with invasion success, which allows for a new species' invasion risk to be assessed a priori, thus facilitating cost-effective prevention strategies. However, human preferences for species traits-preferences that might affect which species enter into different pathways of invasion-exist for taxa closely associated with people. Disregarding such preferences can confound correlations between species traits and invasion success. Here we develop a risk assessment for crayfish, a group of culturally and ecologically important decapod crustaceans with numerous harmful invasive species, that explicitly accounts for species traits as well as human preferences as they are expressed in different pathways (e.g., aquaculture, live angling bait for fishing, harvesting). Our results indicate that species traits and human preferences are confounded for introduction and establishment risk models, but subsequent spread risk is not associated with human preferences and can be predicted by clutch size. Although not commonly addressed, this study demonstrates that accounting for human preferences in trait-based risk assessments is important for taxa closely associated with people, as pre-introduction human selection of traits may bias such analyses.

AB Global transformations extend beyond local habitats; therefore, larger-scale approaches are needed to assess community-level responses and resilience to unfolding environmental changes. Using long-term data (1996-2011), we evaluated spatial patterns and functional redundancies in the littoral invertebrate communities of 85 Swedish lakes, with the objective of assessing their potential resilience to environmental change at regional scales (that is, spatial resilience). Multivariate spatial modeling was used to differentiate groups of invertebrate species exhibiting spatial patterns in composition and abundance (that is, deterministic species) from those lacking spatial patterns (that is, stochastic species). We then determined the functional feeding attributes of the deterministic and stochastic invertebrate species, to infer resilience. Between one and three distinct spatial patterns in invertebrate composition and abundance were identified in approximately one-third of the species; the remainder were stochastic. We observed substantial differences in metrics between deterministic and stochastic species. Functional richness and diversity decreased over time in the deterministic group, suggesting a loss of resilience in regional invertebrate communities. However, taxon richness and redundancy increased monotonically in the stochastic group, indicating the capacity of regional invertebrate communities to adapt to change. Our results suggest that a refined picture of spatial resilience emerges if patterns of both the deterministic and stochastic species are accounted for. Spatially extensive monitoring may help increase our mechanistic understanding of community-level responses and resilience to regional environmental change, insights that are critical for developing management and conservation agendas in this current period of rapid environmental transformation.

AB An extensive collection of nearly 4200 fossil plants remains from lower Miocene deposits at Mina and Brest'any were examined for signs of damage caused by arthropods. Determining the frequency and diversity of plant-arthropod interactions was the main objective, followed by a comparison of the level of damage to plant taxa for which there were at least 25 specimens. There were significant differences in the frequencies of the damage caused by the different functional feeding groups in the whole assemblage and individual taxa. Comparison of the diversity of the different types of damage by rarefying their five occurrences also confirmed the differences in the levels attained. The highest diversity was recorded for deciduous trees (Alms, Nyssa and Populus). The organisms that caused some of the highly specific types of damage, such as mining and oviposition, were taxonomically identified on the basis of their unique morphological traits. There was one remarkable non-herbivore plant-arthropod interaction represented by a solitary record of a caddisfly case built exclusively of Taxodium needles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB We developed an ecological model to characterize the structure and functioning of the marine continental shelf and slope area of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, from Toulon to Cape La Nao (NWM model), in the early 2000s. The model included previously modeled areas in the NW Mediterranean (the Gulf of Lions and the Southern Catalan Sea) and expanded their ranges, covering 45,547 km(2), with depths from 0 to 1000 in. The study area was chosen to specifically account for the connectivity between the areas and shared fish stocks and fleets.
   Input data were based on local scientific surveys and fishing statistics, published data on stomach content analyses, and the application of empirical equations to estimate consumption and production rates. The model was composed of 54 functional groups, from primary producers to top predators, and Spanish and French fishing fleets were considered. Results were analyzed using ecological indicators and compared with outputs from ecosystem models developed in the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Cadiz prior to this study.
   Results showed that the main trophic flows were associated with detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. Several high trophic level organisms (such as dolphins, benthopelagic cephalopods, large demersal fishes from the continental shelf, and other large pelagic fishes), and the herbivorous salema fish, were identified as keystone groups within the ecosystem. Results confirmed that fishing impact was high and widespread throughout the food web. The comparative approach highlighted that, despite productivity differences, the ecosystems shared common features in structure and functioning traits such as the important role of detritus, the dominance of the pelagic fraction in terms of flows and the importance of benthic pelagic coupling.

AB Internationally, waterways within urban area are subject to broad-scale environmental pollution. In this study, we used in-stream aquatic insects as surrogates to measure the aquatic health of urban streams in the Douala township. We compared these assessments with samples collected from a suburb stream. Aquatic insects were sampled monthly over a 13-month period in ten urban sites and two forest sites. Measurements of the environmental variables were done simultaneously. Results revealed that urban streams are highly polluted and ecologically impaired. The classification of samples by the self-organized mapping analysis permitted to clearly separate urban and non-urban aquatic insect assemblages. Higher total taxa richness, higher values of diversity indices, and higher Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT) scores were recorded in forest sites. Inversely, in urban streams, very low taxa richness was observed, with the proliferation of dipterans, and the absence of EPT taxa. The EPT, coleoptera, and hemiptera taxa, the functional feeding groups of shredders and predators, and the insect taxa relying on gills and plastron for breathing were good predictors of anthropogenic pollution. Indicator taxa and ecological functioning traits identified in this study could enhance the accuracy of water quality assessment methodologies and potentially enable predictive models for evaluating the human impact in stream ecosystems.

AB Benthic infaunal data collected from 1993 to 2010 were analysed to examine the effect of long term discharge of fine limestone tailings on macrofaunal species assemblages in a fjord. Relative distance from the outfall and proportion of fine tailings in the sediment were correlated with benthic community structure. Diversity decreased with increasing proportion of fine tailings. Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) was used to explore the temporal and spatial effects of the tailings gradient on macrofaunal functional attributes. BTA revealed that all stations along a pressure gradient of fine limestone tailings were dominated by free-living species. As the proportion of fine tailings in the sediment increased, there was an increase in fauna that were smaller, highly mobile, living on or nearer the surface sediment, with shorter lifespans. There was a decrease in permanent tube dwellers, those fauna with low or no mobility, that live deeper in the sediment and have longer lifespans (>5 yrs). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Trait-based approaches have been widely applied to investigate how community dynamics respond to environmental gradients. In this study, we applied a series of maximum entropy (maxent) models incorporating functional traits to unravel the processes governing macro-phyte community structure along water depth gradient in a freshwater lake. We sampled 42 plots and 1513 individual plants, and measured 16 functional traits and abundance of 17 macrophyte species. Study results showed that maxent model can be highly robust (99.8%) in predicting the species relative abundance of macrophytes with observed community-weighted mean (CWM) traits as the constraints, while relative low (about 30%) with CWM traits fitted from water depth gradient as the constraints. The measured traits showed notably distinct importance in predicting species abundances, with lowest for perennial growth form and highest for leaf dry mass content. For tuber and leaf nitrogen content, there were significant shifts in their effects on species relative abundance from positive in shallow water to negative in deep water. This result suggests that macrophyte species with tuber organ and greater leaf nitrogen content would become more abundant in shallow water, but would become less abundant in deep water. Our study highlights how functional traits distributed across gradients provide a robust path towards predictive community ecology.

AB Hypotheses to explain phylogeographic structure traditionally invoke geographic features, but often fail to provide a general explanation for spatial patterns of genetic variation. Organisms' intrinsic characteristics might play more important roles than landscape features in determining phylogeographic structure. We developed a novel comparative approach to explore the role of ecological and life-history variables in determining spatial genetic variation and tested it on frog communities in Panama. We quantified spatial genetic variation within 31 anuran species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences, for which hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation analyses rejected simultaneous divergence over a common landscape. Regressing ecological variables, on genetic divergence allowed us to test the importance of individual variables revealing that body size, current landscape resistance, geographic range, biogeographic origin and reproductive mode were significant predictors of spatial genetic variation. Our results support the idea that phylogeographic structure represents the outcome of an interaction between organisms and their environment, and suggest a conceptual integration we refer to as trait-based phylogeography.

AB Microbes are critical components of ecosystems and provide vital services (e.g., photosynthesis, decomposition, nutrient recycling). From the diverse roles microbes play in natural ecosystems, high levels of functional diversity result. Quantifying this diversity is challenging, because it is weakly associated with morphological differentiation. In addition, the small size of microbes hinders morphological and behavioral measurements at the individual level, as well as interactions between individuals. Advances in microbial community genetics and genomics, flow cytometry and digital analysis of still images are promising approaches. They miss out, however, on a very important aspect of populations and communities: the behavior of individuals. Video analysis complements these methods by providing in addition to abundance and trait measurements, detailed behavioral information, capturing dynamic processes such as movement, and hence has the potential to describe the interactions between individuals. We introduce BEMOVI, a package using the R and ImageJ software, to extract abundance, morphology, and movement data for tens to thousands of individuals in a video. Through a set of functions BEMOVI identifies individuals present in a video, reconstructs their movement trajectories through space and time, and merges this information into a single database. BEMOVI is a modular set of functions, which can be customized to allow for peculiarities of the videos to be analyzed, in terms of organisms features (e.g., morphology or movement) and how they can be distinguished from the background. We illustrate the validity and accuracy of the method with an example on experimental multispecies communities of aquatic protists. We show high correspondence between manual and automatic counts and illustrate how simultaneous time series of abundance, morphology, and behavior are obtained from BEMOVI. We further demonstrate how the trait data can be used with machine learning to automatically classify individuals into species and that information on movement behavior improves the predictive ability.

AB Tropical forest functional diversity, which is a measure of the diversity of organismal interactions with the environment, is poorly understood despite its importance for linking evolutionary biology to ecosystem biogeochemistry. Functional diversity is reflected in functional traits such as the concentrations of different compounds in leaves or the density of leaf mass, which are related to plant activities such as plant defence, nutrient cycling, or growth. In the Amazonian lowlands, river movement and microtopography control nutrient mobility, which may influence functional trait distributions. Here we use airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to develop maps of 16 forest canopy traits, throughout four large landscapes that harbour three common forest community types on the Madre de Dios and Tambopata rivers in southwestern Amazonia. Our maps, which are based on quantitative chemometric analysis of forest canopies with visible-to-near infrared (400-2,500 nm) spectroscopy, reveal substantial variation in canopy traits and their distributions within and among forested landscapes. Forest canopy trait distributions are arranged in a nested pattern, with location along rivers controlling trait variation between different landscapes, and microtopography controlling trait variation within landscapes. We suggest that processes of nutrient deposition and depletion drive increasing phosphorus limitation, and a corresponding increase in plant defence, in an eastward direction from the base of the Andes into the Amazon Basin.

AB During the past 100years, most large rivers in North America have been altered for flood control, hydropower, navigation or water supply development. Although these activities clearly provide important human services, their associated environmental disturbances can profoundly affect stream-dwelling organisms. We used dynamic multi-species occupancy models combined with a trait-based approach to estimate the influence of site-level and species-level characteristics on patch dynamic rates for 15 darter species native to the Elk River, a large, flow-regulated Tennessee River tributary in Tennessee and Alabama. Dynamic occupancy modelling results indicated that for every 2.5 degrees C increase in stream temperature, darters were 3.94 times more likely to colonize previously unoccupied stream reaches. Additionally, large-bodied darter species were 3.72 times more likely to colonize stream reaches compared with small-bodied species, but crevice-spawning darter species were 5.24 times less likely to colonize previously unoccupied stream reaches. In contrast, darters were 2.21 times less likely to become locally extinct for every 2.5 degrees C increase in stream temperature, but high stream discharge conditions elevated the risk of local extinction. Lastly, the presence of populations in neighbouring upstream study reaches contributed to a lower risk of extinction, whereas the presence of populations in neighbouring downstream study reaches contributed to higher rates of colonization. Our study demonstrates the application of a trait-based approach combined with a metapopulation framework to assess the patch dynamics of darters in a regulated river. Results from our study will provide a baseline for evaluating the ecological consequences of alternative dam operations. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In Portland (Oregon, USA), restoration actions have been undertaken at the watershed scale (e.g. revegetation and stormwater management) to improve water quality and, where water quality and quantity are adequate at the reach scale, to increase habitat heterogeneity. Habitat enhancement in urban streams can be important for threatened species, but challenging, because of altered catchment hydrology and urban encroachment on floodplains and channel banks. To evaluate reach-scale restoration projects in the Tryon Creek watershed, we sampled benthic macroinvertebrates and conducted habitat quality surveys pre-project and over 4years post-project. Species sensitive to pollution and diversity of trophic groups increased after restoration. Taxonomic diversity increased after restoration but was still low compared with reference streams. We found no significant changes in trait proportions and functional diversity. Functional diversity, proportion of shredders and semivoltine invertebrates were significantly higher in reference streams than in the restored stream reaches. We hypothesized that inputs of coarse particulate organic matter and land use at watershed scale may explain the differences in biodiversity between restored and reference stream reaches. Habitat variables did not change from pre-project to post-project, so they could not explain community changes. This may have been partly attributable to insensitivity of the visual estimate methods used but likely also reflects the importance of watershed variables on aquatic biotasuggesting watershed actions may be more effective for the ecological recovery of streams. For future projects, we recommend multihabitat benthic sampling supported by studies of channel geomorphology to better understand stream response to restoration actions.

AB Loss of biodiversity and nutrient enrichment are two of the most pervasive drivers of change in ecosystems globally. However, little is known about how these disturbances interact to affect ecosystem functioning. We established a field experiment to test for effects of loss of consumer species on algal assemblages (richness and assemblage structure) and ecosystem functioning (ecosystem productivity and algal biomass accumulation) on rocky shores. We manipulated the presence of three common molluscan grazer species in newly created rock pools over 13months. Our grazer manipulation was based on a subtractive experimental design, and we also manipulated nutrient concentrations to evaluate explicitly how resource availability affected the consequences of species loss. We found that the effects of loss of grazer species on algal assemblages and their functioning depended strongly on both the identity of the grazer species lost and of those remaining in the community. Moreover, the effects of loss of species depended on nutrient availability, making it extremely difficult to predict the effects of species loss generally without detailed knowledge of a system. Our results demonstrate clearly that the effects of grazer species loss on primary producers and ecosystem functioning may not be generalisable based on grazer functional roles or traits.Synthesis. Our findings highlight the need to include key physical drivers, such as nutrient availability, explicitly into biodiversity-ecosystem functioning models in order to move towards a predictive framework that incorporates the effects of both environmental heterogeneity and anthropogenic stressors.

AB Wood density is a key plant functional trait which integrates the trade-offs characteristic to riparian plant ecological strategies. Although high-density wood is costly to construct, it confers mechanical stiffness to stems, increasing a plant's capacity to withstand flooding, and also enables increased tolerance to water stress. For riparian plants, fluctuations in soil moisture driven by surface hydrology should therefore be an important driver of variation in wood density. We asked the following questions in the study: (1) Does wood density increase with increasing frequency and magnitude of flood disturbance? (2) Does wood density increase with increasing unpredictability of water availability in the riparian zone? (3) Does dispersion of wood density peak at intermediate levels of hydrological disturbance? We surveyed wood density of dominant species at 15 riparian sites along flow-gauged rivers across south-eastern Australia. Due to the broad range of hydrological variability associated with Australian river systems, this set of sites functions as a useful model for assessing the response of riparian plants to changing hydrological conditions. We found wood density varied strongly along a single axis of hydrological variability. This axis integrates flood intensity and frequency with metrics of hydrological unpredictability and can be conceptualized as a gradient of environmental harshness, with higher wood density associated with harsher conditions.Synthesis. Our study highlights the importance of hydrological conditions, particularly disturbance and environmental unpredictability, as determinants of ecological strategy in riparian plants. Large, rare flood events in particular appear to favour higher wood density strategies. This is likely to have significant ecological consequences for riparian plant communities in a south-east Australian context, as well as in other regions where increasing climatic variability and frequency of extreme events are hallmarks of climate change predictions.

AB Fish develop morphological specializations in their trophic and locomotor systems as a result of varying functional demands in response to environmental pressures at different life stages. These specializations should maximize particular performances in specialists, adapting them to their trophic and habitat niches at each ontogenetic stage. Because differential growth rates of the structural components comprised in the head are likely to be linked to the diet of a fish throughout its development, we investigated the ontogenetic development of two haplochromine cichlid species belonging to different trophic guilds. We employed geometric morphometric techniques to evaluate whether starting from morphologically similar fry they diverge into phenotypes that characterize trophic guilds and locomotor types. Our examination of overall body shape shows that certain specialized morphological features are already present in fry, whereas other traits diverge through ontogeny due to differences in species-specific allometric variation. Allometric shape variation was found to be more relevant for the biter specialist than for the sucker morphotype. Our results confirm that phenotypic changes during ontogeny can be linked to dietary and habitat shifts in these fish. Furthermore, evidence for an integrated development of trophic and locomotor specializations in morphology was observed. J. Morphol. 276:860-871, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Many environmental stressors manifest their effects via physiological processes (traits) that can differ significantly among species and species groups. We compiled available data for three traits related to the bioconcentration of the toxic metal cadmium (Cd) from 42 species representing the aquatic insect orders Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies) and Trichoptera (caddisflies). These traits included the propensity to take up Cd from water (uptake rate constant, k(u)), the ability to excrete Cd (efflux rate constant, k(e)) and the net result of these two processes (bioconcentration factor). Ranges in these Cd bioaccumulation traits varied in magnitude across clades (some clades had a greater tendency to bioaccumulate Cd than others). Overlap in the ranges of trait values among different clades was common and highlights situations where species from different lineages can share a similar trait state, but represent the high end of possible physiological values for one clade and the low end for another. Variance around the mean trait states differed widely across clades, suggesting that some groups (e.g. Ephemerellidae) are inherently more variable than others (e.g. Perlidae). Thus, trait variability/lability is at least partially a function of lineage. Akaike information criterion comparisons of statistical models were more often driven by lineage than by the other tested potential biological or ecological explanations. Lineage-driven models generally improved with increasing taxonomic resolution. Together, these findings suggest that lineage provides context for the analysis of species traits and that failure to consider lineage in community-based analysis of traits may obscure important patterns of species responses to environmental change.

AB Environmental change can cause regime shifts in ecosystems, potentially threatening ecosystem services. It is unclear if the degradation status of ecosystems correlates with their vulnerability to environmental change, and thus the risk of future regime shifts. We assessed resilience in acidified (degraded) and circumneutral (undegraded) lakes with long-term data (1988-2012), using time series modeling. We identified temporal frequencies in invertebrate assemblages, which identifies groups of species whose population dynamics vary at particular temporal scales. We also assessed species with stochastic dynamics, those whose population dynamics vary irregularly and unpredictably over time. We determined the distribution of functional feeding groups of invertebrates within and across the temporal scales identified, and in those species with stochastic dynamics, and assessed attributes hypothesized to contribute to resilience. Three patterns of temporal dynamics, consistent across study lakes, were identified in the invertebrates. The first pattern was one of monotonic change associated with changing abiotic lake conditions. The second and third patterns appeared unrelated to the environmental changes we monitored. Acidified and the circumneutral lakes shared similar levels and patterns of functional richness, evenness, diversity, and redundancy for species within and across the observed temporal scales and for stochastic species groups. These similar resilience characteristics suggest that both lake types did not differ in vulnerability to the environmental changes observed here. Although both lake types appeared equally vulnerable in this study, our approach demonstrates how assessing systemic vulnerability by quantifying ecological resilience can help address uncertainty in predicting ecosystem responses to environmental change across ecosystems.

AB The objectives of this study were to assess the biological water of the Iranian Tajan River using different metrics, i.e., a Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index (MMI) and a traits-based method. Twenty-eight physico-chemical parameters, 10 habitat factors, and abundance of macroinvertebrates were obtained for 17 sites. The Shahid-Rajaie dam divides the Tajan River into an up- and downstream part, with different land uses. Eighteen metrics were used to represent four components of ecosystem quality, including tolerance (Hilsenhoff, SIGNAL), diversity (Margalef, Shannon-Wiener, Simpson, and Evenness), abundance (total number of taxa, individuals, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, EPT, and Insects), and composition of assemblages (% Ephemeroptera, % Plecoptera, % Trichoptera, and % EPT Taxa). The integrated MMI was calculated by averaging the obtained scores of all indices. In the next step, we gathered information on 22 biological traits of macroinvertebrates to evaluate whether (group of) traits could be identified that are indicative for specific or general stress. Result showed a decrease in MMI from upstream (very good water quality) to downstream (bad) due to human activities. Industrial activities like pulping and papermaking operations or sand mining in the downstream part had more effects than agriculture and fish ponds in the upstream part. A redundancy analysis biplot showed the variation between the modalities of trait of macroinvertebrates and their correlation with physico-chemical parameters in Tajan River. The findings show that traits can be indicative for different kind of stress but that more effort has to be put in gathering data sets to disentangle the effect of habitat quality, pollution, and the physico-chemical properties of high- versus lowland rivers.

AB Human activities and the consequent extinctions of native species and invasions of nonnative species have been changing the composition of species assemblages worldwide. These anthropogenic impacts alter not only the richness of assemblages but also the biological dissimilarity among them. However, much of the research effort to date has focused on changes in taxonomic dissimilarity (i.e. accounting for species composition) whether assessments of functional dissimilarity (i.e. accounting for the diversity of biological traits) are much more scarce, despite revealing important complimentary information by accounting for changes in the diversity of biological traits. Here, we assess the temporal (1950s against 2000s) changes in both taxonomic and functional dissimilarities of freshwater fish assemblages across lakes from the Yunnan Plateau in China. The Jaccard index to quantify the changes in both taxonomic and functional dissimilarity. We then partitioned dissimilarity to extract its turnover component and measured the changes in the contribution of turnover to dissimilarity. We found that functional and taxonomic homogenization occurred simultaneously. However, patterns between these two processes differed for some lakes. Taxonomic and functional homogenizations were stronger when the historical level of taxonomic dissimilarity among assemblages was high. The impact of extinctions of native species and invasions of non-native species on homogenization was otherwise complex to disentangle with no significant effect of any of the studied environmental factors. In agreement with other studies, our study proved that change in taxonomic dissimilarity cannot be used to predict changes in functional dissimilarity and, as an indicator of ecosystem functioning, functional dissimilarity should be used together with taxonomic dissimilarity to attain a more holistic understanding of human impacts on natural ecosystems.

AB Trait patterns can give insights into how communities assemble under a functional perspective. We constructed a rotifer trait matrix related to food acquisition and predator defence and calculated Rao's quadratic entropy (Q) as an index of functional diversity to investigate trait patterns in different layers (0-2, 5-35, 0-35 m) for a 5-year dataset of Lake Tovel, Italy. Trait patterns were determined by comparing Q (observed) to Q from random communities. While trait patterns can be determined by species traits, richness, and abundance, in most samples, irrespective of layer, trait patterns could be solely attributed to traits indicating their importance for community assembly. Trait convergence dominated in the upper layer, while trait divergence dominated in the lower layer. Using logistic regression, we related trait patterns to environmental parameters. In the lower layer, trait divergence was linked to competition for food while trait convergence was linked to copepod predation. However, in the upper layer neither competitors nor predators influenced trait patterns, and we suggest that ultraviolet radiation and temperature were the main drivers of trait convergence. Our study indicated that environmental filtering drove rotifer trait patterns in the upper layer, whereas species interactions drove trait patterns in the lower layer.

AB Patterns of association between functional traits and environmental gradients can improve understanding of species assemblage structure from local to regional scales, and therefore may be useful for natural resource management. We measured functional traits related to trophic ecology, habitat use, and life-history strategies of fishes and examined their associations with environmental factors in the Brazos and Trinity River basins in Central Texas. We also examined the relationship between functional diversity of fish assemblages and indices of biotic integrity and habitat quality. Environmental characteristics at the local reach and catchment scales, including the extent of forested area in the watershed, amount of land developed for urban and agricultural uses, stream size, substrate characteristics, and availability of riffle and pool habitats, were significantly associated with functional trait composition of fish assemblages. Broad physiographic differences between ecoregions also had a large influence on taxonomic and functional assemblage structure. In general, the volume of functional trait space occupied by fish assemblages was greatest in streams with high habitat quality scores located within landscapes having less alteration from agriculture and urban development. Distributions of functional traits in fish assemblages might provide an additional basis for assessment of stream condition in relation to environmental impacts.

AB Biological traits relating to the behaviour, morphology and life history of organisms can influence ecological functioning, and this principle is becoming increasingly used to examine the functional response of communities to environmental variation. We quantified the taxonomic and biological traits composition, and the overall abundance and richness, of small (1-8 mm) mobile invertebrate assemblages inhabiting subtidal coralline algal turf (Corallina officinalis) along an environmental gradient ranging from (1) relatively deep, wave-exposed sites with short turf containing a low proportion of fine sediment to (2) shallow wave-sheltered sites with taller turf containing a higher proportion of fine sediment. Turf fauna were diverse (118 taxa) and abundant (12 000-53 000 ind. m(-2)), with assemblages dominated by amphipods and gastropods. Total abundances of invertebrates were higher at the wave-exposed sites. When analysed in multivariate space using proportional abundance, replicates based on taxonomic composition grouped more strongly by site along the overall gradient than those based on traits. As proportions of biological traits remained relatively stable along the gradient, numbers of all traits possessed by individuals were higher at the wave-exposed end of the gradient. Although some environmental variables contributed significantly to explaining multivariate trait and taxa patterns, most individual correlations between environmental variables and traits and taxa were weak. This study shows that biological traits can be shared between taxonomically distinct assemblages of turf-dwelling invertebrates, and indicates a relatively small influence overall of environmental variables on the composition of traits and taxa.

AB Climate is the predominant environmental driver of freshwater assemblage pattern on large spatial scales, and traits of freshwater organisms have shown considerable potential to identify impacts of climate change. Although several studies suggest traits that may indicate vulnerability to climate change, the empirical relationship between freshwater assemblage trait composition and climate has been rarely examined on large scales. We compared the responses of the assumed climate-associated traits from six grouping features to 35 bioclimatic indices (similar to 18 km resolution) for five insect orders (Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera and Trichoptera), evaluated their potential for changing distribution pattern under future climate change and identified the most influential bioclimatic indices. The data comprised 782 species and 395 genera sampled in 4,752 stream sites during 2006 and 2007 in Germany (similar to 357,000 km(2) spatial extent). We quantified the variability and spatial autocorrelation in the traits and orders that are associated with the combined and individual bioclimatic indices. Traits of temperature preference grouping feature that are the products of several other underlying climate-associated traits, and the insect order Ephemeroptera exhibited the strongest response to the bioclimatic indices as well as the highest potential for changing distribution pattern. Regarding individual traits, insects in general and ephemeropterans preferring very cold temperature showed the highest response, and the insects preferring cold and trichopterans preferring moderate temperature showed the highest potential for changing distribution. We showed that the seasonal radiation and moisture are the most influential bioclimatic aspects, and thus changes in these aspects may affect the most responsive traits and orders and drive a change in their spatial distribution pattern. Our findings support the development of trait-based metrics to predict and detect climate-related changes of freshwater assemblages.

AB It has recently been suggested that general rules of change in ecological communities might be found through the development of functional relationships between species traits and performance. The physiological, behavioural and life-history traits of fishes are often organised along a fast-slow lifestyle continuum (FSLC). With respect to resistance (capacity for population to resist change) and resilience (capacity for population to recover from change) to environmental hypoxia, the literature suggests that traits enhancing resilience may come at the expense of traits promoting resistance to hypoxia; a trade-off may exist. Here I test whether three fishes occupying different positions along the FSLC trade-off resistance and resilience to environmental hypoxia. Static respirometry experiments were used to determine resistance, as measured by critical oxygen tension (P-crit), and capacity for (RC) and magnitude of metabolic reduction (RM). Swimming respirometry experiments were used to determine aspects of resilience: critical (U-crit) and optimal swimming speed (U-opt), and optimal cost of transport (COTopt). Results pertaining to metabolic reduction suggest a resistance gradient across species described by the inequality Melanotaenia fluviatilis (fast lifestyle) < Hypseleotris sp. (intermediate lifestyle) < Mogurnda adspersa (slow lifestyle). The U-crit and COTopt data suggest a resilience gradient described by the reverse inequality, and so the experiments generally indicate that three fishes occupying different positions on the FSLC trade-off resistance and resilience to hypoxia. However, the scope of inferences that can be drawn from an individual study is narrow, and so steps towards general, traitbased rules of fish community change along environmental gradients are discussed.

AB Suspension feeders are important players in coastal food webs: by filtering particles suspended in the water column and depositing faeces and pseudofaeces in sediments, they mediate the coupling of pelagic primary and benthic secondary production. However, the potential interference of parasite infections on suspension feeding is not well investigated. We experimentally determined the effect of infections with metacercariae of the common trematode Renicola roscovita on clearance rates and condition of blue mussels Mytilus edulis. We also investigated whether there were differences in the effects of infections between different size classes of mussels. Using controlled infections under lab conditions, our experiment showed that infections significantly reduced the clearance rates of mussels. This effect was less pronounced in small (42% reduction) than in large mussels (71%). In addition, infections significantly reduced mussel body mass index in large (23% reduction) and small (17%) mussels compared to uninfected mussels. These reductions most likely resulted from a combined effect of an interference of the parasites with the mussel's feeding apparatus (with the palps being the preferred infection site of the parasite) and of the energetic demands of the parasites (with metacercariae growing in size after initial infection). These negative effects on mussel filter feeding capacity indicate that parasites can alter a crucially important functional trait of marine suspension feeders.

AB The main goal of this study was to identify the main drivers of natural variability of leaf litter processing in six well preserved Mediterranean mountain streams in the Sierra de Guadarrama, through the analysis of the breakdown rates of alder litter, content and dynamics of leaf nutrients, and associated fungal and invertebrates communities. In general, breakdown rates of alder leaves, both exponential (k = 0.013 +/- 0.005 dd(-1), k = 0.041 +/- 0.011 d(-1)) and lineal (b = 0.470 +/- 0.121 % PSLC dd(-1), b' = 1.522 +/- 0.153 % PSLC d(-1)) were very high. Variability in breakdown rates among streams was not correlated to environmental characteristics (discharge, slope or water temperature) neither to stream water characteristics (nutrient concentration, pH, or conductivity). This may be due to the low environmental heterogeneity observed among these streams and also because the physical factors that could regulate this process were outweighed by biological processes that mask them. The highest breakdown rates were recorded in the coldest waters where the activity of decomposers aquatic fungi was very low (measured by sporulation rates, 98.36 +/- 148.84 conidia mg(-1) PSLC d(-1)), suggesting that consumer invertebrates played a key role in the faster leaf litter processing rates in these sites. Family richness (13.67 +/- 3.44 fam. bag(-1)) and macroinvertebrate density (25.33 +/- 10.42 ind bag(-1)), as well as shredder density (16.17 +/- 7.44 ind bag(-1)) did not show any relationship with the breakdown rates (p > 0.100, neither linear nor exponential rates). A positive relationship was only found between percentage of leaf litter lost and abundance of Limnephilidae (p < 0.010), that pointed out a higher relevance of shredder traits than their total abundance. Limnephilidae are caddisfly shredders adapted to low thermal regimes, they have large body and are able to feed on unconditioned litter debris and poor colonized by aquatic hyphomycetes, which seem to exert a decisive control over leaf litter processing rate in this type of aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, we can suppose that in colder headwater mountain streams consumer macroinvertebrates (shredders) might have a major relevance in the processing of litter debris whereas decomposers (aquatic hyphomycetes) would play an increasing role in warmer streams.

AB Endophyte-assisted phytoremediation has recently been suggested as a successful approach for ecological restoration of metal contaminated soils, however little information is available on the influence of endophytic bacteria on the phytoextraction capacity of metal hyperaccumulating plants in multimetal polluted soils. The aims of our study were to isolate and characterize metal-resistant and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) utilizing endophytic bacteria from tissues of the newly discovered Zn/Cd hyperaccumulator Sedum plumbizinci cola and to examine if these endophytic bacterial strains could improve the efficiency of phytoextraction of multi-metal contaminated soils. Among a collection of 42 metal resistant bacterial strains isolated from the tissues of S. plumbizinci cola grown on Pb/Zn mine tailings, five plant growth promoting endophytic bacterial strains (PGPE) were selected due to their ability to promote plant growth and to utilize ACC as the sole nitrogen source. The five isolates were identified as Bacillus pumilus E2S2, Bacillus sp. E1S2, Bacillus sp. E4S1, Achromobacter sp. E4L5 and Stenotrophomonas sp. E1L and subsequent testing revealed that they all exhibited traits associated with plant growth promotion, such as production of indole-3-acetic acid and siderophores and solubilization of phosphorus. These five strains showed high resistance to heavy metals (Cd, Zn and Pb) and various antibiotics. Further, inoculation of these ACC utilizing strains significantly increased the concentrations of water ektractable Cd and Zn in soil. Moreover, a pot experiment was conducted to elucidate the effects of inoculating metal-resistant ACC utilizing strains on the growth of S. plumbizincicola and its uptake of Cd, Zn and Pb in multi-metal contaminated soils. Out of the five strains, B. pumilus E2S2 significantly increased root (146%) and shoot (17%) length, fresh (37%) and dry biomass (32%) of S. plumbizincicola as well as plant Cd uptake (43%), whereas Bacillus sp. E1S2 significantly enhanced the accumulation of Zn (18%) in plants compared with non-inoculated controls. The inoculated strains also showed high levels of colonization in rhizosphere and plant tissues. Results demonstrate the potential to improve phytoextraction of soils contaminated with multiple heavy metals by inoculating metal hyperaccumulating plants with their own selected functional endophytic bacterial strains.

AB Using established associations between species traits (life history, morphological and behavioural characteristics) and key ecological functions, we applied biological traits analysis (BTA) to investigate the consequences of 40 years of change in two North Sea benthic communities. Ecological functioning (trait composition) was found to be statistically indistinguishable across periods that differed significantly in taxonomic composition. A temporary alteration to functioning was, however, inferred at both sampling stations; coinciding with the North Sea regime shift of the 1980s. Trait composition recovered after 1 year at the station located inside the grounds of a trawl fishery, whereas the station located outside the main area of fishing activity underwent a six-year period of significantly altered, and temporally unstable, trait composition. A further alteration to functioning was inferred at the fished station, when the population of a newly established species rapidly increased in numbers. The results suggest that density compensation by characteristically similar (redundant) taxa acts to buffer changes to ecological functioning over time, but that functional stability is subject to aperiodic disruption due to substitutions of dissimilar taxa or uncompensated population fluctuations. The rate at which ecological functioning stabilises and recovers appears to be dependent on environmental context; e.g. disturbance regime. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrology is a fundamental factor influencing ecosystem dynamics, life-history strategies, and diversity patterns in running-water habitats. However, it remains unclear how hydrology may structure the taxonomic and functional composition of communities, especially in systems with high spatiotemporal variability in flow. We examined invertebrate diversity from 7 desert streams in the Huachuca Mountains of southeastern Arizona, USA, that span a flow permanence continuum from highly intermittent to perennial. We examined the relative roles of flow permanence, habitat size, season, and microhabitat in determining taxonomic and functional structure (according to 7 species traits compiled for 234 taxa) of these communities. We predicted that both functional and taxonomic diversity would be positively related to flow permanence and negatively related to the duration and number of stream drying events. As predicted, increased flow permanence was associated with increased functional richness, functional evenness, and taxonomic richness. Conversely, drying events reduced functional diversity across all measured indices. We found a saturating relationship between functional richness and taxonomic richness, indicating functional redundancy in species-rich communities, which may promote resilience of ecosystem function to environmental variation. Our study adds further evidence that hydrology is a key determinant of aquatic invertebrate diversity, and that stream hydroperiod strongly influences both functional and taxonomic diversity in arid-land streams.

AB A multiple-trait-based approach can provide predictions and interpretations of the responses of freshwater communities to river restoration that apply in different taxonomic contexts. We compared the observed and predicted effects of restoration on sets of traits in fish and invertebrate communities in four reaches of the Rhone River. Restoration included minimum flow increases in three bypassed main channels and the reconnection of eight floodplain channels. Predictions (described in detail in three other articles in this Special Issue) were based on habitat models that related the density of modelled taxa to their physical habitats. We used trait information extracted from the literature to translate predicted taxonomic changes into predicted changes in traits. Observed changes in traits calculated for modelled taxa and for all taxa in the community were both compared to predictions. In 10 of 12 cases, observed changes in traits correlated with predicted ones. With few exceptions, the agreement was higher for fish and invertebrates in the main channels than for invertebrates in floodplain channels. Predictions translated to the trait category level improved those at the taxonomic level in 5/6 and 4/6 cases for modelled taxa and all taxa, respectively. However, the improvement was statistically significant according to a null model for 1/6 and 3/6 cases for modelled taxa and all taxa, respectively. The validation of trait predictions suggested that traits related to locomotion and attachment, as well as general biology and physiology, were particularly suited to predicting and understanding the effects of physical restoration. For example, after restoration, clingers and passive filter feeders dominated invertebrate communities in the main channels, whereas invertebrate communities in the floodplain underwent a selection of traits frequent in running water (clingers, flattened shape and gill respiration). Within fish communities, the periodic life-history strategy that characterises fish species in downstream reaches (long life span, large body, late sexual maturity) increased with restoration, whereas the opportunistic strategy decreased. Our results suggest that a better understanding of how hydraulics shapes traits in riverine systems is critically needed for assessing the effects of restoration measures impacting flow. In addition, existing trait databases (especially for fish) should be expanded to better reflect the energetic trade-offs that organisms must make in various flow contexts.

AB Data-rich restoration experiments offer opportunities to test the ability of bioassessment tools, such as those currently used to assess the ecological status' of waterbodies targeted by the European Water Framework Directive, to detect observed ecological changes. Minimum flow increases in four regulated reaches of the French Rhone River modified the invertebrate and fish communities in a predictable way, as detailed in other articles of this Special Issue. We tested the ability of several fish and macroinvertebrate metrics currently used in bioassessment to detect these changes. In addition, we considered changes in metrics that are expected to respond specifically to flow increase. These metrics were related to the habitat requirements of species, the ecological specialisation of communities and the abundance of macroinvertebrate functional groups (seen as surrogates for ecosystem attributes). For invertebrate communities, bioassessment metrics based on richness had equivocal responses to restoration and the Potamon-Type Index demonstrated no or contradictory responses to restoration. The French biotic index was not sensitive to restoration and instead depicted spatial differences in biological quality. For fish communities, the French fish index was marginally sensitive in the reach with the largest minimum flow increase and some of its metrics were sensitive in other reaches. Contrasting with commonly used bioassessment indices and metrics, several metrics related to habitat requirements appropriately indicated the observed changes in community structure. Large flow changes increased the proportion of fish and macroinvertebrate individuals with preferences for midstream habitats, fast currents, deep waters and/or coarse substrates. However, these changes did not translate into the expected increase in ecological specialisation. In addition, functional metrics indicated that restoration led to higher proportions of grazers and higher availability of suspended food for filtering collectors, suggesting a return to the ecological conditions of a large river. The mixed and potentially contradictory responses of the different metrics confirm the difficulty of establishing benchmarks for ecological indicators in large-regulated rivers and the need to design appropriate bioassessment metrics.

AB AimFunctional diversity is a key facet of biodiversity that is increasingly being measured to quantify its changes following disturbance and to understand its effects on ecosystem functioning. Assessing the functional diversity of assemblages based on species traits requires the building of a functional space (dendrogram or multidimensional space) where indices will be computed. However, there is still no consensus on the best method for measuring the quality of functional spaces.
   InnovationHere we propose a framework for evaluating the quality of a functional space (i.e. the extent to which it is a faithful representation of the initial functional trait values). Using simulated datasets, we analysed the influence of the number and type of functional traits used and of the number of species studied on the identity and quality of the best functional space. We also tested whether the quality of the functional space affects functional diversity patterns in local assemblages, using simulated datasets and a real study case.
   Main conclusionsThe quality of functional space strongly varied between situations. Spaces having at least four dimensions had the highest quality, while functional dendrograms and two-dimensional functional spaces always had a low quality. Importantly, we showed that using a poor-quality functional space could led to a biased assessment of functional diversity and false ecological conclusions. Therefore, we advise a pragmatic approach consisting of computing all the possible functional spaces and selecting the most parsimonious one.

AB In recent years, the analysis of single or multiple species trait patterns was regarded as a reliable biomonitoring tool alternative or in addition to the traditional taxon-based methods. Hitherto, the trait approach was overwhelmingly applied to macroinvertebrate assemblages to monitor anthropogenic induced degradations of freshwater ecosystems. However, little is known yet whether bio-ecological traits derived from speciose and functionally diverse meiobenthic taxa might also provide diagnostic descriptors for the assessment of ecosystem health. The aim of our pilot study was to assess if the trait composition (including life history, morphometrical and ecological attributes) of lake nematode assemblages can reflect signs of cultural eutrophication equally well as the concomitant change in the species composition. Sediment samples for the analysis of the nematodes assemblage structure were taken at littoral sites of 15 German and Swedish lakes. Lakes were assigned to three traditional classes along the trophic continuum-oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic. Canonical correspondence analyses illustrated that both the nematode trait and species compositions were significantly altered to similar extents along the eutrophication gradient. A set of 7 out of 28 trait modalities and a group of 12 from 30 species could be defined as indicative of oligotrophic or eutrophic conditions, and enabled us to discriminate among the three trophic lake states, without confounding effects of pronounced trait intercorrelations. Trait modalities such as a high number of offspring per year and the feeding type suction feeder predominated at the upper range of the enrichment gradient, whereas for modalities such as the obligate asexual reproduction, the feeding type chewer and several specifying nematode morphometrics (short body length, slender body shape) the opposite trend was revealed. However, the observed trait replacement did not imply an increased potential of resilience or resistance to disturbance, suggesting that eutrophication effects rather indirectly shaped nematode assemblages. This first attempt to apply a trait-based analysis to nematode assemblages was found to be successful for distinguishing among different degrees of lake eutrophication. However, compared to macroinvertebrate taxa there remains a great paucity on bio-ecological trait data for nematode species. Therefore future research is demanded to expand and refine nematode trait specifications with the intention to gain further insights into the mechanistic link between responses of nematode populations to environmental alterations.

AB Species' ecological preferences are progressively important for understanding distribution patterns, for conserving biodiversity or for assessing and evaluating the status of freshwater ecosystems. Comprehensive databases compiling species traits are already established in the terrestrial realm, but widely missing in freshwater science. We established a database for European taxa of five aquatic organism groups by compiling information on taxonomy, ecology and distribution based on extensive literature surveys, which were performed by experts for the targeted organism groups. The database includes fishes (654 taxa/21 ecological preferences), macro-invertebrates (8586/40), macrophytes (1083/5), diatoms (8868/36) and phytoplankton (1976/4). It is available online with various options and tools for finding information and has currently over 800 users. The reviewed literature as well as examples given in this paper, highlight the importance of the general availability of knowledge on ecological preferences for various aspects in ecological assessment. Freshwaterecology.info is considered a service for basic research, applied scientists, water managers or other stakeholders. It serves as base for bioassessment and monitoring. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study portrays the frequency and intensity of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in relation to highly changing environmental conditions in a floodplain lake from the Chaco-Pampean region and identifies the factors promoting the growth of different species along a 15-year period marked by important drought and flood periods. Phytoplankton in Laguna Grande was increasingly dominated by cyanobacteria represented by eight bloom-forming species bearing different eco-physiological traits. The bloom development showed strong inter-annual variability in correspondence with the depth of the lake that was affected by local rainfall and the ENSO regional phenomenon. The water level of the lake strongly influenced the species composition, favoring non-heterocystous filaments in deep turbid waters and nitrogen fixing in very short well lit, nitrogen-depleted water columns. Species morphology, dimensions and occurrence of akinetes in the filaments also varied in relation to water level. We suggest that the akinete pool of the sediments played a key role on the occurrence of recurrent Anabaenopsis cf. elenkinii and Sphaerospermopsis cf. aphanizonemoides blooms.

AB In general, community similarity is thought to decay with distance; however, this view may be complicated by the relative roles of different ecological processes at different geographical scales, and by the compositional perspective (e.g. species, functional group and phylogenetic lineage) used. Coastal salt marshes are widely distributed worldwide, but no studies have explicitly examined variation in salt marsh plant community composition across geographical scales, and from species, functional and phylogenetic perspectives. Based on studies in other ecosystems, we hypothesized that, in coastal salt marshes, community turnover would be more rapid at local versus larger geographical scales; and that community turnover patterns would diverge among compositional perspectives, with a greater distance decay at the species level than at the functional or phylogenetic levels. We tested these hypotheses in salt marshes of two regions: The southern Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States. We examined the characteristics of plant community composition at each salt marsh site, how community similarity decayed with distance within individual salt marshes versus among sites in each region, and how community similarity differed among regions, using species, functional and phylogenetic perspectives. We found that results from the three compositional perspectives generally showed similar patterns: there was strong variation in community composition within individual salt marsh sites across elevation; in contrast, community similarity decayed with distance four to five orders of magnitude more slowly across sites within each region. Overall, community dissimilarity of salt marshes was lowest on the southern Atlantic Coast, intermediate on the Gulf Coast, and highest between the two regions. Our results indicated that local gradients are relatively more important than regional processes in structuring coastal salt marsh communities. Our results also suggested that in ecosystems with low species diversity, functional and phylogenetic approaches may not provide additional insight over a species-based approach.

AB Functional coupling, where a singlemorphological trait performs multiple functions, is a universal feature of organismal design. Theory suggests that functional coupling may constrain the rate of phenotypic evolution, yet empirical tests of this hypothesis are rare. In fish, the evolutionary transition from guarding the eggs on a sandy/rocky substrate (i.e. substrate guarding) to mouthbrooding introduces a novel function to the craniofacial system and offers an ideal opportunity to test the functional coupling hypothesis. Using a combination of geometric morphometrics and a recently developed phylogenetic comparative method, we found that head morphology evolution was 43% faster in substrate guarding species than in mouthbrooding species. Furthermore, for species in which females were solely responsible for mouthbrooding the males had a higher rate of head morphology evolution than in those with biparental mouthbrooding. Our results support the hypothesis that adaptations resulting in functional coupling constrain phenotypic evolution.

AB Abiotic variability is known to structure lotic invertebrate communities, yet its influence on lentic invertebrates is not clear. This study tests the hypothesis that variability of nutrients and macro-ions are structuring invertebrate communities in agricultural drainage ditches. This was determined by investigating invertebrate adaptations to disturbance using insect life-history strategies. Many low-lying agricultural areas contain drainage ditches which potentially provide suitable habitat for aquatic invertebrates. In the province of North Holland (The Netherlands) the extensive network of eutrophic ditches are hydrologically managed, creating seasonal variability of water quality arising from agricultural run-off and the inlet of mineral rich, river derived water. This temporal variability was analysed from monitoring data, collected over a 7 month period (February till August) and covering 84 ditches in three soil regions; sand, clay and peat. Invertebrate diversity was determined as local (alpha diversity), regional (gamma diversity) and species-turnover (beta diversity). We ran canonical correspondence analysis and linear mixed models to determine correlations between invertebrate diversity, functional community composition and specific abiotic parameters, including variability (expressed as the Median Absolute Deviation). Invertebrate a diversity was positively correlated to variability in water transparency and negatively correlated to average pH, with the two parameters reflecting a water quality gradient in the environment. Insect life-history strategies expressed adaptations to abiotic variability and harsh (eutrophic) conditions. These adaptations were mainly achieved through good dispersal abilities and developmental trade-offs. The results support measures to reduce influxes of excess nutrients to this network of ditches.

AB Ecological diversity based on quantitative data is widely used to characterize biological communities, but recently morphological and functional traits have also been used to analyse the structure of fish assemblages. This diversity and structure is usually linked to variables such as habitat complexity and composition, depth, and spatial and temporal variations. In this study, several fish assemblages off the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean) were ecologically and morphologically analysed and compared. The morphological analysis was performed from body shape of fish species using geometric morphology. Moreover, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to analyse the effect of local environmental variables such as habitat, locality and depth on the composition and abundance of assemblages. The results revealed greater differences among assemblages in the clustering performed from morphological data, which is linked to habitat complexity, than those shown by the ecological analysis. Moreover, the CCA analysis indicated that type of substratum and the location significantly influenced the composition and structure of the fish assemblages. These results evidenced that morphology provides different and complementary information than ecological analysis because it allows to predict the ecological and functional habits of species within the community, helping to improve the understanding of the fish assemblages structure.

AB The application of trait-based approaches has become a widely applied tool to analyse community assembly processes and dynamics in phytoplankton communities. Its advantages include summarizing information of many species without losing essentials of the main driving processes. Here, we used trait-based approaches to study phytoplankton temporal succession in a subtropical reservoir. We applied a combined approach including morphological traits (i.e. volume, surface) and functional clustering of species (morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) and Reynolds' groups) and related the clustering of species with the environment. We found that this reservoir is characterized by a low richness and a bimodal distribution of phytoplankton biomass. Taxonomic and functional classifications were coincident, and the dominant species and groups biomasses were explained by the same group of variables. For instance, group X-2, MBFG V and Carteria sp. biomasses were explained by: pH, Secchi disk depth, N-NH4; while group B, MBFG VI and Cyclotella ocellata biomasses were explained by stability of the water column, incident solar radiation, Secchi disk depth and N-NH4. From our results, we state that functional and taxonomic classifications are complementary rather than opposed approaches, and their specific uses depend exclusively on the aim of the study and the characteristics of the environment under evaluation. Our work is the first description of phytoplankton dynamics in a reservoir in the arid central western Argentina (Cuyo region).

AB AimWe examined fish establishment trends in the aftermath of the connection of two Neotropical freshwater ecoregions. Darwin's conundrum was used to examine whether taxonomic and functional relatedness would explain establishment or whether the establishment of new populations was driven by ecological interactions (Darwin's naturalization hypothesis, DNH) or by shared environmental requirements (adaptation hypothesis, AH).
   LocationParana River, south-eastern South America.
   MethodsTaxonomic relatedness was investigated using a one-tailed Fisher exact test, considering all species and monophyletic groups. Functional traits were used to estimate niche dissimilarities among non-native species and across the entire set of native species, generating distributions that were fitted to exponential or logarithmic curves, based on a new conceptual model.
   ResultsOf the 213 species from the Lower Parana River that had the opportunity to reach the Upper Parana River, 25% - 53 spp. - were successfully established. The ratios of unshared to shared genera for both successful and unsuccessful non-native species were not different, but 7% of type I error probability for Characiformes and 8% for all species, would favour DNH. Our results indicate that both DNH and AH could explain successes but that DNH was more likely to explain failures in establishment.
   Main conclusionDarwin's naturalization hypothesis is more likely to explain the non-native establishment in invasion processes. Both the DNH and AH explain successful colonization, but DNH provided the best explanation for failed non-native establishments. Non-native species that were functionally similar to native species (i.e. with similar traits) were more likely to fail, suggesting that biotic resistance was directly linked to ecological similarity. Biotic resistance could be the most important mechanism for explaining establishment or failure of non-native species. The conceptual model proposed here can be used to predict which non-native species are least likely to establish, based on the functional traits of species in the native community.

AB Previous work has shown that the intertidal seagrass macrobenthos at three geographically and ecologically disparate localities (in the north-east Atlantic, south-west Indian and south-west Pacific Oceans) possess similar relative species occurrence distributions and uniform species densities. These common features are here demonstrated to be related to the presence in those assemblages of: (1) similar functional diversities and evennesses, (2) the same set of dominant component functional groups, and (3) similar ranked relative occurrence distributions both of those groups and of the component genera within each of the larger groups. The two lower-latitude systems were particularly similar in all these respects. Although sharing the same subset of individual functional groups, however, the relative importance of members of that subset varied from locality to locality and even within a single locality, whilst still maintaining the same ranked relative functional-group occurrence distribution. Therefore the broad structure of available macrobenthic functional roles and the relative occurrences of the component taxa in intertidal seagrass beds (and hence, granted stochastic assembly, the total numbers of taxa supported by unit area) are likely to be linked causally, although the form of the relationship is unclear.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 115, 114-126.

AB Tree leaves are interfaces between the whole organism and the environment. Leaves display a series of attributes that are linked to specific functions (functional leaf traits-FLT) and/or show responses to biotic and abiotic stress factors (stress response traits, SRT), which can be subdivided into: (a) morphological traits; (b) chemical traits; (c) physiological traits; (d) symptoms. The analysis of FLT is a useful tool for tree species and provenance phenotyping, due to the adaptation of trees to environmental stress. Additionally, FLT can be used as response factor in long term and large spatial scales surveys of forest conditions. Despite these potential benefits of leaf traits in the assessment of ecosystem health and functioning, leaf sampling in forests is time-consuming and costly, especially in forests with a complex vertical and horizontal structure and in remote forest areas. Once a foliar sample has been collected, many different analyses can be carried out; however, analyses should be technically simple and able to be performed within one day following the leaf collection (i.e., on fresh samples), or after air-drying the leaves themselves (analysis of dried specimens). This paper reports the results of leaf sampling and foliar analyses carried out in previous research projects and revises the current state-of-the-art. The leaf traits that are easily obtainable from leaf sampling are listed, together with the operational procedures necessary for their measurement, described in a standardized protocol. Their ecological and functional relevance is discussed in relation to their potential information (as indicators of climatic stress, drought, air and soil pollution, tree light-use and competition, plant nutritional status, health and general plant stress conditions). Finally, this review provides suggestions for the elaboration and reporting of data, and proposes some guidelines to improve the effectiveness of foliar analysis in the assessment of forest ecosystem health, properties and functioning.

AB Whilst the biological traits composition of invertebrate assemblages has been successfully used to monitor temperate rivers, it has been seldom tested in tropical areas. We compared the trait composition of Ephemeroptera assemblages (five traits, 21 modalities) in three categories of headwater streams of FG: reference (undisturbed) sites, sites formerly impacted by gold-mining, and sites currently impacted by gold-mining. Differences in macroinvertebrate assemblage according to environmental characteristics and disturbance were evaluated using correspondence analysis and MANOVA. Among the considered traits, food acquisition, respiration and locomotion detected both past and current disturbance associated with gold-mining in headwaters. A fuzzy correspondence analysis showed a significant segregation of currently gold-mined, formerly gold-mined, and reference sites according to species traits. Shifts in trait composition were mostly related to changes in assemblage composition. Interestingly, no significant decline in diversity indices was observed in formerly gold-mined sites compared to the reference sites, 2 years after abandonment, while the taxonomic and trait composition of communities changed at these sites. These results support the case for further fundamental quantification of species traits, and for the inclusion of sensitive, trait-related metrics in upcoming multimetric indices for the assessment of river health.

AB Ecomorphological adaptations represent the response of organisms to environmental factors during evolution. The jaw bones of three sympatric species of Chromis (Chromis notata, Chromis fumea and Chromis albicauda) were assessed using a geometric morphometric analysis, and were compared with prey composition as determined by stomach content analyses. According to a canonical variate analysis based on 48 landmarks, the three species show distinct differences in the premaxilla, dentary, angular, and retroarticular. They feed mainly on planktonic copepods, which represent ca. 90 % of their total diets; however, their diets slightly but significantly differ in the frequencies of occurrence of amphipods, euphausiids, mysids, decapods, and polychaetes. A comprehensive review indicates that the thick mandible of C. notata is an adaptive trait which confers the capability to feed on relatively harder prey items than does C. fumea, in which the mandible is less robust. However, the protrusive ability of the upper jaw in C. fumea is enhanced relative to that in C. notata and C. albicauda, because of a long ascending process in C. fumea. The long thin lower jaw of C. fumea is regarded as a morpho-functional adaption for effectively catching pelagic prey, such as planktonic copepod, in contrast to chewing and biting of prey. Our results firstly suggest evidence of prey partition for the sympatric three Chromis species (C. notata, C. fumea and C. albicauda) based on comparison between jaw bone structure and prey compostion, may help to understand evolutionary histories among species.

AB Environmental quality monitoring of water resources is challenged with providing the basis for safeguarding the environment against adverse biological effects of anthropogenic chemical contamination from diffuse and point sources. While current regulatory efforts focus on monitoring and assessing a few legacy chemicals, many more anthropogenic chemicals can be detected simultaneously in our aquatic resources. However, exposure to chemical mixtures does not necessarily translate into adverse biological effects nor clearly shows whether mitigation measures are needed. Thus, the question which mixtures are present and which have associated combined effects becomes central for defining adequate monitoring and assessment strategies. Here we describe the vision of the international, EU-funded project SOLUTIONS, where three routes are explored to link the occurrence of chemical mixtures at specific sites to the assessment of adverse biological combination effects. First of all, multi-residue target and non-target screening techniques covering a broader range of anticipated chemicals co-occurring in the environment are being developed. By improving sensitivity and detection limits for known bioactive compounds of concern, new analytical chemistry data for multiple components can be obtained and used to characterise priority mixtures. This information on chemical occurrence will be used to predict mixture toxicity and to derive combined effect estimates suitable for advancing environmental quality standards. Secondly, bioanalytical tools will be explored to provide aggregate bioactivity measures integrating all components that produce common (adverse) outcomes even for mixtures of varying compositions. The ambition is to provide comprehensive arrays of effect-based tools and trait-based field observations that link multiple chemical exposures to various environmental protection goals more directly and to provide improved in situ observations for impact assessment of mixtures. Thirdly, effect-directed analysis (EDA) will be applied to identify major drivers of mixture toxicity. Refinements of EDA include the use of statistical approaches with monitoring information for guidance of experimental EDA studies. These three approaches will be explored using case studies at the Danube and Rhine river basins as well as rivers of the Iberian Peninsula. The synthesis of findings will be organised to provide guidance for future solution-oriented environmental monitoring and explore more systematic ways to assess mixture exposures and combination effects in future water quality monitoring.

AB We investigated functional patterns of fish assemblages of two adjacent basins (Araguaia and Tocantins) to test whether their headwater stream fish assemblages are more functionally (dis)similar than expected by chance and whether these (dis)similarities are related to differences of environmental conditions between basins. We used an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) on a functional dissimilarity matrix to test for (dis)similarities between fish assemblages of both basins. We performed RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to determine fish species trait-environment relationship. Our results revealed functional dissimilarities between fish assemblages of both basins and significant species trait-environment relationships, suggesting that environmental conditions are driving such dissimilarities. Inter-basin dissimilarities are mainly driven by altitudinal and water temperature gradients, whereas dissimilarities among streams within the basins are influenced by channel depth, turbidity and conductivity. These five environmental variables mostly affected six fish species traits (body mass, water column position, substrate preference, parental care, foraging locality and migration) in different manners. This study is an attempt to understand functional trends of fish assemblages in a tropical region that remains poorly known but severely threatened.

AB We tested the hypothesis that streams in deforested areas shelter different fish communities to nearby forested areas, and that these disparities are due to environmental parameters that limit or benefit different species according to their functional traits. We compared the community composition of three south east Brazilian streams flanked by riparian forest with three nearby streams in deforested areas. The following functional traits were considered: diet, habitat use, water flow preference, size, and hypoxia tolerance. Differentiation between forested and deforested streams corresponded with the different contributions of three functional groups. Species reported in the literature to be hypoxia tolerant, and exhibiting a variable combination of the other traits prevailed in deforested streams, although we did not find substantial differences in oxygen levels between forested and deforested streams. In forested streams, benthic species associated with a high water flow and an insectivorous diet were dominant. Changes in streams induced by deforestation which are associated with habitat availability, food resources, and physicochemical conditions appear to restrict the occurrence of specialized species and instead benefit tolerant generalists.

AB Ecological integrity is an overarching concept that integrates multiple properties of ecosystems, including structure, function and resilience to external change. We explore the links between ecological integrity and structural surrogates for ecosystem functioning to develop a cost-effective assessment of Functional Integrity for marine habitats based on biological traits, abundance and heterogeneity, focused on the visible components of the sea-floor, i.e., epibenthic flora and fauna and seabed biogenic habitat features. The assessment was based on diversity and redundancy of functional traits of the identified benthic components, supplemented by estimates of spatial heterogeneity (habitat transitions) and vertical habitat complexity. This approach was developed using video data collected in different years with different sampling strategies in two locations: Kawau Bay in North Island of New Zealand, and Port Pegasus in Stewart Island, off South Island of New Zealand; this last location was a priori expected to be nearly pristine. Despite variability in sampling techniques and environmental settings, the approach proved effective and evidenced higher measures of Functional Integrity in the Port Pegasus location. This study introduces a first step to measure ecological integrity by successfully converting video data to surrogates of Functional Integrity, in a way expected to be habitat independent.

AB Alterations to ecosystem function due to reductions in species richness are predicted to increase as humans continue to affect the marine environment, especially in coastal areas, which serve as the interface between land and sea. The potential functional consequences due to reductions in species diversity have attracted considerable attention recently but little is known about the consequence of such loss in natural communities. We examined how the potential for function is affected by natural reductions in taxon richness using empirical (non-simulated) coastal marine benthic macrofaunal data from the Skagerrak-Baltic Sea region (N. Europe), where taxon richness decreases 25-fold, from 151 to 6 taxa. To estimate functional changes we defined multiple traits (10 traits and 51 categories) on which trait category richness, functional diversity (FD) and number of taxa per trait category were calculated. Our results show that decrease in taxon richness leads to an overall reduction in function but functional richness remains comparatively high even at the lowest level of taxon richness. Although the taxonomic reduction was sharp, up to 96% of total taxon richness, we identified both potential thresholds in functioning and subtler changes where function was maintained along the gradient. The functional changes were not only caused by reductions in taxa per trait category, some categories were maintained or even increased. Primarily, the reduction in species richness altered trait categories related to feeding, living and movement and thus potentially could have an effect on various ecosystem processes. This highlights the importance of recognising ecosystem multifunctionality, especially at low taxonomic richness. We also found that in this system rare species (singletons) did not stand for the functional complexities and changes. Our findings were consistent with theoretical and experimental predictions and suggest that a large proportion of the information about alterations of function is found in measures such as functional diversity and number of taxa per trait category.

AB The loss of species is known to have negative impacts on the integrity of ecosystems, but the details of this relationship are still far from being fully understood. This study investigates how the distribution patterns of polychaete species and their associated biological trait patterns in six Mediterranean coastal lagoons change under computationally simulated scenarios of random species loss. Species were progressively removed from the full polychaete assemblage and the similarity between the full assemblage and the reduced matrices of both species and trait patterns was calculated. The results indicate the magnitude of changes that might follow species loss in the real world, and allow consideration of the resistance of the system's functional capacity to loss of species, expressed through the species' biological traits as an approximation to functioning. Comparisons were made between the changes in the distribution of species and of traits, as well as between the six different lagoons. While the change of species and trait patterns was strongly correlated within most lagoons, different lagoons showed distinctly different patterns. In disturbed lagoons, the dominance of one or few species was the major driver for the observed patterns and the loss of these species caused extreme changes. Less disturbed lagoons were less susceptible to extreme changes and had a greater resistance towards species loss. Species richness appears to be less important for the ability of the lagoons to buffer changes, instead the initial composition of the assemblage and the identity of the lost species determine the response of the system and our ability to predict changes of the assemblage's functional potential.

AB A key challenge to progressing our understanding of biodiversity's role in the sustenance of ecosystem function is the extrapolation of the results of two decades of dedicated empirical research to regional, global and future landscapes. Ecosystem models provide a platform for this progression, potentially offering a holistic view of ecosystems where, guided by the mechanistic understanding of processes and their connection to the environment and biota, large-scale questions can be investigated. While the benefits of depicting biodiversity in such models are widely recognized, its application is limited by difficulties in the transfer of knowledge from small process oriented ecology into macro-scale modelling. Here, we build on previous work, breaking down key challenges of that knowledge transfer into a tangible framework, highlighting successful strategies that both modelling and ecology communities have developed to better interact with one another. We use a benthic and a pelagic case-study to illustrate how aspects of the links between biodiversity and ecosystem process have been depicted in marine ecosystem models (ERSEM and MIRO), from data, to conceptualisation and model development. We hope that this framework may help future interactions between biodiversity researchers and model developers by highlighting concrete solutions to common problems, and in this way contribute to the advance of the mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity in marine (and terrestrial) ecosystems.

AB Diverse alien and native floras of the same region provide a good opportunity to test the influence of environmental variables in structuring of plant assemblages because both can be considered as a replicates of the assembly process under identical conditions but with different dispersal capabilities. We performed this test within 11 floristically diverse areas forming the strictly defined Valley of River Volga (SE Russia), for the first time treating native and non-native floras as independent replicates of the assembly process. We used a popular biogeographical method, parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) to estimate both non-random components and the relationships of plant assemblages. We compared patterns of relationships obtained among plant assemblages based on (1) over 1000 presumably native, and (2) over 250 presumably non-native species of the same assemblage and found that the PAE cladograms based on (1) presumably native and (2) presumably non-native species of the same assemblage were topologically identical. The obtained patterns of relationships among plant assemblages were almost fully congruent with the climatic variables. The assembly processes of native and alien assemblages occurred in strikingly similar ways and therefore are not random. Climate and soil, but not dispersal limitation explained better the relationships among plant assemblages.

AB Relationships between morphological traits and their ecological function frequently result in patterns that are consistently observed within taxa. Across fishes, the field of ecomorphology has identified a number of morphological traits linked to foraging tactic. Here we examined the links between morphology and diet in pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus (L., 1758)) from three temperate freshwater lakes. We focused on morphological variation in pharyngeal jaw and gill raker structures, both involved with the processing of prey after capture, in relation to diet. Using stomach contents and stable isotope analysis, we established mean resource use estimates for both populations and individual fish. Among populations and individuals within lakes, we observed that pharyngeal jaw size and gill raker spacing increased with the consumption of littoral prey (e.g., hard-shelled snails) relative to pelagic prey (e.g., zooplankton), but the morphological changes were greater for the pharyngeal jaws. Overall, the relationships that we observed between morphology and foraging tactic were consistent with patterns observed in pumpkinseed and across other fishes. Individual-level diet variation associated with morphology may result in phenotypic diversity within populations that has multiple ecological and evolutionary implications for these populations.

AB Fire suppression throughout the 20th century greatly altered plant communities in fire-dominated systems across North America. Our ability to assess these effects over the long term, however, is handicapped by the paucity of baseline data. Here, we used detailed baseline data from the 1950s to track changes in the over-and understory composition of pine-barrens vegetation growing on sandy, glacial lake-bed sediments in central Wisconsin. We expected fire suppression to favor succession to closed-canopy conditions, leading to decreases in shade-intolerant and fire-adapted species and consequent reductions in alpha and gamma diversity. We also expected beta diversity to decline due to increases in shade-tolerant, fire-sensitive, and exotic species. In fact, fire suppression has greatly altered the structure and composition of these pine-barrens communities over the past 54 years. Woody, wind-pollinated, and shade-tolerant species all increased in richness and abundance, as expected, with succession following fire suppression. Contrary to expectations, local and regional species richness increased by 12% and 26%, respectively, while Shannon beta diversity declined 24.1%. Increases in canopy coverage and number of native species appear to have driven this biotic homogenization. In contrast, increases in exotic species in our study did not promote biotic homogenization, reflecting their relative rarity across sites. Our findings highlight the key role fire plays in shaping the assembly of these pine-barrens communities.

AB Although trait information has been widely used to explore underlying mechanisms of forest community structure, most studies have focused on local patterns of phylogenetic or functional alpha diversity. Investigations of functional beta diversity, on the other hand, have not been conducted at local scales in a spatially explicit way. In this study, we provide a powerful methodology based on recent advances in spatial point pattern analysis using fully mapped data of large and small trees in two large temperate forest plots. This approach allowed us to assess the relative importance of different ecological processes and mechanisms for explaining patterns of local phylogenetic and functional beta diversity. For both forests and size classes, we found a clear hierarchy of scales: habitat filtering accounted for patterns of phylogenetic and functional beta diversity at larger distances (150-250 m), dispersal limitation accounted for the observed decline in beta diversity at distances below 150 m, and species interactions explained small departures from functional and phylogenetic beta diversity at the immediate plant-neighborhood scale (below 20 m). Thus, both habitat filtering and dispersal limitation influenced the observed patterns in phylogenetic and functional beta diversity at local scales. This result contrasts with a previous study from the same forests, where dispersal limitation alone approximated the observed species beta diversity for distances up to 250 m. In addition, species interactions were relatively unimportant for predicting phylogenetic and functional beta diversity. Our analysis suggests that phylogenetic and functional beta diversity can provide insights into the mechanisms of local community assembly that are missed by studies focusing exclusively on species beta diversity.

AB The tenet that ecological adaptation can lead to recurrent ecomorphological trends resulting from repetitive processes has long been a primary topic of investigation in evolutionary ecology. To explore this aspect further, this study provides an analysis of the morphological diversity in chondrostoms (Cyprinidae). This freshwater fish group shows a tendency towards bottom-feeding specialization, which has led to evolutionary innovations in body and mouth shape traits, which are currently used for the classification of genera. Body, lower lip (LL) and corner ray shape were analysed for nine species in total. Allometric relationships among the three morphometric traits were considered to be responsible for LL shape variability and there was significant covariation between LL and body shape, which reflected habitat use. Smaller and opportunistic-feeding species inhabiting stream or small-sized rivers were characterized by a deeper body (increased feeding maneuverability), an arched LL and a terminal mouth position. Conversely, larger and diet-specialized species were characterized by a fusiform body (increased swimming performance), a straight LL and an inframouth position on an elongated snout (optimized bottom feeding). The results suggest that interspecific mouth shape variability may have originated from two types of deformation' processes, both leading to a straight mouth shape and acting either jointly or independently. Also, given the plesiomorphic state of several of the species under study, the specialization towards a benthic lifestyle in chondrostoms from different phylogenetic lineages is thought to have occurred repeatedly to overcome a number of functional constraints, including foraging efficiency and swimming performance.

AB In this study, we investigated functional structure patterns of tropical headwater and river fish assemblages. We hypothesised that environmental conditions are primarily structuring headwater streams leading to functionally clustered assemblages, whereas processes that favour functional overdispersion would guide river assemblages. For 27 headwater streams and 22 rivers, we used eight functional traits for calculating two functional indexes: mean pairwise distance (MPD) and net relatedness index (NRI). We performed linear regressions between indexes and species richness, a multiple regression between NRI and eight environmental variables and a variation partitioning to disentangle the role of environment and space on NRI. Our findings indicate that fish assemblages of headwaters are structured by environmental conditions as most assemblages in this habitat displayed a tendency to clustering and MPD/NRI were not correlated with species diversity, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for river habitat. Four environmental variables (channel depth, water velocity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity) explain 56% of functional structure variation. These variables seem to function as selective filters in headwaters, whereas channel depth may be determinant for functional overdispersion of river fish assemblages. Components associated with space are also influencing the functional structure. Limitations of species dispersal through space (between both habitat types) appear as a possible cause to this. In this sense, both environmental conditions and processes linked with space are capable of influencing the functional structure of tropical headwater streams and river fish assemblages.

AB In most biodiversity studies, taxonomic diversity is the measure for the multiplicity of species and is often considered to represent functional diversity. However, trends in taxonomic diversity and functional diversity may differ, for example, when many functionally similar but taxonomically different species co-occur in a community. The differences between these diversity measures are of particular interest in diversity research for understanding diversity patterns and their underlying mechanisms. We analysed a temporally highly resolved 20-year time series of lake phytoplankton to determine whether taxonomic diversity and functional diversity exhibit similar or contrasting seasonal patterns. We also calculated the functional mean of the community in n-dimensional trait space for each sampling day to gain further insights into the seasonal dynamics of the functional properties of the community. We found an overall weak positive relationship between taxonomic diversity and functional diversity with a distinct seasonal pattern. The two diversity measures showed synchronous behaviour from early spring to mid-summer and a more complex and diverging relationship from autumn to late winter. The functional mean of the community exhibited a recurrent annual pattern with the most prominent changes before and after the clear-water phase. From late autumn to winter, the functional mean of the community and functional diversity were relatively constant while taxonomic diversity declined, suggesting competitive exclusion during this period. A further decline in taxonomic diversity concomitant with increasing functional diversity in late winter to early spring is seen as a result of niche diversification together with competitive exclusion. Under these conditions, several different sets of traits are suitable to thrive, but within one set of functional traits only one, or very few, morphotypes can persist. Taxonomic diversity alone is a weak descriptor of trait diversity in phytoplankton. However, the combined analysis of taxonomic diversity and functional diversity, along with the functional mean of the community, allows for deeper insights into temporal patterns of community assembly and niche diversification.

AB Divergent selection along environmental gradients connecting locally restricted extreme habitats and adjacent benign habitats can shape convergent evolution of traits involved in coping with physiochemical stressors and can drive speciation. At the same time, the presence of such stressors alters aspects of the biotic environment, including resource availability and competitive regimes. However, it remains unclear whether and how the ecology of populations occurring in both extreme and benign environments varies in a predictable fashion. We investigated the trophic ecology of live-bearing fishes of the genus Poecilia that have independently colonised multiple springs containing toxic hydrogen sulphide in southern Mexico. Sulphide spring fish are adapted to the unique environmental conditions and are reproductively isolated from ancestral populations in adjacent non-sulphidic habitats. We used gut content analyses to test whether colonisation of extreme habitats was accompanied by shifts of trophic resource use and expansions of trophic niche width. Furthermore, we tested whether dietary shifts were reflected in trophic morphology by comparing intestinal tract lengths among populations using both wild-caught and common garden-raised individuals. Gut content analyses revealed that fish inhabiting toxic springs expanded their trophic niche width and changed their dietary resource use from detritus and algae to sulphide bacteria and invertebrates. This dietary shift was paralleled by changes in intestinal tract morphology, whereby sulphide spring fish had shorter intestines than fish from adjacent non-sulphidic habitats. Analysis of common garden-raised fish indicated that morphological differences between sulphidic and non-sulphidic populations are at least in part due to genetic differentiation. Both patterns of trophic resource use and differentiation in trophic morphology were consistent across replicated pairs of sulphidic and non-sulphidic populations, although the magnitude of differentiation varied among river drainages. Our results suggest that colonisation of and adaptation to sulphide springs in southern Mexico was paralleled by convergent changes in trophic ecology. This highlights the complexity of environmental gradients and the necessity of considering multiple sources of selection when studying the evolution of complex phenotypes.

AB Changing climate extremes and invasion by non-native species are two of the most prominent threats to native faunas. Predicting the relationships between global change and native faunas requires a quantitative toolkit that effectively links the timing and magnitude of extreme events to variation in species abundances. Here, we examine how discharge anomalies - unexpected floods and droughts - determine covariation in abundance of native and non-native fish species in a highly variable desert river in Arizona. We quantified stochastic variation in discharge using Fourier analyses on >15000 daily observations. We subsequently coupled maximum annual spectral anomalies with a 15-year time series of fish abundances (1994-2008), using Multivariate Autoregressive State-Space (MARSS) models. Abiotic drivers (discharge anomalies) were paramount in determining long-term fish abundances, whereas biotic drivers (species interactions) played only a secondary role. As predicted, anomalous droughts reduced the abundances of native species, while floods increased them. However, in contrast to previous studies, we observed that the non-native assemblage was surprisingly unresponsive to extreme events. Biological trait analyses showed that functional uniqueness was higher in native than in non-native fishes. We also found that discharge anomalies influenced diversity patterns at the meta-community level, with nestedness increasing after anomalous droughts due to the differential impairment of native species. Overall, our results advance the notion that discharge variation is key in determining community trajectories in the long term, predicting the persistence of native fauna even in the face of invasion. We suggest this variation, rather than biotic interactions, may commonly underlie covariation between native and non-native faunas, especially in highly variable environments. If droughts become increasingly severe due to climate change, and floods increasingly muted due to regulation, fish assemblages in desert rivers may become taxonomically and functionally impoverished and dominated by non-native taxa.

AB Cichlid fishes are hypothesized to encompass several independent adaptive radiations that display increased diversification rates and impressive ecological heterogeneity. Here, I review major ecological patterns associated with the evolutionary history of cichlids, with particular focus on comparison of Afrotropical and Neotropical lineages. Specifically, I present major patterns of ecological diversification, potential mechanisms that may promote ecological diversification, and possible consequences of ecological diversification. Evolutionary convergence and specialization of ecological (e.g., diet), behavioral (e.g., benthic sifting), and morphological traits (e.g., oral dentition) characterize adaptive patterns that transcend continents. Craniofacial mechanics, the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, phenotypic plasticity, and hybridization may have facilitated diversification of cichlid fishes by generating functional, morphological, and/or genetic diversity. The benthic-pelagic axis has been an important source of divergence during adaptive radiation. Additionally, there are several discrepancies between Afrotropical and Neotropical lineages, such as the relative frequency of herbivorous species, the importance of hybridization in generating diversity, the relative frequency of dentition types, and relationships between dental organization and ecological function. Emphasis on contrasts between Neotropical and Afrotropical lineages improves characterization of patterns at a broader level of organization and indicates that the genetic basis, functional capacity, and ecological opportunity for many traits may be conserved across lineages.

AB Pimelodella taenioptera Miranda Ribeiro, 1914 and Imparfinis schubarti (Gomes, 1956) are two of the most common fish species in Bodoquena Plateau streams, Paraguay basin. These species have benthic habits and subaquatical observations suggested that they present differentiation in their preference for mesohabitat types. Pimelodella taenioptera shows preference for slow waters, such as pools, while I. schubarti is associated to riffles. In this study we investigated if the known patterns of mesohabitat use of?. taenioptera and I. schubarti can be predict by their ecomorphological and trophic traits. We described the dietary habits and ecomorphological attributes of? taenioptera and I. schubarti individuals, captured in the Parque Nacional da Serra da Bodoquena (PNSB), Mato Grosso do Sul state, central Brazil. Pimelodella taenioptera presented a more generalist diet, consuming a total of 23 different food items. Imparfinis schubarti have a diet based exclusively on aquatic insects. The ecomorphological analysis revealed that the species differed in relation to five morphological traits associated to habitat use (p<0.01). The results of this study reveal a clear functional dissimilarity between P. taenioptera and I. shubarti. The observed trophic and ecomorphological patterns are congruent with the known habitat use for these species and probably reflect the spatial and temporal variability on conditions and resources present in riffles and pools. Therefore, as expected, the morphological and feeding attributes represent predictive information related to mesohabitat use.

AB The factors regulating phytoplankton community composition play a crucial role in structuring aquatic food webs. However, consensus is still lacking about the mechanisms underlying the observed biogeographical differences in cell size composition of phytoplankton communities. Here we use a trait-based model to disentangle these mechanisms in two contrasting regions of the Atlantic Ocean. In our model, the phytoplankton community can self-assemble based on a trade-off emerging from relationships between cell size and (1) nutrient uptake, (2) zooplankton grazing, and (3) phytoplankton sinking. Grazing 'pushes' the community towards larger cell sizes, whereas nutrient uptake and sinking 'pull' the community towards smaller cell sizes. We find that the stable environmental conditions of the tropics strongly balance these forces leading to persistently small cell sizes and reduced size diversity. In contrast, the seasonality of the temperate region causes the community to regularly reorganize via shifts in species composition and to exhibit, on average, bigger cell sizes and higher size diversity than in the tropics. Our results raise the importance of environmental variability as a key structuring mechanism of plankton communities in the ocean and call for a reassessment of the current understanding of phytoplankton diversity patterns across latitudinal gradients.

AB Nonindigenous aquatic species are becoming increasingly common in coastal and inland waters, largely due to the global transport of zooplankton via commercial shipping and recreational boating. The cost of mitigation and lost income due to invasive zooplankton is estimated in the billions of dollars annually, yet we know little about the temporal dynamics of these invaders. Analysis of an 8.5-year (June 2005-December 2013) zooplankton time series from the Columbia River revealed contrasting patterns of invasion dynamics between species, cyclical periods of community invasion, and key environmental variables that constrain populations of invasive zooplankton. We identified four seasonal zooplankton communities (autumn/invaded, winter/barren, spring/rotifer, and transitional) that are strongly correlated with changes in chlorophyll content and water temperature, with peak abundances of invasive zooplankters occurring during periods of maximum water temperature. Additionally, we observed contrasting patterns of phenology between persistent and ephemeral invasive populations, with successful invaders exhibiting delayed annual peaks in population abundance. Two invasive zooplanktersthe copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi and larval Asian clam Corbicula flumineadominate the zooplankton community in late summer and early autumn. Likewise, our results support conclusions from a growing body of literature that delayed phenology may be a key functional trait for successful invaders.

AB Over the past decade, studies of the effects of consumer-driven nutrient dynamics have become more common. This work has demonstrated that animals can function as sources and sinks of elements, but few studies have broadly compared these processes among organisms and across ecosystems. Collectively, the articles in this special issue elucidate the important roles that organisms can play in nutrient dynamics in lotic, lentic and wetland ecosystems. These papers show how species-specific traits, such as body stoichiometry and trophic ecology, and abiotic variables, including ambient water chemistry, govern the net impacts of consumer-driven nutrient dynamics in freshwater ecosystems. Globally, the introduction of non-native species and the loss of native biodiversity compromise the functional integrity of freshwater ecosystems. The work featured in this issue will help ecologists and conservation biologists integrate species-specific traits with ecosystem-specific conditions to understand the potential effects of changing biodiversity on ecosystem function in fresh waters.

AB Mining impacts on stream systems have historically been studied over small spatial scales, yet investigations over large areas may be useful for characterizing mining as a regional source of stress to stream fishes. The associations between co-occurring stream fish assemblages and densities of various "classes" of mining occurring in the same catchments were tested using threshold analysis. Threshold analysis identifies the point at which fish assemblages change substantially from best available habitat conditions with increasing disturbance. As this occurred over large regions, species comprising fish assemblages were represented by various functional traits as well as other measures of interest to management (characterizing reproductive ecology and life history, habitat preferences, trophic ecology, assemblage diversity and evenness, tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance and state-recognized game species). We used two threshold detection methods: change-point analysis with indicator analysis and piecewise linear regression. We accepted only those thresholds that were highly statistically significant (p <= 0.01) for both techniques and overlapped within <5% error. We found consistent, wedge-shaped declines in multiple fish metrics with increasing levels of mining in catchments, suggesting mines are a regional source of disturbance. Threshold responses were consistent across the three ecoregions occurring at low mine densities. For 47.2% of the significant thresholds, a density of only <= 0.01 mines/km(2) caused a threshold response. In fact, at least 25% of streams in each of our three study ecoregions have mine densities in their catchments with the potential to affect fish assemblages. Compared to other anthropogenic impacts assessed over large areas (agriculture, impervious surface or urban land use), mining had a more pronounced and consistent impact on fish assemblages.

AB In dryland regions, increased demand for water has led to the reduction of natural aquatic habitats and threatens persisting aquatic habitats. In the Madrean Sky Islands (MSI), water demands have also resulted in the creation of novel aquatic habitats, including stock ponds. Stock ponds are important surrogate habitat for native species, yet little is known about the aquatic invertebrates utilizing these habitats. Additionally, stock ponds support non-native vertebrate predators including American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeiana) and Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), and the effects of these predators on invertebrate communities in stock ponds are unknown. We explored similarities in invertebrate communities in stream pools and stock ponds and compared aquatic invertebrate community composition, abundance, and richness in stock ponds with and without non-native predators. We found that despite considerable functional (trait-based) overlap in aquatic invertebrate communities, a large majority (81%) of taxa were exclusive to either stock ponds or stream pools. Additionally, we observed few differences in aquatic invertebrate community composition, abundance, and richness in stock ponds with and without non-native predators. We discuss ecological implications of our observations, limitations of our approach, and the importance of future work in determining the role of stock ponds in conservation of the region's aquatic invertebrates.

AB Background: Central American crater lake cichlid fish of the Midas species complex (Amphilophus spp.) are a model system for sympatric speciation and fast ecological diversification and specialization. Midas cichlids have been intensively analyzed from an ecological and morphological perspective. Genomic resources such as transcriptomic and genomic data sets, and a high-quality draft genome are available now. Many ecologically relevant species-specific traits and differences such as pigmentation and cranial morphology arise during development. Detailed descriptions of the early development of the Midas cichlid in particular, will help to investigate the ontogeny of species differences and adaptations.
   Results: We describe the embryonic and larval development of the crater lake cichlid, Amphilophus xiloaensis, until seven days after fertilization. Similar to previous studies on teleost development, we describe six periods of embryogenesis -the zygote, cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, and post-hatching period. Furthermore, we define homologous stages to well-described teleost models such as medaka and zebrafish, as well as other cichlid species such as the Nile tilapia and the South American cichlid Cichlasoma dimerus. Key morphological differences between the embryos of Midas cichlids and other teleosts are highlighted and discussed, including the presence of adhesive glands and different early chromatophore patterns, as well as variation in developmental timing.
   Conclusions: The developmental staging of the Midas cichlid will aid researchers in the comparative investigation of teleost ontogenies. It will facilitate comparative developmental biological studies of Neotropical and African cichlid fish in particular. In the past, the species flocks of the African Great Lakes have received the most attention from researchers, but some lineages of the 300-400 species of Central American lakes are fascinating model systems for adaptive radiation and rapid phenotypic evolution. The availability of genetic resources, their status as a model system for evolutionary research, and the possibility to perform functional experiments including transgenesis makes the Midas cichlid complex a very attractive model for evolutionary-developmental research.

AB Background: As ectothermic organisms have evolved to differing aquatic climates, the molecular basis of thermal adaptation is a key area of research. In this study, we tested for differential transcriptional response of ecologically divergent populations of redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) that have evolved in desert and montane climates. Each pure strain and their F1 cross were reared in a common garden environment and exposed over four weeks to diel water temperatures that were similar to those experienced in desert climates within the species' range. Gill tissues were collected from the three strains of fish (desert, montane, F1 crosses) at the peak of heat stress and tested for mRNA expression differences across the transcriptome with RNA-seq.
   Results: Strong differences in transcriptomic response to heat stress were observed across strains confirming that fish from desert environments have evolved diverse mechanisms to cope with stressful environments. As expected, a large number of total transcripts (12,814) were differentially expressed in the study (FDR <= 0.05) with 2310 transcripts in common for all three strains, but the desert strain had a larger number of unique differentially expressed transcripts (2875) than the montane (1982) or the F1 (2355) strain. Strongly differentiated genes (>4 fold change and FDR <= 0.05) were particularly abundant in the desert strain (824 unique contigs) relative to the other two strains (montane = 58; F1 = 192).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated patterns of acclimation (i.e., phenotypic plasticity) within strains and evolutionary adaptation among strains in numerous genes throughout the transcriptome. Key stress response genes such as molecular chaperones (i.e., heat shock proteins) had adaptive patterns of gene expression among strains, but also a much higher number of metabolic and cellular process genes were differentially expressed in the desert strain demonstrating these biological pathways are critical for thermal adaptation to warm aquatic climates. The results of this study further elucidate the molecular basis for thermal adaptation in aquatic ecosystems and extend the potential for identifying genes that may be critical for adaptation to changing climates.

AB In experimental systems, it has been shown that biodiversity indices based on traits or phylogeny can outperform species richness as predictors of plant ecosystem function. However, it is unclear whether this pattern extends to the function of food webs in natural ecosystems. Here we tested whether zooplankton functional and phylogenetic diversity explains the functioning of 23 natural pond communities. We used two measures of ecosystem function: (1) zooplankton community biomass and (2) phytoplankton abundance (Chl a). We tested for diversity-ecosystem function relationships within and across trophic levels. We found a strong correlation between zooplankton diversity and ecosystem function, whereas local environmental conditions were less important. Further, the positive diversity- ecosystem function relationships were more pronounced for measures of functional and phylogenetic diversity than for species richness. Zooplankton and phytoplankton biomass were best predicted by different indices, suggesting that the two functions are dependent upon different aspects of diversity. Zooplankton community biomass was best predicted by zooplankton trait-based functional richness, while phytoplankton abundance was best predicted by zooplankton phylogenetic diversity. Our results suggest that the positive relationship between diversity and ecosystem function can extend across trophic levels in natural environments, and that greater insight into variation in ecosystem function can be gained by combining functional and phylogenetic diversity measures.

AB The species interaction and their biological traits (BT) determine the function of benthic communities and, hence, the delivery of ecosystem services. Therefore, disturbance of benthic communities by trawling may compromise ecosystem service delivery, including fisheries' catches. In this work, we explore 1) the impact of trawling activities on benthic functional components (after the BTA approach) and 2) how trawling impact may affect the ecosystem services delivered by benthic communities. To this aim, we assessed the provision of ecosystem services by adopting the concept of Ecosystem Service Providers (ESP), i.e. ecological units that perform ecosystem functions that will ultimately deliver ecosystem services. We studied thirteen sites subjected to different levels of fishing effort in the Mediterranean. From a range of environmental variables included in the study, we found ESPs to be mainly affected by fishing effort and grain size. Our results suggested that habitat type has significant effects on the distribution of ESPs and this natural variability influences ESP response to trawling at a specific site. In order to summarize the complex relationships between human uses, ecosystem components and the demand for ecosystem services in trawling grounds, we adapted a DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State Change-Impact-Response) framework to the study area, emphasizing the role of society as Drivers of change and actors demanding management Responses. This integrative framework aims to inform managers about the interactions between all the elements involved in the management of trawling grounds, highlighting the need for an integrated approach in order to ensure ecosystem service provision.

AB Sequencing of RT-PCR amplified osteopontin (OPN) gene of buffalo mammary gland revealed its ORF to be of 843 nucleotides, coding for 280 amino acids long protein. Sequence comparison with cattle, sheep and pig showed 4 buffalo specific nucleotide changes. Two additional triplet nucleotides 273ACG275 and 681CAA683 in buffalo OPN as compared to cattle resulted in insertion of 2 amino acids N95 and N227. Phylogenetic analysis based on both nucleotides and amino acids sequence showed buffalo grouping more close to cattle and pig being placed most distantly from other 3 livestock species. Most of functional domains were conserved in buffalo OPN except that one of the 4 chymosin cleavage sites reported in cattle was missing in buffalo. Expression analysis of osteopontin gene by real-time PCR revealed approximately 5 fold increase in lactating buffalo mammary gland as compared to non-lactating, indicating its importance in milk production.

AB Pedaliaceae and Martyniaceae are Old World and New World families occurring primarily in arid environments with some taxa exhibiting similar adaptations to dispersal by large animals. Their taxonomic histories have also been intertwined, since they have often been combined as one family (e.g. Pedaliaceae). The temperate Asian aquatic plant Trapella was also assigned to Pedaliaceae, based on fruits with similar dispersal traits. With expanded sampling of both families, including Trapella, and data from ndhF, trnLF, and ETS sequences, this study confirms that the two families are distinct lineages, identifies a new placement for Trapella in tribe Gratioleae (Plantaginaceae s. l.), and shows that the two families exhibit a combination of shared floral morphology due to their proximity in Lamiales, and convergent functional morphology for dispersal. The phylogeny indicates the three tribes of Pedaliaceae are monophyletic, but that Sesamum is not.

AB River floodplains are important for their biodiversity and productivity, yet are considered one of the most threatened ecosystem types. Due to increasing awareness of the ecosystem services provided by floodplains, their restoration and reconnection with the main channels have become core topics in policy, management and science. In one of the last remaining alluvial forests at the upper Danube River, a new secondary floodplain channel was artificially created in 2010 using a nature-orientated construction scheme. The objective of this study was to analyze the colonization and succession of the fish community in the new floodplain river and the adjacent temporarily connected floodplain habitats over a period of four years. Following the restoration-induced changes in habitat morphology and availability of habitat space, a very fast initial colonization was observed, with 46% of the source species pool of the Danube present in the study area after only two months. Colonization by fishes was explained by habitat features such as habitat morphology as well as biological features such as the species inventory of the source habitat and life-history traits. The time span required for developing functional demographic structures could be explained by the degree of specialization in different life stages, with faster population development in species with high ecological plasticity. The high representation of small individuals in multiple fish species indicates the importance of the artificial floodplain channel as habitat for early life stages. Consequently, the new floodplain channel seems to at least partly mitigate the habitat loss in the main river. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrologic processes interact with geomorphic patterns to create the spatial and temporal variation in riverine habitat that affects the distribution of aquatic species throughout stream networks. The process domains concept (PDC) states that longitudinally-abrupt changes in geomorphic processes along streams determine temporal patterns of natural disturbance that influence the distribution of stream organisms. Despite its potential generality, the PDC has been applied primarily to mountain streams of western North America. We tested the utility of the PDC as a conceptual framework for characterizing spatiotemporal variability in abiotic conditions and assessed the influence of process domains (PDs) on community composition of fishes and mussels along a fifth order river mainstem in the gulf coastal plain of the southeastern United States. We measured channel cross sections at three transects nested within three sites nested within three stream reaches to quantify multi-scale spatial variability in channel geomorphology along the mainstem of the Neches River, Texas, USA. Next, we modeled stage-dependent channel hydraulics to quantify temporal variability in habitat area and benthic disturbance. Lastly, we sampled fishes and mussels at each site and tested whether PDs correlate with spatial variation in taxonomic and functional community composition. Channel cross-sectional dimensions varied at the reach scale and affected the modeled temporal variability in habitat area and benthic disturbance. This interaction between channel geomorphology and disturbance regime indicated the presence of distinct PDs at the reach scale. Taxonomic composition of fishes did not differ among reaches, whereas abundance and richness of mussels were strongly reduced in the upper reach compared to the middle and lower reaches. Only slight differences in functional traits of fishes and mussels were apparent among reaches, suggesting that reach scale PDs do not influence community composition via the filtering of these functional traits. This study provides empirical evidence that the PDC is a useful framework for describing hydrogeomorphic conditions and mussel abundance and richness and can guide channel restorations in streams draining regions of low topography.

AB Biodiversity in stream networks is threatened globally by interactions between habitat fragmentation and altered hydrologic regimes. In the Great Plains of North America, stream networks are fragmented by >19000 anthropogenic barriers, and flow regimes are altered by surface water retention and groundwater extraction. We documented the distribution of anthropogenic barriers and dry stream segments in five basins covering the central Great Plains to assess effects of broad-scale environmental change on stream fish community structure and distribution of reproductive guilds. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank competing models in which fragmentation, discharge magnitude, and percentage of time streams had zero flow (a measure of desiccation) were included to predict effects of environmental alterations on the distribution of fishes belonging to different reproductive guilds. Fragmentation caused by anthropogenic barriers was most common in the eastern Great Plains, but stream desiccation became more common to the west, where rivers are underlain by the depleted (i.e., extraction > recharge) High Plains Aquifer. Longitudinal gradients in fragmentation and desiccation contributed to spatial shifts in community structure from taxonomically and functionally diverse communities dominated by pelagic reproductive guilds where fragmentation and desiccation were least, to homogenized communities dominated by benthic guilds where fragmentation and desiccation were common. Modeling results revealed these shifts were primarily associated with decline of pelagic reproductive guilds, notably small-bodied pelagophilic and lithopelagophilic fishes that declined in association with decreased fragment length and increased number of days with zero flow. Graph theory combined with a barrier prioritization approach revealed specific fragments that could be reconnected to allow fishes within these guilds to colonize currently unoccupied fragments with the mitigation or removal of small dams (<10 m height). These findings are useful for natural resource managers charged with halting or reversing the prevailing pattern of declining fish diversity in the Great Plains. Our study represents one of the most comprehensive assessments of fish diversity responses to broad-scale environmental change in the Great Plains and provides a conservation strategy for addressing the simultaneous contributions of fragmentation and flow alteration to the global freshwater biodiversity crisis.

AB The objective of this paper is to determine the alteration of the taxonomic composition and functional structure of macroinvertebrate community associated with a massive growth of the invasive algae Didymosphenia geminata downstream of a mountain reservoir (Pajares Reservoir, La Rioja, Northern Spain). As the massive growth of the alga disappears a few kilometres downstream of the reservoir associated with the input of nutrients from a nearby village sewage, we may compare the community composition between nine stations in three different conditions: three stations heavily affected by the presence of D. geminata, three further downstream stations without the algal massive growth but affected by river regulation and three control stations (unregulated and without the algae). Results show a significant disturbance of the composition and structure of macroinvertebrate community in sites affected by the stream flow regulation downstream of the dam compared with unregulated streams, but the alterations are more dramatic in the area where the growth of D. geminata is massive because of the total substrate occupation by the algal filaments. Scrapers and others invertebrates living on the coarse substrate are especially affected at such sites. Moreover, an important increase in the relative abundance of chironomids is associated with the algal massive growth, especially in case of Eukiefferiella devonica and Cricotopus spp., reducing the assemblage diversity and leading to the taxonomic and functional homogenization of the community. Changes in the reservoir management (such as releasing the water from surface rather than from the hypolimnion) may be useful to control the massive growth of D. geminata and thus reducing the effects of river regulation on macroinvertebrate assemblage composition.

AB Using macroinvertebrates as ecological indicators for different stressors has a long tradition. However, when applied to field data, one often observes correlations between different macroinvertebrate indices that can be attributed to both correlations of stressors and inherent correlations due to the sensitivity of taxa to different stressors. Ignoring the source of any given correlation leads to ambiguous conclusions about the impact of different stressors.
   Here, we demonstrate how to distinguish the causes of correlation by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We assessed to which degree trait-based indices are stressor-specific and whether this depends on the pool of taxa and its taxonomic resolution. Therefore, we (1) analysed the frequencies of "sensitive" and "insensitive" taxa for pairwise combinations of different indices, (2) analysed the inherent correlation of indices with random samples from different taxon pools derived from field samples and from a complete species list of a whole ecoregion, and (3) compared this inherent correlation with the actual correlation of the field samples. We exemplified this approach by analysing two existing indices (SPEAR(pesticides), Saprobic Index) and new indices for temperature, flow and pH stress. We used these new indices to illustrate our approach while in-depth testing of their applicability was not the focus of our study.
   We found strong correlations between several indices in our study area at the Swiss Plateau. The probability that this correlation is only due to inherent correlation in the taxa sensitivities was low (maximum of 0.34). The problem of inherent correlation between indices is more severe for the smaller taxon pool with lower taxonomic resolution.
   Correlation in the sensitivity of different taxa to different stressors leads to an inherent correlation in trait-based indices, which weakens their explanatory power. Our results highlight the importance of correlation analyses when using trait-based indices to guide ecosystem-management, especially in regions with reduced biodiversity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Dispersal is a major determinant of connectivity between communities that may modulate the importance of environmental and spatial processes on taxonomic composition. While wind is likely to influence transport distance, rate and direction for numerous species, its effects on community composition remain poorly understood. Using eigenvector-based spatial analyses, we investigated the influence of wind flows, estimated by mesoscale models, on the spatial structure of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages with contrasting flying abilities in high Andean wetlands (26-32 degrees S). We further quantified the relative importance of local and regional processes through a variation partitioning approach. The influence of environmental heterogeneity was prevalent and of relatively similar amplitude in both flying and non-flying assemblages. Significant spatial structure more strongly driven by wind flows than by Euclidean schemes was detected for both assemblages. As expected, the highest levels of spatial structure were observed for the flying macroinvertebrate assemblage and they occurred at a much larger spatial scale in this group, suggesting a greater dispersal aptitude of the flying taxa. Our results show that environmental effects are predominant in shaping the spatial structure of macroinvertebrate communities in high Andean wetlands, as generally found in other systems. They also demonstrate the significance of wind flows in regulating high-altitude wetland macroinvertebrate communities and illustrate the importance of considering adequate spatial models and biological characteristics of species to advance our understanding of community patterns.

AB The idea behind multimetric indices is to integrate information from several metrics to provide a general classification of water bodies without losing the particularities of each individual metric. Historically, multimetric indices use information on richness, taxon sensitivity, and taxonomic diversity. Recently, functional and phylogenetic diversity proved to capture different dimensions of biodiversity. Here we asked if these new metrics provide complementary information to classical metrics and should be included in multimetric indices. We used an index construction protocol based on statistical filters to test candidate metrics for range, sensitivity, and redundancy. We used macroinvertebrate data from streams located in a Savanna region of Brazil, encompassing a gradient of impact, to test our ideas. Of 41 candidate metrics, functional dispersion of functional diversity, mean nearest neighbor distance of phylogenetic diversity, and four classical metrics passed the filter selection composing the final multimetric index. Our results indicated that functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics indeed responded to environmental impact and complemented the information provided by classical metrics. We suggest that future indices should consider including new metrics of functional and phylogenetic diversity to properly monitor multiple dimensions of biodiversity.

AB The study of biological traits have enhanced the understanding of the changes in the macroinvertebrate communities of the Rhone River during the last thirty years, as well as the potential effects of hydroclimatic factors and thermal discharges on the structure and the functioning of these communities at the regional scale. If every section of the Rhone had specific features, we observed over time a trend towards a higher uniformisation of invertebrate communities, especially in the Lower section. The strong impacts of the alien species and the water warming subsequent to the 2003 heat wave have been detected in the Lower Rhone and the Middle Rhone: the communities of the Middle Rhone gradually exhibit profiles closer to those of the communities of the Lower Rhone. The Upper Rhone was less colonized by alien species but was impaired by the global warming: its communities exhibited biological profiles closer to those of communities of further-downstream zones. In this site, the thermal discharges have led to a lower diversity of the communities and a higher occurrence of eurythermic species. Hence the benthic macrofauna of the Rhone River seems to have reacted quickly and strongly to environmental changes and to the arrival of invasive species. However numerous trait adaptations being common to Mediterranean and alien species, it seems complex to evaluate the respective weight of each of these potential sources of impairment. Predicting trends in invertebrate community composition is a complex objective because of the competition between native and/or invasive species in addition to man-induced environmental variation (flow, temperature). However, if biological invasion does not occur continuously but only based on specific events (especially hydroclimatology), we can legitimately believe that this drift will continue with the arrival of new Ponto-Caspian species via the Danube-Main Canal, their usual way to western and southern Europe. The common feature of these different species is that they are essentially predators or filterers, thermophilic and euryecic, and efficient functional competitors. Finally, this study once again emphasizes the importance of long-term monitoring in the study of biological communities in the context of global warming.

AB Limnoperna fortunei first came to scientific attention when it was introduced into the potable freshwater supply system of Hong Kong around 1968. The initial occurrence in Hong Kong was related to the commencement of supplies of water from the East River in China. Aspects of the biology and anatomy of L. fortunei were investigated in 1973 (Morton, Malacologia 12: 265-281, 1973). Then, comparisons were made with other mytiloids and with the invasive Dreissena polymorpha (Dreissenidae), which L. fortunei resembles superficially. The suggestion of a relationship between the two taxa was discounted on anatomical grounds-both species being convergently heteromyarian, adapting them to similar lives in the freshwater habitats of Eastern and, subsequently, Western Europe and North America, and mainland Asia plus Japan and Taiwan and latterly South America, respectively. The present study re-examines aspects of the biology and anatomy of L. fortunei commensurate upon its recent range extensions, specifically with regard to its occupation of a variety of freshwater habitats in order to better understand the reasons for its opportunistic success. It is concluded that L. fortunei probably evolved from a brackish water either Xenostrobus-like or Perna-like ancestor-the question of Limnoperna's ancestry still unresolved. Regardless, it was the evolution of the heteromyarian form in the, indisputedly mytiloidean, ancestor that opened up the hitherto bivalve-unoccupied hard-surface epibenthic environment for colonisation in both lentic and lotic freshwaters ecosystems. This was probably associated with the adoption of osmoregulation and efficient systems for the collection, selection and digestion of ample seston resources. The energy thereby obtained has been focussed into rapid fecundity at the expense of shell growth and the adoption, thereby, of a r-selected sexual strategy and life history trait.

ID CEPHALOPOD DYNAMIC CAMOUFLAGE; OCTOPODIDAE; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR
AB Cephalopods are often celebrated as masters of camouflage, but their exploitation of the soft-sediment habitats that dominate the ocean floor has demanded other anti-predator strategies. Previous research has identified a small number of cephalopods capable of burying into sand and mud, but the need to directly access the water column for respiration has restricted them to superficial burying. Here, we report on the first known sub-surface burrowing in the cephalopods, by Octopus kaurna, a small benthic species that uses advanced sand-fluidisation and adhesive mucus for sediment manipulation. This burrowing strategy appears linked to easily fluidised sediments as shown in experimental trials in three size-grades of sediment. While the selective pressures that drove evolution of this behaviour are unknown, its identification enriches our understanding of the possible life-history traits and functional role of mucus in other benthic octopus species living in soft-sediment environments.

AB Simple morphological traits of phytoplankton have proven to correlate well with the functional properties of taxa. A logical way of distinguishing functional groups of phytoplankton is to cluster species according to their morphological traits, instead of phytosociological traits, which are difficult to measure and incomplete for the vast majority of phytoplankton species. This novel approach inspired the establishment of morphologically based functional groups (MBFG) for lake phytoplankton. This study considers the MBFG as a potentially suitable tool for investigating and comparing the potamoplankton assemblages in riverine ecosystems. This study constructed a special version of MBFG that is aimed at rivers, termed MBFGR. MBFGR is based on information obtained from more than 800 samples of potamoplankton and zooplankton collected from 101 rivers located in four climate zones. Their habitat templates were also described by the thresholds of the environmental variables that promote group dominance. Despite its similar framework with MBFG, MBFGR emphasized the presence of flagella, size and shape, exoskeletal structures, life strategy and subdivision of diatoms. Their habitat templates are outlined by additional factors connected to hydrology and river types. Moreover, each discussed template includes consideration of grazing by zooplankton. Theoretically, MBFGR is better than MBFG because it can sensitively capture the ecological preferences of phytoplankton groups most associated with rivers and provides empirical values to reflect the environmental conditions in riverine ecosystems.

AB We present a new approach to the diversity of macrophyte communities based on species richness (S), Simpson's diversity index (SD), Rao's functional diversity (FD), functional attribute diversity (FAD) and the share of life history traits along a gradient of acidity in softwater lakes. On the basis of 10,800 cover-plant samples (squares with an area of 0.1 m(2)) collected from 241 sections of the bottom (depth belts) of 38 lakes, four communities were identified using the TWINSPAN algorithm: moss carpet (median water pH 4.7), isoetids with acidophytic mosses (pH 5.5), isoetids with neutrophytic mosses (pH 63) and neutrophytic vascular plants with charophytes (pH 7.1). Along a gradient of increasing pH, the diversity of communities increases and the species composition and share of life history traits are subject to significant changes. Evergreen, plagiotropic and unanchored plants with small, thin leaves (mosses) are replaced by evergreen, rosette forms (isoetids), which are replaced by non-evergreen charophytes and broadleaf vascular plants, especially pondweeds, in addition to an increasing fraction of plants with generative reproduction. A strong relationship was found between plant traits (leaves and shoots) and environmental factors (pH and calcium content). The regulator of diversity in macrophyte communities is the calcium concentration in water. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Seed traits are determined in 50 species from an evergreen forest in Sierra del Rosario, Cuba. These traits were analyzed at their community level, according to life form and season dispersal/collection. For this, we also included 40 trees species previously studied on the place. The variables studied were: number of seeds per fruit, seed mass (fresh/dry), coat dry mass, percentage of biomass allocation to the physical defenses (testa/endocarp) and water content. We found that trees exhibited the widest range in the number of seeds per fruit, seed mass and water content. It was also confirmed that life form significantly affected the variables of seminal mass, while there were no significant differences in the variables assessed when species were grouped according to their season dispersal. Nevertheless, seeds with larger total mass, coat dry mass and less hydration were collected during the dry season. At community level, in trees, shrubs and in rain (early/later) a negative correlation between seeds per fruit and the variables of mass was found. In the beginning of the rainy season, humidity content was positively correlated with total mass, and negatively correlated with the number of seeds and the percentage of coat, across all the 90 species and in trees. These results corroborate the presence of high variability in seed traits in the functional groups studied, and also in the correlations established among them. Nevertheless, in general, the seeds presenting bigger size and higher humidity were less numerous and showed thin coats.

AB We tested the contribution of the phylogenetic and specific components to the ecomorphological structure of stream fish from the upper Paraguai River and upper Sao Francisco River basins, and identified nodes in the phylogenetic tree at which major ecological shifts occurred. Fish were sampled between June and October of 2008 in 12 streams (six in each basin). In total, 22 species from the upper Paraguai River basin and 12 from the upper Sao Francisco River were analyzed. The ecomorphological patterns exhibited phylogenetic signal, indicating that the ecomorphological similarity among species is associated with the degree of relatedness. A strong habitat template is most likely to be the primary cause for a high phylogenetic signal. A significant contribution from the specific component was also detected, supporting the idea that the phylogenetic signal occurs in some clades for some traits, but not in others. The major ecological shifts were observed in the basal nodes, suggesting that ecological niche differences appear to accumulate early in the evolutionary history of major clades. This finding reinforces the role of key traits in the diversification of Neotropical fishes. Ecological shifts in recent groups could be related to morphological modifications associated with habitat use.

AB Morphological traits, such as size and shape, may reflect a combination of ecological and evolutionary responses by organisms. Ants have been used to evaluate the relationship between the environment and species coexistence and morphology. In the present study, we analyzed the morphology of workers of Gnamptogenys striatula Mayr in different landscapes from the Atlantic Domain in southeastern Brazil, focusing on the variation in the morphological attributes of these populations compared to those from a dense ombrophilous forest. Eighteen morphological traits of functional importance for interactions between workers and the environment were measured to characterize the size and shape of the workers. In general, the results show that ants of urban areas possess some morphological attributes of smaller size, with highly overlapped morphological space between the populations in forested ecosystems. Further, some of the traits related to predation were relatively smaller in modified land areas than in the populations from preserved areas of dense ombrophilous forest. These results help broaden the knowledge regarding morphological diversity in G. striatula, suggesting that the characterization of the morphology may be important to quantify the effects of land use on morphological diversity, and presumably, to facilitate the use of ants as biological indicators.

AB Despite the strong effects of disturbance on plant community diversity and assembly, we do not fully understand how different aspects of taxonomic or functional diversity respond to disturbance or how different assembly processes change along a disturbance gradient. In this study, plant communities were sampled and the distributions of three functional traits were measured in 45 plots across a flood disturbance gradient in Poyang Lake wetland in China. We examined the within-community means, ranges, variances, kurtoses, and other parameters of trait values. Results showed that the effects of disturbance depended largely on the aspects of diversity considered. Along the flood disturbance gradient, taxonomic/functional richness did not change, while Shannon-Wiener diversity and evenness and functional evenness and dispersion showed significant unimodal patterns. Communities experiencing the highest disturbance levels tended to have significantly shorter shoot heights with lower specific leaf area (SLA). We also found a significant non-random functional trait distribution: a significant reduction in the range and variance of SLA and a more even distribution of the measured traits compared with the null model. Our results highlight that niche-based assembly processes play structuring roles in wetland plant community response to flood disturbance gradients and that both environmental filtering and limiting similarity can work on the same traits (e.g., SLA) through hierarchical effects on the distribution of functional traits within communities.

AB 1. Many questions in ecology and evolutionary biology consider response variables that are functions (e.g. species-abundance distributions) rather than a single scalar value (e.g. species richness). Although methods for analysing function-valued data have been available for several decades, ecological and evolutionary applications are rare. We outline methods for regression when the response variable is a function (function regression') and introduce the r package FREE, which focuses on straightforward implementation and interpretation of function regression analyses. Several computational methods are implemented, including machine learning and several Bayesian methods. We compare different methods using simulated data and real ecological data on individual-size distributions (ISDs) of fish and trees. No single method performed best overall, with several performing equally well for a given data set. Which method to use depends on sample sizes and the questions being considered; in many cases, a consensus approach should be used to combine or compare fitted models. Function regression allows the direct modelling of many function-valued data (e.g. species-abundance distributions) rather than having to reduce those functions to a single scalar response variable (e.g. species diversity or functional diversity indices). Our ecological examples using ISD data show that larger rivers support more-even fish-size distributions than smaller rivers and that low initial planting densities lead to more-even tree-size distributions than high initial planting densities. Function regression provided more informative and intuitive interpretations of these data than conventional non-function-valued approaches.

AB Taxonomic and trait composition of invertebrate communities were investigated for 4 reference and 5 disturbed Mediterranean stream sites over a 18 y period, to test the hypotheses that: 1) human disturbance reduces the resilience of communities to extreme climatic events by affecting their functional structure; 2) and as a result, extreme climatic events could lead to asynchronous responses of communities from streams with similar environmental characteristics but differently affected by human disturbance. In reference sites, trait compositions changed differently (were less similar over time) in response to extreme events and variation was less synchronic than taxonomic compositions in the same sites. Oppositely, in disturbed sites there was a marked synchrony in trait composition indicating a functional homogenization in response to human pressures. This limitation in "functional diversity" may involve a lower ability to respond to climatic extreme events and also a reduced potential in ecosystem services. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In intertidal marine sediments, characterized by rapidly fluctuating and often extreme light conditions, primary production is frequently dominated by diatoms. We performed a comparative analysis of photophysiological traits in 15 marine benthic diatom species belonging to the four major morphological growth forms (epipelon (EPL), motile epipsammon (EPM-M) and non-motile epipsammon (EPM-NM) and tychoplankton (TYCHO)) found in these sediments. Our analyses revealed a clear relationship between growth form and photoprotective capacity, and identified fast regulatory physiological photoprotective traits (that is, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and the xanthophyll cycle (XC)) as key traits defining the functional light response of these diatoms. EPM-NM and motile EPL showed the highest and lowest NPQ, respectively, with EPM-M showing intermediate values. Like EPL, TYCHO had low NPQ, irrespective of whether they were grown in benthic or planktonic conditions, reflecting an adaptation to a low light environment. Our results thus provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of a trade-off between behavioural (motility) and physiological photoprotective mechanisms (NPQ and the XC) in the four major intertidal benthic diatoms growth forms using unialgal cultures. Remarkably, although motility is restricted to the raphid pennate diatom clade, raphid pennate species, which have adopted a non-motile epipsammic or a tychoplanktonic life style, display the physiological photoprotective response typical of these growth forms. This observation underscores the importance of growth form and not phylogenetic relatedness as the prime determinant shaping the physiological photoprotective capacity of benthic diatoms.

AB The suction traps of carnivorous Utricularia species are hollow bladders of foliar origin which trap and digest small organisms. In this paper, the trap wall anatomy and thickness in nine Australian Utricularia species belonging to three generic sections (Pleiochasia, Polypompholyx, Tridentaria) within the subgen. Polypompholyx are described. It is hypothesized that there is a close relationship between Utricularia trap wall anatomy and functional trap characteristics - species with more than two cell layers in their trap walls are less effective at trap firing (i.e., water aspiration) and resetting (water pumping) than species with two-layered trap walls. The trap walls of all Utricularia species studied using light microscopy consisted of two to five cell layers. A distinct variation in the trap wall structure occurred not only within one generic Utridularia section, but even within one species and also different parts of one trap. Using an electronic position sensor to monitor trap thickness showed that in two clones of Utricularia dichotoma, both firing (41 +/- 2 and 46 +/- 3 mu m mm(-1)) and resetting rates per unit trap length (14 +/- 1 mu m mm(-1) per 30 min) were markedly lower than the mean values for 13 aquatic Utricularia species obtained from the literature (73 +/- 2 and 52 +/- 21 mu m mm(-1), respectively). In conclusion, the number of cell layers in the trap wall may not in itself be decisive for the trap firing-resetting efficiency. The lag-period of water pumping by the trap, which can be caused by a different regulation mechanism of water pumping, is probably confined to the species from the Pleiochasia section in contrast to the aquatic species from the Utricularia section.

AB Numerous wetland restoration projects have been implemented in recent years to mitigate the increasing loss of global wetland surface area caused by human activities. Most of these projects have focused on the local recovery of habitats and species diversity, with little evaluation of functional recovery. We aimed at demonstrating that constructing wetlands on a degraded floodplain increases not only the taxonomic, but also the functional diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages by providing greater water quality to the local fauna. We studied the macroinvertebrate community using taxonomic and functional diversity indices, and the physicochemical characteristics of three wetlands constructed 5-25 years ago, and three relict natural wetlands on the floodplain of a regulated river (Ebro River, NE Spain). Constructed wetlands demonstrated significantly greater taxonomic abundance and richness of macroinvertebrates than natural wetlands. At the functional level, the richness and Shannon diversity of biological traits relating to reproduction, respiration, dispersal and feeding were also greater in constructed wetlands, which is partly explained by low inorganic nitrogen concentration in these habitats. In contrast, a high content of phosphorus and water organic matter led to the lowest values of taxonomic and functional diversity found in natural wetlands. We conclude that it is essential to consider not only taxonomic but also functional aspects at all stages of a restoration project in order to optimize its long-term efficacy to provide and support key species and functions.

AB We assessed long-term aquatic biodiversity patterns, with a focus on functional diversity (FD), by using sedimentary Chironomidae and Cladocera assemblages in four mountain lakes in the Austrian Alps. The objectives were to detect whether the invertebrate communities exhibited similar recent diversity trends in climate-sensitive alpine lakes, to observe how lake-specific limnological shifts affect biodiversity, and to test the relationship between taxonomic diversity (TD) and FD for paleolimnological biodiversity evaluations. We applied traditional TD indices to the sedimentary assemblages and used an FD index that was based on functional traits of the encountered taxa of both invertebrate groups. There were some similar long-term trends in invertebrate FD and TD among the lakes; e.g. chironomid diversity increased in two lakes and cladoceran diversity in three lakes toward the twentieth and twenty-first century, but in general the diversity patterns were variable between lakes. Overall, FD had a positive relationship with TD suggesting that functionality can be used in paleolimnological studies as a measure of biodiversity. However, cladoceran taxon richness did not correlate with FD in two lakes suggesting that TD is not always a surrogate for FD. Furthermore, TD of chironomids tended to increase more pronouncedly than FD in the top core sections indicating that increasing TD does not necessarily enhance FD and that different taxonomic entities may play similar functional roles in ecosystems. Accordingly, when evaluating biodiversity and ecological redundancy, functionality of the species pool should be carefully considered and highlighted also in paleolimnological research.

AB The progenitor of maize is Balsas teosinte (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis) which grows as a wild plant in the valley of the Balsas river in Mexico. Domestication, primarily targeting above-ground traits, has led to substantial changes in the plant's morphology and modern maize cultivars poorly resemble their wild ancestor. We examined the hypotheses that Balsas teosinte (accession PI 384071) has a) a different root system architecture and b) a structurally and functionally different rhizosphere microbial community than domesticated cultivars sweet corn (Zea mays subsp. mays accession PI 494083) and popping corn (Zea mays subsp. mays accession PI 542713). In a greenhouse experiment, five plants from each corn variety were grown in individual pots containing a Maury silt loam - perlite (2:1) mixture and grown to the V8 growth stage at which rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community structure was assessed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and fatty acid methyl ester analysis. Functional characteristics of the rhizosphere were assayed by examining the potential activity of seven extracellular enzymes involved in carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. Root system architecture was characterized by root scans of sand grown plants at the V5 growth stage. Compared to the control the sweet corn rhizosphere had different bacterial and fungal community structure, decreased fungal diversity and increased bacterial abundance. Teosinte caused a significant change in the rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community structure and increased bacterial abundance, but no significant decrease in bacterial or fungal diversity where the former was found to be significantly greater than in the sweet corn rhizosphere. Popping corn did not trigger significant changes in the bacterial or fungal diversity and bacterial abundance in the soil. The individual popping corn plants changed the bacterial and fungal communities in different directions and the overall effect on community structure was significant, but small. Of the enzymes analyzed, potential N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) activity was found to contributed most to the differentiation of teosinte rhizosphere samples from the other corn varieties. The teosinte root system had proportionally more very fine (diameter < 0.03 mm) roots than popping corn and sweet corn and it developed the highest root to shoot dry weight ratio, followed by popping corn. Sweet corn had significantly lower average root diameter than popping corn and teosinte and grew proportionally the least below-ground dry mass. The results allude to functional and structural differences in the rhizosphere microbial communities of the corn varieties that, with additional research, could lead to useful discoveries on how corn domestication has altered rhizosphere processes and how plant genotype influences nutrient cycling.

AB The prospect of increasing drought intensity in many river basins under climate change threatens the persistence of vulnerable freshwater species. Understanding how the traits of each species affect its resistance and resilience to drought may help to identify those species at most risk and elucidate the mechanisms by which impacts occur. I analysed macroinvertebrate monitoring data collected from rivers across Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (>10(6)km(2)) during the middle and later stages of the recent decade-long Millennium Drought and the initial post-drought period. I tested the ability of eight traits, expressing aspects of life history, diet and environmental tolerance, to explain changes in the broad-scale prevalence (the proportion of sites with observed presence) of macroinvertebrate families during and after the drought. The rate of basin-scale change in the riverine macroinvertebrate assemblage was least in the final stages of the drought. Immediately after the drought, the assemblage did not shift back towards its mid-drought state but instead moved further away. Eleven families that had a statistically significant fall in prevalence during the drought did not increase afterwards. Negative responses to drought were associated with slower maturation, absence of atmospheric respiration, high rheophily and low thermophily. Positive responses to cessation of drought were associated with having a holometabolous life cycle, greater requirements for dissolved oxygen, high rheophily and low thermophily. Because several traits were related to drought vulnerability, management to mitigate the adverse ecological effects of future droughts should consider a number of mechanisms by which drought has an effect. These include a loss of flowing water that supports rheophilous species, inadequate duration of wetting for species with a long aquatic phase, and effects of high temperature and hypoxia on species requiring cool conditions and well-aerated water. A revival of research on the life histories of freshwater invertebrate species and more information on oxygen requirements and temperature and desiccation tolerance are needed to improve our ability to predict the effects of drought.

   Aquatic biodiversity; Ecosystem services
AB Rivers are aquatic systems with a unidirectional flow. These systems are highly diverse habitats that support a great variety of organisms, which vary in shape and function, and sustain a diverse range of hydrological ecosystem services (HESs). The HESs provided by rivers varies based on complex hydro-geomorphological dynamics and their relationship with the functional processes of the basin. Land use changes in transition zones, where ecosystem functions are compromised, affect the basin, especially basins close to or on the periphery of urban areas. Such is the case for Mexico City, where 60 m(3) of water is consumed per second, 30% of which is imported from outside sources.
   The rivers of the Magdalena-Eslava sub-basin are among the few remaining surficial water sources in Mexico City. These rivers are located in an area classified as a Soil Conservation Zone, which has been intensely managed for decades. The aims of this paper are (1) to perform a hydrological evaluation of two urban streams and identify their relationship with the provision of hydrological ecosystem services via (i) a hydraulic balance analysis, (ii) a hydro-geomorphological characterization of each stream, (iii) an estimate of present and potential hydraulic erosion, (iv) the determination of physicochemical and bacteriological parameters and (v) a description of macroinvertebrates, macroalgae and their habitats in order to (2) identify the impacts of socio-economic dynamics on the responses of this rural-urban lotic system. Our results show that water flow, forest cover and hydro-geomorphologic heterogeneity are key to sustaining ecosystem functioning, especially in the high and middle sections of the basin. The highest potential provision of water for direct use was recorded in the sub-basin's middle section; however, the stream channels in that section have lost their natural water flow due to a water management infrastructure built to regulate flow during the rainy season. This intervention can be viewed as a regulation of HESs as water management infrastructure alters the transport of sediment and reduces available natural habitat. The provision of quality water in the lower area of the sub-basin has been seriously compromised by the establishment of illegal urban settlements. A relationship between biologically diverse ecological traits and their response capabilities was established and can be considered an indicator of current HES potential. Therefore, this sub-basin may constitute an example of good management and maximizing potential HESs in an urban-rural setting based on improved management strategies that could be applied in other developing nations.

AB QuestionsWe investigated some commonly held assumptions of community assembly theory needed to provide accurate predictions of changes in plant species assemblages across environmental gradients or following environmental change. Do (1) dominant and subordinate species respond in the same way to changes in environmental variables; (2) plant species assemblages show higher interspecific than intraspecific trait responses; and (3) co-existing dominant species differ in their responses to the same environmental variables?
   LocationIslands in Lakes Uddjaure and Hornavan, northern Sweden.
   MethodsWe explored the responses of forest understorey vegetation assemblages to variation in environmental resources across a chronosequence of 30 lake islands that differ in fire history, above-ground and below-ground resource availability and species diversity. For one plot on each island, we measured specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and foliar N and P of all dominant and subordinate understorey plant species to assess species-specific and weighted and non-weighted community-level trait responses to variation across islands in all major local environmental drivers.
   ResultsConsistent with our expectations, we found that species responses to environmental conditions were not homogenous within assemblages, and that responses of dominant and subordinate species differed. Further, intraspecific variation was often an important component of local-scale plant community-level responses. Responses were often relatively consistent across species, but dominant species sometimes showed contrasting responses of the same trait to the same environmental factor. Finally, environmental factors that influenced community average trait values also affected functional diversity.
   ConclusionsThis study has shown that several common assumptions that underpin community assembly theory do not necessarily hold, and this can cause inaccuracies in predicting plant functional composition responses to changes in environmental variables. Because these assumptions are central to current models that predict vegetation responses to environmental change, it is crucial to further test in which particular environmental context and to what extent these assumptions are critical for model accuracy.

AB Feeding behavior of macroinvertebrates is significant in determining aquatic ecosystem functioning. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the distribution of feeding guilds, and in particular on the influence of climate on the feeding functions at large spatial and long temporal scales. In this study, lakes at different climatic zones are examined for modern abundances of midge (Diptera) feeding guilds to establish the relationships between the feeding functions and climate. In addition, 11,000-year and 700-year sediment core records are investigated for their midge feeding guilds to establish their long-term relationships with climate changes. The results indicated that feeding guilds had a significant relationship with air temperature in the modern dataset and similar climate-related patterns in trait abundances had also occurred during the important climatic intervals of the past. In addition, the long-term records agreed with the modern spatial dataset in that feeding guild diversity was decreased under warm and cold climate compared to intermediate climate conditions. The results of this study are significant in demonstrating the influence of climate on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and in providing valuable information on long-term variability in feeding functions that is needed to better understand future changes under the ongoing climate change.

AB Recent studies considering the contribution of biodiversity to ecosystem functioning have emphasised the functional importance of individual species and, in so doing, have rekindled the use of categorical descriptors that group species according to their relative contribution to ecosystem processes or functioning. Such functional effect groupings, however, tend to be based on specific traits or contributory roles that are assumed to adequately characterise the functional importance of a species, rather than being based on direct measures of ecosystem processes and functions. This decoupling of organism-environment interaction is difficult to reconcile and, when applied widely, distorts understanding of the mediating role that species play in natural ecosystems. In this study, we begin to address this problem by characterising the functional contributions of 7 benthic invertebrate species for 2 ecosystem processes (particle reworking and bioirrigation) linked to 4 ecosystem functions (changing concentrations of NH4-N, NOx-N, PO4-P and SiO2-Si) and use these data to derive functional effect groupings. We show that whilst it is possible to categorise species according to how they influence ecosystem properties, the membership and number of functional effect groups depends on which ecosystem property is considered. Furthermore, we demonstrate that categorisations based on functional effects are not synonymous with species taxonomy and that they cannot be applied generically even when considering closely linked biogeochemical processes. Collectively, our findings call for a rethink of how functional effect groups are defined and emphasise the need to interrogate presumed links between species and ecosystem properties across a range of biodiversity-environment contexts.

AB Background: Sediment deposition constitutes a major disturbance having negative effects on aquatic ecosystems. The Chaiten Volcano eruption occurred on May 2008. As a consequence, broad areas along the Argentine Andes (40 degrees S to 46 degrees S) were covered with ash. This event provided an excellent opportunity to investigate how a natural and exceptional sedimentation episode affects Trichoptera communities.
   Results: We assessed changes in caddisfly community attributes (composition, density and diversity) and 11 biological traits, by comparing pre-eruption (May 2007 to April 2008) and post-eruption (July 2008 to March 2010) data at two headwater streams. As a consequence of the event, total suspended solids increased and Trichoptera richness and density significantly diminished. By March 2010, two common species of Hydroptilidae (Metrichia patagonica and Metrichia neotropicalis) were no longer recorded at one site; while species richness and density values were still low indicating that the community had not recovered. Scrapers, shredders, and predators were among the most affected functional feeding groups and changes in their relative abundance were tracked in subsequent years after the ashfall event.
   Conclusions: In this study, species tolerance to sedimentation was related to certain traits such as poorly synchronized life history, filter-feeding habits, rounded body shape, tegument respiration mode, and poorly sclerotized life forms.

To determine if B. proboscidea can become established along the South African coast and subsequently expand its range, we assessed brood size, larval size at hatching, larval survivorship and developmental time and rate of this species under temperature regimes reflective of those found along the coast. We also investigated similar temperature dependent development in the well-established non-indigenous shell borer Polydora hoplura which can serve as a proxy for our predictions. Worms were cultured in glass capillary tubes at five different temperature treatments (12 degrees C, 17 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C) and planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae were tracked from oviposition to settlement. We found that in P. hoplura, females producing adelphophagic larvae had smaller broods at the highest temperature treatment and higher temperatures resulted in significantly larger sizes at hatching. Survivorship of planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae was highest at the intermediate to high temperature treatments (21 degrees C and 24 degrees C) and was generally lower at the lower temperatures (12 degrees C and 17 degrees C). Temperature had no significant effect on brood size of B. pro boscidea whereas higher temperatures resulted in larger hatching sizes for planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae. In B. proboscidea, larval types showed differences in survival optima with planktotrophic larvae exhibiting its highest survivorship at the colder temperatures and lowest at the warmer temperatures while adelphophagic larvae had its highest survivorship at 21 degrees C and its lowest at the extreme temperatures. There was a positive relationship between temperature and developmental rate for both species. The difference in larval sizes of the non-feeding planktotrophic larvae of B. proboscidea was attributed to a growth window that allowed for variability in reproductive traits based on exogenous factors such as temperature. More importantly, the results indicate that B. pro boscidea will be capable of producing viable populations at different localities along the South African coast including those where P. hoplura has already been established.

AB The mechanism underlying species abundance distribution (SAD), particularly the characteristics of "excess of rare species,'' remains controversial. The current equilibrium theory cannot explain the transient dynamics of SAD, which is essential for predicting biodiversity response to environmental changes. Using a unique 32-yr-long phytoplankton community data set from a pelagic site of Lake Biwa, Japan, we show that the dynamics of functional groups driven by environmental variation explain the excess of rare species over time. First, most of the rare species belong to the littoral group supplied through dispersal, whereas the common species belong to the pelagic group. Second, the littoral group was negatively influenced by environmental changes (i.e., lake warming, water-level manipulation, and partial re-oligotrophication), mechanistically explaining truncation of the excess of rare species in the SAD associated with biodiversity loss in Lake Biwa. Our findings imply the significance of an ecological trait-based approach for SAD theory and managing biodiversity in a changing environment.

AB This study was conducted in Lake Varano (southern Italy) in order to determine the environmental parameters that influence nematode taxonomic and functional diversity and how they influence them, and to classify for the first time the ecological quality status of a transitional environment. The general composition and level of taxonomic diversity were comparable with those reported for transitional environments worldwide. Principal component analysis revealed that the main environmental factors controlling the assemblages in terms of both composition and biological traits were grain size, organic matter, pollution load index and, only secondarily, salinity. Molgolaimus allgeni, Terschellingia longicaudata and Leptolaimus luridus showed higher values in relation to silt, organic matter and pollution load index, while Axonolaimus caudostriatus, Odontophora wieseri, Paramonhystera pellucida and Paracanthonchus longicaudatus showed higher values in relation to the redox potential and sand percentage. Salinity was detected as an influencing parameter only secondarily and particularly for Calomicrolaimus honestus, Daptonema normandicum, Thalassomonhystera parva and Sabatieria pulchra. With respect to functional traits, the trophic groups seemed to be mainly related to sediment type, which is in turn reflected by the nature of the available food. The maturity index, as well as c-p classes, did not always permit a clear interpretation of the interaction between anthropogenic and natural factors. However, the greater influence of the San Antonino and San Francesco Canals was perfectly revealed by the nematode assemblage. In accordance with the current ecological quality classes, Lake Varano can mainly be classified as having good to poor ecological quality status.

AB Background and Aims The balance between stochastic forces and frequency-dependent mating largely governs style morph frequencies in heterostylous populations. In clonal species, deviations from equal morph ratios often result from founder events and unfavourable conditions for sexual reproduction. The aim of this study was to investigate whether different flooding regimes, because of their influence on sexual vs. clonal reproduction, are associated with regional variation in morph frequencies and floral trait differentiation in populations of the clonal, tristylous, aquatic Eichhornia azurea (Pontederiaceae) in the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil.
   Methods Style morph frequencies were sampled from 73 populations distributed across four flooding regimes differing in depth and duration. Measurements of flower size, sex-organ dimension, pollen size and pollen production were made in selected populations, and pollinator assemblages and their functional traits were recorded.
   Key Results Most populations of E. azurea were tristylous (78 %), but the majority exhibited uneven morph ratios. The frequency of the mid-styled morph was significantly lower than that of the long-and short-styled morphs. Morph evenness was positively associated with population size but not with flooding regime. There were significant phenotypic differences among flooding regimes for all floral traits, including populations with reduced flower size, sex-organ length and smaller pollen. Pollinator assemblages varied with flood duration.
   Conclusions The similar morph structure and evenness of populations, regardless of flooding regime, suggest that sexual reproduction and clonal dispersal are sufficiently common to prevent the signature of founder events from dominating in a region. However, the pervasive occurrence of biased morph ratios in most populations suggests that many are in a non-equilibrium state. The reduced frequency of the mid-styled morph in trimorphic and dimorphic populations may be associated with the weak self-incompatibility of this morph resulting in selfing and inbreeding depression. Clonality in E. azurea and the weak self-incompatibility of the mid-styled morph may make it more vulnerable to geitonogamous selfing.

AB The current investigation deals with isolation and functional characterization of agriculturally important novel alkali-halophilic actinomycetes from water and sediment samples of three distinct niches, namely, central, south and sea mouth sectors of the Chilika brackish water lake. A total of 59 different morphotypes based on phenotypic characterization were isolated from different sectors of the lake. Among them, a total of twenty one isolates were screened as alkali-halophiles based on screening for salt and pH tolerance on starch casein agar medium amended with 10 % NaCl and at pH 9.0. Further characterization for plant growth promotion and biocontrol attributes revealed that the south sector harboured a maximum percentage of siderophore producers while the central sector had the highest indole 3-acetic acid as well as extracellular protease producers. The sea mouth sector had a higher portion of actinomycetes possessing nitrate reductase activity and some biocontrol attributes such as antimicrobial activity against fungal pathogens (Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium udum and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri) and production of chitinase enzyme. Identification including 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that isolates belonged to the Streptomyces and Micromonospora genera, respectively.

AB Understanding how ecological processes determine patterns among species coexisting within ecosystems is central to ecology. Here, we explore relationships between species' local coexistence and their trophic niches in terms of their feeding relationships both as consumers and as resources. We build on recent concepts and methods from community phylogenetics to develop a framework for analysing mechanisms responsible for community composition using trophic similarity among species and null models of community assembly. We apply this framework to 50 food webs found in 50 Adirondack lakes and find that species composition in these communities appears to be driven by both bottom-up effects by which the presence of prey species selects for predators of those prey, and top-down effects by which prey more tolerant of predation out-compete less tolerant prey of the same predators. This approach to community food webs is broadly applicable and shows how species interaction networks can inform an increasingly large array of theory central to community ecology.

AB Sewage effluents are recognized as one of the most common sources of river degradation. However, very few investigators have tried to evaluate ecosystem recovery after cessation of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge. Our goals were to: 1) analyze invertebrate community responses to chemical water quality and habitat changes after wastewater treatment improvement, and 2) evaluate the abilities of taxonomy-based and trait-based approaches to detect and explain community recovery processes in a multistressor context. We studied the benthic macroinvertebrate community of 3 sites of a heavily impaired stream (the Vistre River, France) during a 4-y period that included the decommissioning of a deficient WWTP (WWTP-A) and the commissioning of a new one (WWTP-B). We assessed the recovery of the benthic community by comparing observed taxonomic and trait-based (i.e., functional) metrics at the study site to values estimated with information from least-impaired reaches of the same river type. Most taxonomy-based characteristics of benthic communities subjected to WWTP-A recovered in 3 mo, but the recovery time of several trait-based characteristics was similar to 2 y. No change was observed in taxonomic and trait-based diversity during the 4-y study. Taxonomy-based metrics detected the first signs of river reach recovery rapidly, but combinations of trait-based metrics and taxonomic abundance-based metrics are more likely to identify functional recovery of invertebrate assemblages faced with water-quality improvement, even when multiple stressors impaired upstream reaches.

AB Aquatic macrophytes suffer from widespread and profound habitat deterioration that has led to dramatic changes in species distributional patterns. We explored linkages between species functional traits and abundance patterns by analyzing mean community trait values in 1083 Danish lowland streams. We expected that widespread macrophytes would share common traits and that species with smaller ranges would be negatively associated with these traits. We selected 11 traits to characterize the ecological features of 52 amphibious and submerged species. We examined the relationships between species abundance and species traits with multivariate ordination and coinertia analysis (COIA), and identified groups of species with similar distributional patterns and ecological traits by hierarchical cluster analysis. Local abundance and geographical range size of submerged and amphibious species were significantly positively related. Species abundance and species traits tables were significantly correlated, and species were separated into 5 groups based on life form, productivity, meristem characteristics, ability to fragment, and the size of the root-rhizome system. Widespread plant species in Danish lowland streams shared common traits, such as meristem, dispersal, and productivity characteristics, and we infer that these traits are likely to have adaptive value in eutrophic and hydromorphologically disturbed habitats. On the other hand, species with narrower range sizes were characterized by a different set of trait characteristics. We conclude that species abundance and distribution patterns are closely correlated with ecological trait characteristics and that traits associated with resilience to anthropogenic disturbance confer success in Danish streams.

AB A consensus has been established that functional traits rather than taxonomic diversity playa fundamental role in linking biodiversity with ecosystem processes and associated services. This study from Finland addressed an issue of relative values of fallow and field margin biotopes in conservation of plant functional diversity (based on six functional traits of relevance to ecosystem services, and diversity of multiple traits) in agricultural landscapes differing in their structural complexity. Relative covers of plant species were surveyed in sampling plots located in perennial fallow fields and three types of perennial margins (margins between crop fields, along forest edges and by river) in three types of landscape context (simple, intermediate and complex). Fallow fields significantly contributed to the total functional diversity only in simple landscapes. The river margins provided the greatest functional diversity, especially in reproduction and regeneration traits while crop margins were consistently characterized by the lowest functional diversity. Substantial functional diversity of fallow patches in simple landscapes was due to high abundance of functional species, while that of river margins stemmed from presence of unique species. The plant functional diversity progressively declined with agricultural landscapes becoming simplified. The study indicates non-cropped biotopes having complementary roles in ensuring multifunctionality of agro-landscapes and confirms importance of biotope mosaic for functional diversity.

AB AimOur aim was to document geographical patterns of variation in the body-size structure of European lake fish assemblages along abiotic gradients, and any differences in fish assemblage structure. We hypothesized that patterns in the body-size structure of entire lake fish assemblages are primarily temperature driven and consistent with the dominant pattern of the temperature-size rule, which suggests a decrease in adult body size with increasing developmental temperature for many ectothermic species.
   Location356 European lakes.
   MethodsVariation in the body-size structure of fish assemblages was explored on a continental scale along gradients of temperature, morphometry, productivity and fish assemblage structure for 356 European lakes. The mean fish assemblage body-size and individual body-size distributions were selected as size metrics. Separate analyses were conducted for lakes located within five ecoregion subsets (Borealic Uplands/Tundra, FennoScandian Shield, Central Plains, Western Plains and Western Highlands) and for lakes with different functional fish classifications (cold-, cool- and warmwater fish assemblages).
   ResultsGeographical patterns of variation in the body-size structure of European lake fish assemblages could be clearly discerned along a temperature gradient for both the continental dataset (356 lakes) and the smaller geographical (ecoregion) subsets. We found systematic changes in fish assemblage body-size structure across temperature gradients in correspondence with the dominant thermal fish guild. The majority of the lakes, mainly located in the warmer European lowlands, were dominated by eurythermic cool- and warmwater fish assemblages, with smaller sized individuals characterized by linear individual body-size distributions. Lakes located in colder regions and dominated by stenothermic coldwater salmonids with larger sized individuals were characterized by unimodal or bimodal size distributions. The mean body size of cold-, cool- and warmwater fish assemblages changed uniformly along the temperature gradient.
   Main conclusionsPatterns of variation in the body-size structure of European lake fish assemblages are consistent with the temperature-size rule. Temperature modifies fish assemblage size structure uniformly within the thermal fish guilds and in different ecoregions. Furthermore, our results indicate an increasing predictive power of temperature to explain variability in body-size structure when moving from warmer to colder geographical regions.

AB <list list-type="1" id="fwb12437-list-0001"> Biological traits, which may give insights into the mechanisms driving the distribution of organisms along gradients of stressor intensities, have been proposed as a tool for disentangling the effects of multiple stressors acting simultaneously on scales ranging from climatic region to river basins, valleys, reaches and microhabitats. However, the combined effects of farming intensity and flow reduction on biological traits of stream invertebrates remain to be studied. We assessed the benthic invertebrate community and physicochemistry at 43 stream sites along gradients of farming intensity (0-95% of the catchment in intensively managed grassland) and water abstraction (0-92% streamflow reduction). Using general linear models and an information-theoretic approach, we studied individual and combined effects of agricultural stressors on invertebrate traits and community composition. Traits often followed predictable patterns along stressor gradients, and non-additive interactions between paired stressors were common. Farming intensity was more frequently related to life-history, resistance and resilience traits, whereas water abstraction was correlated more often with general biological traits such as feeding habits, dietary preference and respiration. Further, traits and traditional measures of community structure, such as taxon relative abundances and community indices, offered a similar level of distinction along the gradients of stressor intensities. Our findings indicate that invertebrate traits can differentiate the effects of multiple stressors and provide insights into potential mechanisms. At the landscape scale, farming intensity exerted stronger effects via invertebrate habitat quality and water abstraction via food availability. At the reach scale, both fine sediment and nutrients affected habitat quality, whereas nutrients showed more marked effects via food availability. Finally, we propose a suite of traits that may provide the strongest differentiation of stressor intensities. <doi origin="wiley" registered="yes">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2427</doi

AB <list list-type="1" id="fwb12443-list-0001"> Trait-based approaches provide a framework for integrating the distribution of functional traits associated with ecological strategies into the responses of plant community dynamics along environmental gradients. We used a trait-based approach to unravel the processes governing macrophyte community assembly along a water depth gradient. We sampled 42 plots and 1513 individual plants and measured 12 functional traits and abundance of 17 macrophyte species. The results showed significant evidences of habitat filtering (i.e. a significant reduction in the range and variance of trait values) and of niche differentiation (i.e. trait values distributed more evenly than expected), both of which affected the functional responses of macrophyte communities associated with different sets of traits in significant different patterns along the gradient. Habitat filtering effects increased significantly for specific leaf area and leaf carbon content along the gradient. Niche differentiation effects increased significantly for leaf dry mass content, but decreased for ramet size, shoot height and leaf carbon content with increasing water depth, implying that the relative strength of biotic competition in a specific functional niche would vary with water depth. Intraspecific trait variability promoted significantly the detection of habitat filtering effects on stem diameter, lamina thickness and stem dry mass content, and niche differentiation effects on specific leaf area, leaf dry mass content, shoot height, stem diameter, stem dry mass content and ramet size. Community assembly processes shape the functional trait distribution within communities along environmental gradients through hierarchical effects of habitat filtering and niche differentiation. Our study highlights that niche differentiation plays a structuring role in macrophyte community assembly and that intraspecific trait variability is an important factor influencing macrophyte community dynamics. <doi origin="wiley" registered="yes">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2427</doi

AB <list list-type="1" id="fec12272-list-0001"> Theory predicts that species performing similar roles for ecological processes or functions can compensate for the loss of others and that this functional redundancy may promote resilience. However, there is no clear evidence for this mechanism, because functional redundancy has been observed to be low in many ecosystems. Using a severe flood event, this study tests whether functional redundancy exists in floodplain ground beetle communities, how it is controlled and how it connects to post-flood resilience. Ground beetles were sampled in floodplain grassland of the Elbe River, Germany. Functional redundancy was estimated as the proportion of species in a community having neutral effects on functional diversity. Null models were used to determine whether functional redundancy is higher or lower than expected and mixed effects modelling was applied to estimate the relationships between functional redundancy, flood disturbance and sampling season. It was found that highly redundant ground beetle communities experienced fewer losses in functional diversity caused by an extreme flood than less redundant communities. Functional redundancy was lowest immediately after the flood, but quickly increased with time since flooding. It was significantly higher in spring than in autumn seasons and significantly higher in habitats exposed to frequent flooding. Null models confirmed that these patterns were to a high degree non-random. The results indicate that functional redundancy plays an important role for stabilizing ground beetles under regular, predictable flooding. However, given sizeable differences in functional diversity before and after the extreme flood, this effect may be lower than expected during extreme events. Other regulating forces, such as stochastic colonization processes and habitat templets, play more important roles directly after extreme disturbances. I therefore assume that a temporal hierarchy of mechanisms, including FR, controls the functional diversity of ground beetles in riparian habitats. <doi origin="wiley" registered="yes">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435</doi

   There has been growing recent interest in the relative importance of within-species trait variation vs. across-species trait variation in vascular plants in determining total community-level trait variation across communities and environmental gradients. Recent studies on plant communities have generally found across-species variation to be more important than within-species variation, but comparable studies involving other functionally important biota, such as lichens, are largely lacking.
   We used a fire-driven chronosequence involving 30 lake islands in northern Sweden to study how declining soil fertility during retrogression affects the functional traits of each of the dominant epiphytic lichen species growing on the trunks of the tree Betula pubescens. We measured several functional traits for the commonest lichen species on each island and used community-weighted measures to study the community-level responses of lichens to the gradient.
   We found that as retrogression proceeds and soil fertility declines, thallus N and P concentrations and specific thallus mass (STM) increase, both within species and at the community level. Lichen secondary compounds showed contrasting within-species responses and were non-responsive at the whole community level.
   By decomposing community-level measures of these traits across the gradient, we showed that for the three most responsive traits (N, P and STM), within-species variation was substantially more important than across-species variation. This emerges in part because lichen species composition was not very responsive to ecosystem retrogression, and because unlike vascular plants, lichens easily absorb elements over their entire surface, meaning that nutrient concentrations within lichen species are likely to more closely reflect nutrient availability.
   We found that within-species variability drove the changes in community-weighted measures of lichen traits across a strong environmental gradient, which contrasts strongly with what we know from studies of vascular plants where across-species variation and species turnover is much more important. To understand how lichen functional traits at the community level respond to environmental factors, it is therefore essential to consider the responses of individual species, and the application of traits-based approaches to lichen communities needs to account for their considerable intraspecific variability.

AB AimThis study aims (1) to quantify the broad-scale patterns of functional diversity and life-history strategies of freshwater fish in relation to environmental variation across Australian river basins and (2) to identify key life-history traits associated with species extinction risk in order to determine how fish communities and extinction-prone species may respond to future environmental change.
   LocationOne hundred and twenty-three river basins across eastern Australia.
   MethodsBased on 10 key life-history traits for 194 freshwater fish we used a novel analytical approach to quantify multivariate life-history indices in relation to environmental variation within a spatio-phylogenetic framework. We assessed the utility of our analytical framework by contrasting final models against all candidate models, both with and without an eigenvector filtering procedure, and quantified the degree of autocorrelation in all model residuals.
   ResultsTemperature, habitat heterogeneity/availability, flow variability and primary productivity accounted for between 55 and 80% of the variation in life-history indices. Best-performing models were all derived from the addition of spatial and phylogenetic covariates to the analytical framework which consistently produced more parsimonious final models with higher explanatory power and insignificant levels of autocorrelation in the model residuals.
   Main conclusionThe life-history functional diversity of fish assemblages and the composition of life-history strategies across Australian river basins is in part determined by environmental variability, stability and seasonality, highlighting both the importance of environmentally driven community assembly processes and the potential changes to freshwater fish biodiversity in response to climate change. A spatio-phylogenetic analytical framework is a key component in the effective management of autocorrelation in ecological data and the derivation of more rigorous trait-environment relationships.

AB AimHuman activities and the consequent extirpations of native species and introductions of non-native species have been modifying the composition of species assemblages throughout the world. These anthropogenic impacts have modified the richness of assemblages as well as the biological dissimilarity among them. However, while changes in taxonomic dissimilarity (i.e. accounting for species composition) have been assessed intensively during the last decade there are still few assessments of changes in functional dissimilarity (i.e. accounting for the diversity of biological traits). Here, we assess the temporal changes in both taxonomic and functional dissimilarities for freshwater fish assemblages across Europe.
   LocationWestern Palaearctic, 137 river basins.
   MethodsThe Jaccard index was used to quantify the changes in both taxonomic and functional dissimilarity. We then partitioned dissimilarity to extract its turnover component and measured the changes in the contribution of turnover to dissimilarity.
   ResultsFunctional homogenization exceeded taxonomic homogenization six-fold. More importantly, we found only a moderate positive correlation between these changes. For instance, 40% of assemblages that experienced taxonomic differentiation were actually functionally homogenized. Taxonomic and functional homogenizations were stronger when the historical level of taxonomic dissimilarity among assemblages was high and when a high number of non-native species were introduced in the assemblages. Moreover, translocated species (i.e. non-native species originating from Europe) played a stronger role than exotic species (i.e. those coming from outside Europe) in this homogenization process, while extirpation did not play a significant role.
   Main conclusionsChange in taxonomic diversity cannot be used to predict changes in functional diversity. In addition, as functional diversity has been proven to be a better indicator of ecosystem functioning and stability than taxonomic diversity, further studies are required to test the potential effects of functional homogenization at the local scale.

AB The relative contributions of environmental and spatial processes in macroinvertebrate community structure (i.e., beta-diversity) for three functional groups classified on the basis of dispersal ability and microhabitat selection (seagrass-associated [SA], drift-faunal [DF], and benthic-faunal [BF] groups) were examined in a seagrass ecosystem along the Sanriku coast of Japan. Variation partitioning was conducted to explain the environmental heterogeneity and spatial arrangement of local communities (i.e., degree of variation in the community) for each functional group. Processes determining community structure and metacommunity type differed among the functional groups. The SA group was under greater influence of environmental control, whereas the fractions of beta-diversity in the DF and BF groups were explained by only spatial predictors. Thus, even if macroinvertebrate communities live in the same ecosystem, different mechanisms may determine the functional community structure, which depends on ecological traits such as dispersal ability and microhabitat. Ecological processes underlying community assembly differ among functional groups, indicating that the existence and/or dynamics of seagrass patches may affect the variation of faunal functions in an ecosystem.

AB The phytoplankton structure and dynamics were analysed in relation to abiotic variables in Paso de las Piedras Reservoir, Argentina. Phytoplankton driving forces were explored using a functional approach. A total of 15 functional groups were identified among which D, P, H1, F, J and C were the most important. A Canonical variate analysis indicated that the categorization of the species in functional groups and its relationship with the temporal species clustering was not a random result. In the redundancy analysis, temporal ordination dynamics of functional groups was well described by the distribution of samples. Remarkable shifts in composition and biomass of phytoplankton occurred in agreement with changes in temperature, N:P ratio and transparency. The group succession could be summarized as: P/J (early summer)-> P/H1 (late summer)-> P (early autumn)-> P/F (late autumn)-> C (early winter)-> D (late winter)-> Y (early spring)-> D (early spring)-> P (late spring). The majority of the associations detected were typical of eutrophic-hypertrophic systems. With the exception of H1, the groups that most contribute to biovolume were those characteristics of mixed aquatic environments, i.e., non-stratifying lakes or deep, well-mixed epilimnia of stratifying lakes. The diversity indices, in terms of functional groups, were low, meaning that a small number of traits were present and/or that there was an inequitable distribution.

AB Bacterial communities are immensely diverse and drive many fundamental ecosystem processes. However, the role of bacterial community composition (BCC) for functioning is still unclear. Here we evaluate the relative importance of BCC (from 454-sequencing), functional traits (from Biolog Ecoplates) and environmental conditions for per cell biomass production (BPC; H-3-leucine incorporation) in six data sets of natural freshwater bacterial communities. BCC explained significant variation of BPC in all six data sets and most variation in four. BCC measures based on 16S rRNA (active bacteria) did not consistently explain more variation in BPC than measures based on the 16S rRNA-gene (total community), and adding phylogenetic information did not, in general, increase the explanatory power of BCC. In contrast to our hypothesis, the importance of BCC for BPC was not related to the anticipated dispersal rates in and out of communities. Functional traits, most notably the ability to use cyclic and aromatic compounds, as well as local environmental conditions, i.e. stoichiometric relationships of nutrients, explained some variation in all six data sets. In general there were weak associations between variation in BCC and variation in the functional traits contributing to productivity. This indicates that additional traits may be important for productivity as well. By comparing several data sets obtained in a similar way we conclude that no single measure of BCC was obviously better than another in explaining BPC. We identified some key functional traits for productivity, but although there was a coupling between BCC, functional traits and productivity, the strength of the coupling seems context dependent. However, the exact context is still unresolved.

AB Frogs are characterized by a morphology that has been suggested to be related to their unique jumping specialization. Yet, the functional demands associated with jumping and swimming may not be that different as suggested by studies with semi-aquatic frogs. Here, we explore whether features previously identified as indicative of good burst swimming performance also predict jumping performance in a highly aquatic frog, Xenopus tropicalis. Moreover, we test whether the morphological determinants of jumping performance are similar in the two sexes and whether jumping performance differs in the two sexes. Finally we test whether jumping capacity is positively associated with burst swimming and terrestrial endurance capacity in both sexes. Our results show sex-specific differences in jumping performance when correcting for differences in body size. Moreover, the features determining jumping performance are different in the two sexes. Finally, the relationships between different performance traits are sex-dependent as well with females, but not males, showing a trade-off between peak jumping force and the time jumped to exhaustion. This suggests that different selective pressures operate on the two sexes, with females being subjected to constraints on locomotion due to their greater body mass and investment in reproductive capacity. In contrast, males appear to invest more in locomotor capacity giving them higher performance for a given body size compared to females.

AB A striking example of climate-mediated range shifts in marine systems is the intrusion of tropical species into temperate areas world-wide, but we know very little about the ecological consequences of these range expansions. In the Mediterranean Sea, the range expansion of tropical rabbitfishes that first entered the basin via the Suez Canal provides a good example of how tropical herbivorous fish can impact the structure of rocky bottoms in temperate seas. Two species of rabbitfishes have now become a dominant component of total fish biomass in the southernmost part of the eastern Mediterranean. Experimental evidence shows these species can profoundly transform benthic communities, turning algal forests into barrens', but the specific mechanisms that facilitate this shift have not been established. We surveyed 1000km of coastline in the eastern Mediterranean and identified two clearly distinct areas, a warmer group of regions with abundant tropical rabbitfish and a colder group of regions where these consumers were absent/ extremely rare. In regions with abundant rabbitfish, canopy algae were 65% less abundant, and there was a 60% reduction of overall benthic biomass (algae and invertebrates) and a 40% decrease in total species richness. Video-recorded feeding experiments showed that the extensive barrens characteristic of regions with abundant rabbitfish were not due to greater rates of herbivory by these tropical consumers, but rather by functional differences among the herbivores. Temperate herbivorous fish displayed the greatest macroalgae consumption rates overall, but they fed exclusively on established adult macroalgae. In contrast, in regions with abundant rabbitfishes, these consumers fed complementarily on both established macroalgae and on the epilithic algal matrix, which typically contains macroalgal recruits.Synthesis. Range-shifting tropical rabbitfish can severely reduce the biomass and biodiversity of temperate reefs at a scale of hundreds of kilometres. A shift from macroalgal dominance to barrens is mediated by the addition of functionally diverse herbivores that characterize tropical reefs. This work highlights the importance of assessing the functional traits of range-shifting species to determine potential mechanisms of impact on ecological communities.

AB AimWe propose a trait-based approach for assessing and mapping potential niche overlap between native and exotic species at large spatial scales.
   LocationThe Mediterranean Sea.
   MethodsWe developed two complementary indices based on ecological, biological and ecomorphological similarities between native and exotic species. The first index (FNNr) allows identifying areas where native species are the most at risk in terms of potential ecological interactions with exotic species. The second index (FGO) is species-specific and allows identifying native species that display the broadest functional niche overlap and range overlap with exotic species. We illustrated our approach using the Mediterranean coastal fish fauna as a case study.
   ResultsWe found that endemic and exotic fishes had a similar global functional niche at the Mediterranean scale, that is, they filled the same functional space defined by trait axes. FNNr hotspots were found to be moderately congruent with exotic species richness hotspots. Higher values of FNNr were observed along the coasts of the Levantine Sea. The computation of the FGO index showed that the geographical range of a given endemic species overlapped in average with 52 exotic species. Species showing the highest FGO values displayed localized and/or fragmented distributions in the eastern Mediterranean basin.
   Main conclusionsOur findings suggest that the number of exotic species alone cannot be used as a broad-scale indicator of potential impact because this metric does not account for functional relatedness between native and exotic species. The trait-based indices developed in this study can be used for other taxa in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and should help environmental managers to set up local-scale studies on areas where the potential impact of exotic species on native biodiversity is the highest.

AB Information on both structure and functions is essential to evaluate the ecological integrity of stream ecosystems and their response to natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Leaf-bags have been widely employed to assess stream ecosystem processes and the degree of leaf mass consumption has been proposed as one of the most useful functional descriptor in aquatic environments. However, the breakdown rate of leaves has been compared with structural indicators of macroinvertebrate assemblages derived from leaf-bags or from benthic samples, without any direct comparison on the characteristics of communities sampled with the two methods. The main objective of the paper is to conduct a comparative analysis of the structure, functional organization and biological traits of macroinvertebrate assemblages from artificial leaf packs and from benthic samples of a third-order stream in the Central Apennines (Italy).
   Of the 43 macroinvertebrate taxa globally found in our survey, 9 showed low ability or scarce attitude to colonize leaf-bags, while 6 rare taxa were exclusively sampled in artificial leaf packs. Both assemblages were characterized by the dominance of Chironomidae, though they were more abundant in leaf-bags (71% of total individuals collected) than in benthic samples (44%). Conversely, the mayfly Baetis sp. comprised more than 17% of total individuals collected with Surber nets and only 5% of leaf-bag assemblages. We found that compared to benthic assemblages, leaf-bag communities were less diversified with a lower richness and a lower number of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Plecoptera (EPT) taxa; significant differences also emerged in assemblage composition.
   Contrary to what expected, artificial leaf packs resulted not particularly attractive for shredder organisms and were mainly colonized by collectors. Also the biological trait profiles of the leaf-bag community were significantly different from those shared by resident benthic taxa.
   Our findings could have profound implications in the assessment of the structural and functional integrity of stream ecosystems and in studies on freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In these studies, the two methods (leaf-bags and Surber nets) should be regarded as complementary and not alternative. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, community ecologists are focusing on the relative importance of local environmental factors and proxies to dispersal limitation to explain spatial variation in community structure. Albeit less explored, temporal processes may also be important in explaining species composition variation in metacommunities occupying dynamic systems. We aimed to evaluate the relative role of environmental, spatial and temporal variables on the metacommunity structure of different organism groups in the Upper Parana River floodplain (Brazil). We used data on macrophytes, fish, benthic macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, periphyton, and phytoplankton collected in up to 36 habitats during a total of eight sampling campaigns over two years. According to variation partitioning results, the importance of predictors varied among biological groups. Spatial predictors were particularly important for organisms with comparatively lower dispersal ability, such as aquatic macrophytes and fish. On the other hand, environmental predictors were particularly important for organisms with high dispersal ability, such as microalgae, indicating the importance of species sorting processes in shaping the community structure of these organisms. The importance of watercourse distances increased when spatial variables were the main predictors of metacommunity structure. The contribution of temporal predictors was low. Our results emphasize the strength of a trait-based analysis and of better defining spatial variables. More importantly, they supported the view that "all-or- nothing" interpretations on the mechanisms structuring metacommunities are rather the exception than the rule.

AB Important, often abrupt, and irreversible shifts associated with the degradation of ecosystem functioning and services are increasingly commonplace. Thus, a trait-based view of communities may be more insightful than that based solely on species composition, especially when inferring ecological responses to environmental change. This underscores the importance and urgency of establishing benchmarks against which future community changes and functional structure can be evaluated. As a first step toward setting these baselines and their current spatial variability, we here describe geographic and among-habitat patterns in the functional structure of shallow hard bottom communities, including fish assemblages, across the northeast and west coasts of Rapa Nui. We also document temporal patterns of change in dominant benthic functional groups that have taken place over the past 15 years at selected sites on this isolated Pacific island. Generally weak vertical zonation patterns were observed, with most striking differences due to the paucity of branching pocilloporid corals in shallow waters(<7 m), where massive corals of Porites predominate. We identified three main 'groups' of sites in terms of the relative abundance of major functional groups and these did not follow geographic arrangement or strict coastline orientation. The similar spatial change in benthic and fish functional community structure documented here suggests there may be strong coupling with coastal oceanographic conditions that varies on scales of 1s-10s of km. Temporal patterns document relatively rapid recovery of total coral cover, largely via compensatory change in relative coral composition with an increase in Porites upon abrupt decline of Pocillopora, following extensive coral mortality caused by thermal stress (coral bleaching) in 2000. Moreover, coral abundance in shallow habitats increased beyond pre-disturbance levels (i.e., 1999-2000). In contrast to shallow habitats, corals again suffered extensive mortality and reduced cover by 2005 at mid-(10-15 m) and deep (>15 m) habitats, with contrasting recovery. These results suggest depth-dependent disturbance regimes that differ in types and frequency of events, as well as capacity to recover. Overall, our results highlight the apparent resilience of the current system and provide a first-cut benchmark as to where management subsystems might be prescribed so as to spatially match ecosystem characteristics.

AB <list list-type="1" id="mee312256-list-0001"> Size spectrum ecological models are representations of a community of individuals which grow and change trophic level. A key emergent feature of these models is the size spectrum; the total abundance of all individuals that scales negatively with size. The models we focus on are designed to capture fish community dynamics useful for assessing the community impacts of fishing. We present mizer, an R package for implementing dynamic size spectrum ecological models of an entire aquatic community subject to fishing. Multiple fishing gears can be defined and fishing mortality can change through time making it possible to simulate a range of exploitation strategies and management options.mizer implements three versions of the size spectrum modelling framework: the community model, where individuals are only characterized by their size; the trait-based model, where individuals are further characterized by their asymptotic size; and the multispecies model where additional trait differences are resolved. A range of plot, community indicator and summary methods are available to inspect the results of the simulations. <doi origin="wiley" registered="yes">10.1111/(ISSN)2041-210X</doi

AB 1. The Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries requires that managers take account of the environmental impacts of fishing. Towed bottom-fishing gears disturb seabed habitats and cause mortality of benthic invertebrates. Measurements of recovery rates of marine habitats after fishing disturbance can provide insight into spatial variations in resilience and may be used to assess the sustainability of these fishing impacts and inform the development of appropriate management strategies.
   2. To measure recovery on real fishing grounds at fishery-and management-relevant scales, we estimated the post-disturbance recovery rates of epifaunal marine benthic communities on coarse and hard substrata across >4000 km(2) of seabed where the patchy distribution of bottom fishing in space and time creates a mosaic of habitat patches at different stages of recovery.
   3. The history of fishing events at each location was described using satellite vessel monitoring system (VMS) data. Recovery rates were extrapolated from the relationship between time since the last fishing event and abundance of epifaunal benthic invertebrates with life-history traits that are expected to make them sensitive to fishing.
   4. Recovery of abundance of all species and functional groups (medium to medium-large size, medium to long life span, suspension feeding, high body flexibility and low mobility species) was estimated to take < 1 to > 10 years, depending on the group, with faster recovery in areas with faster tidal currents.
   5. The recovery of large species was faster when conspecifics were abundant within a radius of 6 km, suggesting an important role for maintaining local sources of recruits to repopulate impacted areas.
   6. Synthesis and applications. We used a new method to estimate the recovery rate of benthic communities and to describe spatial differences in sensitivity to fishing. Bottom fishing in areas that recover quickly will minimize overall impacts, while leaving unfished patches of seabed will enhance recovery rates in fished areas. We conclude that management plans which limit bottom trawls and dredge fisheries to more resilient areas and maintain unfished patches within these areas will minimize the collective impacts of a given amount of fishing effort on seabed habitats.

AB The morphological and biochemical properties of plant canopies are strong predictors of photosynthetic capacity and nutrient cycling. Remote sensing research at the leaf and canopy scales has demonstrated the ability to characterize the biochemical status of vegetation canopies using reflectance spectroscopy, including at the leaf level and canopy level from air- and spaceborne imaging spectrometers. We developed a set of accurate and precise spectroscopic calibrations for the determination of leaf chemistry (contents of nitrogen, area, carbon, and fiber constituents), morphology (leaf mass per area, M-area), and isotopic composition (delta N-15) of temperate and boreal tree species using spectra of dried and ground leaf material. The data set consisted of leaves from both broadleaf and needle-leaf conifer species and displayed a wide range in values, determined with standard analytical approaches: 0.7-4.4% for nitrogen(N-mass), 42-54% for carbon (C-mass), 17-58% for fiber (acid-digestible fiber, ADF), 7-44% for lignin (acid-digestible lignin, ADL), 3-31% for cellulose, 17-265 g/m(2) for M-area, and 9.4 parts per thousand to 0.8 parts per thousand for delta N-15. The calibrations were developed using a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling approach combined with a novel uncertainty analysis. Our PLSR models yielded model calibration (independent validation shown in parentheses) R-2 and the root mean square error (RMSE) values, respectively, of 0.98 (0.97) and 0.10% (0.13%) for N-mass, R-2 = 0.77 (0.73) and RMSE = 0.88% (0.95%) for C-mass, R-2 = 0.89 (0.84) and RMSE=2.8% (3.4%) for ADF, R-2 = 0.77 (0.69) and RMSE = 2.4% (3.9%) for ADL, R-2=0.77 (0.72) and RMSE=1.4% (1.9%) for leaf cellulose, R-2=0.62 (0.60) and RMSE=0.91 parts per thousand (1.5 parts per thousand) for delta N-15, and R-2 = 0.88 (0.87) with RMSE = 17.2 g/m(2) (22.8 g/m(2)) for M-area. This study demonstrates the potential for rapid and accurate estimation of key foliar traits of forest canopies that are important for ecological research and modeling activities, with a single calibration equation valid over a wide range of northern temperate and boreal species and leaf physiognomies. The results provide the basis to characterize important variability between and within species, and across ecological gradients using a rapid, cost-effective, easily replicated method.

AB The elemental composition of organisms has been linked to traits such as growth rates, through investment of phosphorus (P) in RNA (called the Growth Rate Hypothesis) and through ecological processes such as susceptibility to predation and herbivory. To test the predictions of the Growth Rate Hypothesis, we assessed the elemental composition and RNA of four phyla of common, co-occurring benthic coral reef organisms, corals, and green, brown and red macroalgae, whose patterns of dominance are predicted to be strongly influenced by differences in growth and herbivory and thus elemental stoichiometry. We assessed the importance of phylogeny and functional form, two important attributes for predicting the composition of macroalgal communities, on the variation in elemental composition. Over these widely divergent taxonomic groups of organisms, we found support for links between elemental composition and RNA in tissues. The RNA:DNA in corals was positively correlated with % nitrogen (N) and negatively correlated with carbon (C):N ratios of tissues while RNA:DNA and RNA concentrations in macroalgae were positively correlated with %N, N:P ratios and negatively correlated with C:N ratios. Corals had higher concentrations of P and lower C:P ratios than macroalgae. Among the macroalgal lineages, C:P was higher in the brown algae than in red and green algae. Overall, the variation in elemental composition of macroalgae was relatively low compared with the variation reported for terrestrial plants and similar to that in corals. Analysis of phylogenetic sources of variation (family and genus) in elemental composition and RNA found that genus accounted for a significant proportion of variation in both corals and macroalgae (15-47%), but the largest source of variation (50-97%) was unexplained by our statistical model and thus likely attributable to species and environmental factors. Although elemental composition of macroalgae did not vary in a way that was consistent with functional form models, genera with larger thalli had higher tissue N than smaller forms and more lineages with greater complexity of form had lower C:P ratios than less complex brown algal lineages. Our data indicate that the despite relatively low levels of variation in elemental composition compared with terrestrial organisms, elemental stoichiometry varied significantly among coral reef taxa and with the structure of organisms and thus may have potential for predicting variation in growth rates and patterns of consumption on coral reefs.

AB The greater part of the semi-deciduous moist forests of the Congo basin has been given to logging companies for exploitation. In the next decades, very few of these forests will remain intact. In this paper, we aimed to identify large-scale variations in the structure, composition and functioning of African moist forests that could serve as a baseline for both management and conservation purposes. Commercial forest inventory data were assembled for 49,711 0.5-ha plots, covering an area of more than six million hectares, crossing the borders of Cameroon, Central African Republic and Republic of Congo. Floristic composition was analyzed for a subset of 176 genera reliably identified in the field. Three key functional traits of tropical trees: regeneration guild, leaf phenology, and wood specific gravity, were collected at the species level from various sources, and assigned at the genus level. We first investigated the main variations in forest structure and composition, and identified seven forest types based on these variations. Differences in the percentage of pioneer and deciduous stems, and mean wood specific gravity were tested between forest types. Most of the study area was composed of a mosaic of the structural variations of the forests characterized by the occurrence of Celtis (Ulmaceae) species, which are mostly composed of frequent and abundant genera that formed the common floristic pool of the region. Secondary Musanga (Moraceae) forest is located in repeatedly disturbed areas, along roads and around main cities; mixed Manilkara (Sapotaceae) forest covers a huge area in the southern Central African Republic and in the northern Republic of Congo; and monodominant Gilbertiodendron (Fabaceae) forest is sparsely distributed along rivers. The contrasted structure, composition, and functioning of the forest types imply pronounced differences in population and ecosystem processes, and call for adapted management and conservation strategies.

AB We examined the potential importance of distance from the spring source (reach), season, and physicochemical variability on zoobenthic biodiversity, biomass, and trait-based metrics [functional feeding groups (FFG) and habit traits] in three karst spring systems in the Ozarks region of Missouri, USA. Density and biomass were measured during summer and winter in each spring source and three downstream reaches of each springbrook. Nearly 20,000 invertebrates in total were collected, identified, and counted. We measured biomass directly or by length-weight relationships. Overall downstream and seasonal patterns of diversity, biomass, and traits were similar among springs, but species dominance and composition varied significantly. Taxonomic richness increased downstream in all springs, but evenness decreased. Amphipods and isopods were the most abundant taxa at the spring source but were progressively replaced downstream by insects (with dominance varying among springs and seasons). Density and biomass for flatworms, snails, and insects increased downstream, while crustacean numbers diminished along this ecotone. FFG increased from 3 at the spring source (mostly shredders) to 4-7 downstream where scrapers, collectors, and/or predators predominated. Physicochemical factors proved minor at best as mechanistic explanations for ecotonal changes. We conclude that structural and functional community changes could be attributed to a matrix of interrelated factors including organic substrate, food availability, and biotic interactions.

AB Models which use species-specific trade-offs of life-history traits have been widely used to simulate stable, diverse communities of sessile organisms. However, the precise estimation of trade-off parameters required by many models cannot be easily realized for multiple species living within rapidly changing environments. We developed a spatially-explicit model, MCAP, that uses empirically estimated parameters to define species-specific life-history functions. This approach did not require trade-offs to be explicitly stated, but rather intrinsically represented trade-offs within the data structure defining each species life-history functions (e.g., age or size dependent changes in reproduction, dispersal, establishment, mortality and growth). The use of species-specific functions with empirically estimated parameters allowed each species to be uniquely characterized with subsequent estimation of model sensitivities due to changing functional forms or parameter errors. Empirical data was obtained from field observations and experiments for 16 species within tidal freshwater marsh communities of the Chesapeake Bay. Model results compared with these data showed that MCAP realistically represented processes structuring these tidal marsh communities. Model experiments varying weather and the range of habitat conditions accessible to each species showed that patterns of abundance and diversity were most affected by local habitat conditions and neighborhood interactions among competing species. The simulation approach used in MCAP was effective and efficient, providing a comprehensive tool for assessing the simultaneous effects of changing environmental drivers and species composition on the persistence and biodiversity of marsh communities.

AB Dams are known to impact river channels and ecosystems, both during their lifetime and in their decommissioning. In this study, we applied a before-after-control-impact design associated with two small dam removals to investigate abiotic and biotic recovery trajectories from both the elimination of the press disturbance associated with the presence of dams and the introduction of a pulse disturbance associated with removal of dams. The two case studies represent different geomorphic and ecological conditions that we expected to represent low and high sensitivities to the pulse disturbance of dam removal: the 4 m tall, gravel-filled Brownsville Dam on the wadeable Calapooia River and the 12.5 m tall, sand and gravel-filled Savage Rapids Dam on the largely non-wadeable Rogue River. We evaluated both geomorphic and ecological responses annually for two years post removal, and asked if functional traits of the macroinvertebrate assemblages provided more persistent signals of ecological disturbance than taxonomically defined assemblages over the period of study. Results indicate that: 1) the presence of the dams constituted a strong ecological press disturbance to the near-downstream reaches on both rivers, despite the fact that both rivers passed unregulated flow and sediment during the high flow season; 2) ecological recovery from this press disturbance occurred within the year following the restoration action of dam removal, whereas signals of geomorphic disturbance from the pulse of released sediment persisted two years post-removal, and 3) the strength of the press disturbance and the rapid ecological recovery were detected regardless of whether recovery was assessed by taxonomic or functional assemblages and for both case studies, in spite of their different geomorphic settings.

AB Both structural and functional properties of belowground plant organs are critical for the development and yield of plants but, compared to the shoot, much more difficult to observe due to soil opacity. Many processes concerning the belowground plant performance are not fully understood, in particular spatial and temporal dynamics and their interrelation with environmental factors. We used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as a noninvasive method to evaluate which traits can be measured when a complex plant organ is monitored in-vivo while growing in the soil. We chose sugar beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgar's) as a model system. The beet consists mainly of root tissues, is rather complex regarding tissue structure and responses to environmental factors, and thereby a good object to test the applicability of MRI for 3D phenotyping approaches. Over a time period of up to 3 months, traits such as beet morphology or anatomy were followed in the soil and the effect of differently sized pots on beet fresh weight calculated from MRI data was studied. There was a clear positive correlation between the pot size and the increase in fresh weight of a sugar beet over time. Since knowledge of the development of internal beet structures with several concentric cambia, vascular and parenchyma rings is still limited, we consecutively acquired 3D volumetric images on individual plants using the MRI contrast parameter T-2 to map the development of rings at the tissue level. This demonstrates that MRI provides versatile protocols to non-invasively measure plant traits in the soil. It opens new avenues to investigate belowground plant performance under adverse environmental conditions such as drought, nutrient shortage, or soil compaction to seek for traits of belowground organs making plants more resilient to stress.

AB Spatial heterogeneity in habitat conditions within a landscape should influence degree of movement of species between natural and artificial environments. For wetland landscapes, this functional connectivity was predicted to emerge from the influence of spatiotemporal patterns of depth on permeability of habitat edges and distance and directedness of cross-habitat dispersal. We quantified how connectivity between canals and marshes of the Florida Everglades varies with species and landscape patterns bordering canals by using radio telemetry to measure movement of a native (Florida largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides floridanus) and a nonnative species (Mayan cichlid, Cichlasoma urophthalmus) common to canals. Both species moved similar distances inside canal networks, but Mayan cichlids dispersed outside of canals more frequently, at shallower conditions, and over greater distances than Florida largemouth bass. As topographic relief increased in marshes bordering canals, dispersal between these habitats decreased in distance and became more directed, with Florida largemouth bass sensitive to depth variability at a smaller spatial scale than Mayan cichlids. The way fish traits interact with submerged landscape structure to influence connectivity can serve as a basis for predicting potential impacts of artificial habitats that arise from dispersal outside their borders.

AB The combination of changing climate and anthropogenic activities is increasing the probability of wildfire around the world. When fires occur in riparian zones, associated tree mortality can add wood directly to streams or wood may fall to the forest floor and remain there for some time before being transported into stream channels. Wood provides critical structure for aquatic macroinvertebrates, so our objectives were to assess the effects of wood burn status, conditioning, and their interaction on macroinvertebrate community composition, taxon and functional diversity, and trait affinities. We conducted a field experiment with pieces of freshly cut wood (length = 10 cm, diameter approximate to 7.5 cm) for which we first manipulated burn status (burned, unburned) and then, conditioned by placing burned and unburned wood directly into streams (no conditioning) or by leaving pieces in streams (water conditioning) or on the forest floor (soil conditioning) for a year before submergence. We used distance-based redundancy analysis to assess community structure by wood treatments and linear mixed-effects modeling to assess effects of wood treatments on taxon and functional diversity and trait affinity. Changes in wood quality resulting from fire may not alter macroinvertebrate community structure. Taxonomic and functional patterns of stream invertebrate colonization did not differ between burned and unburned wood, even after a year of incubation in the stream or on the forest floor. Conditioning status affected taxonomic composition, taxon and functional diversity, and trait affinities of wood invertebrate communities. The terrestrial legacy of soil conditioning was clearly important in structuring macroinvertebrate assemblages. Our results suggest that macroinvertebrate communities may be more sensitive to fire effects on the dynamics of wood input than to effects of fires on the wood itself.

AB Mountaintop mining (MTM) affects chemical, physical, and hydrological properties of receiving streams, but the long-term consequences for fish-assemblage structure and function are poorly understood. We sampled stream fish assemblages using electrofishing techniques in MTM exposure sites and reference sites within the Guyandotte River basin, USA, during 2010-2011. We calculated indices of taxonomic diversity (species richness, abundance, Shannon diversity) and functional diversity (functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence) to compare exposure and reference assemblages between seasons (spring and autumn) and across years (1999-2011). We based temporal comparisons on 2 sites that were sampled during 1999-2001 by Stauffer and Ferreri (2002). Exposure assemblages had lower taxonomic and functional diversity than reference assemblages or simulated assemblages that accounted for random variation. Differences in taxonomic composition between reference and exposure assemblages were associated with conductivity and aqueous Se concentrations. Exposure assemblages had fewer species, lower abundances, and less biomass than reference assemblages across years and seasons. Green Sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) and Creek Chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) became numerically dominant in exposure assemblages over time because of their persistence and losses of other taxa. In contrast, species richness increased over time in reference assemblages, a result that may indicate recovery from drought. Mean individual biomass increased as fish density decreased and most obligate invertivores were apparently extirpated at MTM exposure sites. Effects of MTM were not related to physical-habitat conditions but were associated with water-quality variables, which may limit quality and availability of benthic macroinvertebrate prey. Simulations revealed effects of MTM that could not be attributed to random variation in fish assemblage structure.

AB Body shapes of aquatic insect larvae reflect phenotypic responses to complex environmental conditions and can be used to infer habitat properties and indicate natural and anthropogenic perturbations in river ecosystems. Investigation of relationships between body shape and physical-habitat characteristics has been restricted by a lack of an objective schema for quantitative characterization of body-shape variation. We present a functional ecological framework for body-shape classification based on defined criteria. We applied a geometric morphometric (GM) approach to the general classification of body shape in 4 morphologically diverse orders, Ephemeroptera (E), Plecoptera (P), Trichoptera (T), and Odonata (O) collected from 3 sites with contrasting hydrological and hydraulic characteristics. We describe a robust classification of body shapes for E, P, and O, which possess a compartmentalized body plan, and suggest a preliminary classification for T. We compared GM body shapes with body-shape trait states available in trait databases and found discordance between the 2 classifications. We explored the value of GM body shapes to describe taxon shape structure of reference sites and to detect variation reflecting physical properties of the sites. GM body-shape classes can augment the trait states already available and enhance inference regarding habitat status. Patterns in the shape strategies of aquatic insects, particularly EPO taxa, can be used to extrapolate shape information for other taxonomic groups. GM provides a stable shape classification that can contribute to the description of different ecological strategies of aquatic insects. Expanding the scope of shape information available for many taxonomic groups can improve our understanding of how organism phenotype relates to environmental conditions and supports traits-based assessment.

AB Availability of macrophyte habitat is recognized as an important driver of aquatic insect communities in peatland drainage ditches; however, eutrophication can lead to the decline of submerged vegetation. While emergent vegetation is able to persist in eutrophicated ditches, vegetation removal, carried out during ditch maintenance, can reduce the availability of this habitat. In this study, we applied the landscape filtering approach to determine whether the absence of emergent vegetation is a habitat filter which structures aquatic insect communities in peatland drainage ditches under different trophic conditions. To this end, a field study was carried out in one mesotrophic (Naardermeer) and one eutrophic (Wormer and Jisperveld) peatland in the province of North Holland, The Netherlands. We assigned life history strategies to insect species and applied linear mixed models and redundancy analyses to taxonomic and functional aquatic insect community data. Our results indicate that while differences between peatlands primarily determine the species pool within each wetland, emergent vegetation acted as a secondary filter by structuring functional community composition within ditches. The eutrophic peatland was dominated by insects adapted to abiotic extremes, while species with good dispersal abilities were strongly related to emergent vegetation cover. This study demonstrates the applicability of life history strategies to provide insight into the filtering of species due to availability of emergent macrophyte habitat. To ensure greater diversity of insect communities in ditch habitats, it is recommended that some vegetation be spared during maintenance to leave patches from which insect recolonization can occur.

AB Aim Many factors facilitate biological invasions, making it difficult to determine their relative importance, especially when relying on survey data that include confounded variables. Incorporating information about species characteristics can improve inferences drawn from species-environment relationships, which can inform management. We seek to understand why the abundance of exotic, and not native, terrestrial plants is higher in riparian wetlands most impacted by flow regulation.
   Location River Murray, SE Australia.
   Methods We use variance components analysis and hierarchical generalised linear models to examine whether the positive relationship between flow regulation and proportional cover of exotic plants is driven by altered hydrological regimes, wetland drying and drought, superior colonisation ability of exotic species following disturbance or human-increased propagule pressure.
   Results Of the four hypotheses, hydrological modification (indicated by flood magnitude) most likely drives invasion. Flow regulation may inhibit native species adapted to the historical hydrological regime, facilitating exotic species with different environmental ranges. A symptom of environmental change, invasion may have been exacerbated by drought, although it is unclear why. There was no indication that human-increased propagule pressure or colonisation ability facilitated invasion. Exotic cover was unrelated to proximity to towns, recent flood frequency and cattle grazing intensity. Additionally, similar proportions of exotic and native species were used in cultivation and, despite a higher proportion of exotics being known weeds, weed status was unrelated to exotic species occupancy. Overall, colonisation ability was unrelated to species' origin or response to water depth and hydrological change. Although exotics had higher specific leaf area and shorter longevity (indicative of higher colonisation ability), they had heavier (not lighter) seeds and did not differ in height from natives.
   Main conclusions Using environmental flows to reinstate mid-range floods and augmenting the propagule supply of native species with characteristics suitable for modified conditions may help limit invasion in these wetlands.

AB The sensitivity of diatom taxonomy and trait-based endpoints to chemicals has been poorly used so far in Environmental Risk Assessment. In this study, diatom assemblages in outdoor flow-through mesocosms were exposed to thiram (35 and 170 mu g/L), and a hydrocarbon emulsion (HE; 0.01, 0.4, 2 and 20 mg/L). The effects of exposure were assessed for 12 weeks, including 9 weeks post-treatment, using taxonomic structure and diversity, bioindication indices, biological traits, functional diversity indices, indicator classes and ecological guilds. For both chemicals, diversity increased after the treatment period, and responses of ecological traits were roughly identical with an abundance increase of motile taxa tolerant to organic pollution and decrease of low profile taxa. Bioindication indices were not affected. Traits provided a complementary approach to biomass measurements and taxonomic descriptors, leading to a more comprehensive overview of ecological changes due to organic chemicals, including short- and long-term effects on biofilm structure and functioning.

AB Leaf traits are determinants of plant performance in ecosystems. The arid Minjiang River valley offer optimal opportunity to reveal climate-leaf function relationship because steep climatic gradients (e.g., dryness and high temperature decreased with elevation). We investigated the leaf size and structure of Campylotropis polyantha occurring in five 80-100 m elevational bands from 1650 m to 2200 m in this arid valley. Plants growing at higher elevations had larger leaves, epidermal cell and leaf thickness with thicker spongy mesophyll and epidermis, but had lower epidermal cell density and cutin thickness. These variations in leaf size and spongy mesophyll as well as cutin and total leaf thickness were mainly associated with annual precipitation and soil water content, while epidermal cell dimensions were associated with temperature. We conclude that water-related factors are the main mechanisms underlying leaf variations across elevations. High air temperature during the growing season imposes multiple stresses on plants at low elevations. The larger leaf size of high elevation plants is related more to their larger spongy mesophyll and epidermal cell sizes than to their larger palisade cell. These results provide a new understanding of functional ecology and the anatomical plasticity of plants in varying environments with different elevations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Taxonomic characterization of environmental microbial communities via high-throughput DNA sequencing has revealed that patterns in microbial biogeography affect community structure. However, shifts in functional diversity related to variation in taxonomic composition are poorly understood. To overcome limitations due to the prohibitive cost of high-depth metagenomic sequencing, tools to infer functional diversity based on phylogenetic distributions of functional traits have been developed. In this study we characterized functional microbial diversity at 11 sites along the Mississippi River in Minnesota using both metagenomic sequencing and functional-inference-based (PICRUSt) approaches. This allowed us to determine how distance and variation in land cover throughout the river influenced the distribution of functional traits, as well as to validate PICRUSt inferences. The distribution and abundance of functional traits, by metagenomic analysis, were similar among sites, with a median standard deviation of 0.0002% among tier 3 functions in KEGG. Overall inferred functional variation was significantly different (P <= 0.035) between two water basins surrounded by agricultural vs. developed land cover, and abundances of bacterial orders that correlated with functional traits by metagenomic analysis were greater where abundances of the trait were inferred to be higher. PICRUSt inferences were significantly correlated (r = 0.147, P = 1.80 x 10(-30)) with metagenomic annotations. Discrepancies between metagenomic and PICRUSt taxonomic-functional relationships, however, suggested potential functional redundancy among abundant and rare taxa that impeded the ability to accurately assess unique functional traits among rare taxa at this sequencing depth. Results of this study suggest that a suite of "core functional traits" is conserved throughout the river and distributions of functional traits, rather than specific taxa, may shift in response to environmental heterogeneity.

AB Subsurface sediments of the Sonora Margin (Guayma Basin), located in proximity of active cold seep sites were explored. The taxonomic and functional diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities were investigated from 1 to 10 meters below the seafloor. Microbial community structure and abundance and distribution of dominant populations were assessed using complementary molecular approaches (Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis, 16S rRNA libraries and quantitative PCR with an extensive primers set) and correlated to comprehensive geochemical data. Moreover the metabolic potentials and functional traits of the microbial community were also identified using the GeoChip functional gene microarray and metabolic rates. The active microbial community structure in the Sonora Margin sediments was related to deep subsurface ecosystems (Marine Benthic Groups B and D, Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group, Chloroflexi and Candidate divisions) and remained relatively similar throughout the sediment section, despite defined biogeochemical gradients. However, relative abundances of bacterial and archaeal dominant lineages were significantly correlated with organic carbon quantity and origin. Consistently, metabolic pathways for the degradation and assimilation of this organic carbon as well as genetic potentials for the transformation of detrital organic matters, hydrocarbons and recalcitrant substrates were detected, suggesting that chemoorganotrophic microorganisms may dominate the microbial community of the Sonora Margin subsurface sediments.

AB Bats are well known for species richness and ecological diversity, and thus, they provide a good opportunity to study relationships and interaction between species. To assess interactions, we consider distinct traits that are probably to be triggered by niche shape and evolutionary processes. We present data on the trophic niche differentiation between two sympatric European trawling bat species, Myotis dasycneme and Myotis daubentonii, incorporating a wide spectrum of methodological approaches. We measure morphological traits involved in foraging and prey handling performance including bite force, weightlifting capacity and wing morphology. We then measure resulting prey consumption using both morphological and molecular diet analyses. These species closely resemble each other in morphological traits, however, subtle but significant differences were apparent in bite force and lift capacity, which are related to differences in basic body and head size. Both morphological and molecular diet analyses show strong niche overlap. We detected subtle differences in less frequent prey items, as well as differences in the exploitation of terrestrial and aquatic-based prey groups. Myotis dasycneme feeds more on aquatic prey, like Chironomidae and their pupal stages, or on the aquatic moth Acentria ephemerella. Myotis daubentonii feeds more on terrestrial prey, like Brachycera, or Coleoptera. This suggests that these bats use different microhabitats within the habitat where they co-occur.

AB Sensitive biological measures of river ecosystem quality are needed to assess, maintain or restore ecological conditions of water bodies. Since our understanding of these complex systems is imperfect, decision-making requires recognizing uncertainty. In this study, a new predictive multi-metric index based on fish functional traits was developed to assess French rivers. Information on fish assemblage structure, local environment and human-induced disturbances of 1654 French river sites was compiled. A Bayesian framework was used to predict theoretical metric values in absence of human pressure and to estimate the uncertainty associated with these predictions. The uncertainty associated with the index score gives the confidence associated with the evaluation of site ecological conditions.
   Among the 228 potential metrics tested, only 11 were retained for the index computation. The final index is independent from natural variability and sensitive to human-induced disturbances. In particular, it is affected by the accumulation of different degradations and specific degradations including hydrological perturbations. Predictive uncertainty is globally lower for IPR+ than for underlying metrics.
   This new methodology seems appropriate to develop bio-indication tools accounting for uncertainty related to reference condition definition and could be extended to other biological groups and areas. Our results support the use of multi-metric indexes to assess rivers and strengthen the idea that examination of uncertainty could contribute greatly to the improvement of the assessment power of bio-indicators.

AB Reliable ecosystem quality assessment of marine environments is increasingly important due to mounting pressures attributable to human activities. Biotic indices are widely used in studies to describe communities and indicate the ecological state of systems. This study focuses on benthic macroinvertebrate-based biotic indices for the assessment of ecosystem health. Indices used in ecosystem health assessment in the marine environment have mainly focussed on measuring structural components of the system while more recently the measurement of functional components has been highlighted. In this study the performance of traditional diversity indices based on structural components of benthic macroinvertebrate communities, indices developed for the EU Water Framework Directive, and indices which are based on functional biological traits of species were compared. The results indicated that while functional indices may provide a more detailed assessment of the benthic communities than structural indices, the overall outcome is broadly similar for both types of indices. This suggests measurement of functional indices may be unnecessary for routine monitoring purposes, although they may have value in revealing more specific aspects of change in a system.

AB Ecological divergence is thought to be coupled with evolutionary radiations, yet the strength of this coupling is unclear. When birds diversified ecologically has received much less attention than their hotly debated crown divergence time. Here, we quantify how accurately skeletal morphology can predict ecology in living and extinct birds, and show that the earliest known assemblage of birds (=pygostylians) from the Jehol Biota (approximate to 125 Ma) was substantially impoverished ecologically. The Jehol avifauna has few representatives of highly preservable ecomorphs (e. g. aquatic forms) and a notable lack of ecomorphological overlap with the pterosaur assemblage (e. g. no large or aerially foraging pygostylians). Comparisons of the Jehol functional diversity with modern and subfossil avian assemblages show that taphonomic bias alone cannot explain the ecomorphological impoverishment. However, evolutionary simulations suggest that the constrained ecological diversity of the Early Cretaceous pygostylians is consistent with what is expected from a relatively young radiation. Regardless of the proximate biological explanation, the anomalously low functional diversity of the Jehol birds is evidence both for ecological vacancies in Cretaceous ecosystems, which were subsequently filled by the radiation of crown Aves, and for discordance between taxonomic richness and ecological diversity in the best-known Mesozoic ecosystem.

AB Watershed-scale anthropogenic stressors have profound effects on aquatic communities. Although several functional traits of stream macroinvertebrates change predictably in response to land development and urbanization, little is known about macroinvertebrate functional responses in lakes. We assessed functional community structure, functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy) and voltinism in macroinvertebrate communities sampled across the full gradient of anthropogenic stress in Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Functional diversity and voltinism significantly decreased with increasing development, whereas agriculture had smaller or non-significant effects. Functional community structure was affected by watershed-scale development, as demonstrated by an ordination analysis followed by regression. Because functional community structure affects energy flow and ecosystem function, and functional diversity is known to have important implications for ecosystem resilience to further environmental change, these results highlight the necessity of finding ways to remediate or at least ameliorate these effects.

AB Question: Ecologists are increasingly interested in making accurate predictions of plant response to climate change. Many studies have attempted to document plant response to warming by grouping species into functional groups. Within functional groups, however, species often display divergent responses. Determining how foliar functional traits might be used to predict plant responses to warming could reduce analytical complexity while maintaining generalizations across systems.
   Methods: We conducted ameta-analysis on 18 studies (consisting of 38 species) of plant biomass response to experimental or natural warming. We determined whether plant trait estimates associated with the leaf economics spectrum [leaf life span (LL), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen (N-mass), leaf phosphorus (P-mass), photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) and stomatal conductance (G(s))] from a global plant database of experimentally unmanipulated plants, GloPNet, could be used to predict biomass response to experimental warming.
   Results: We found that three single leaf traits (LL, Nmass and Amax) were significant predictors for the response of plant biomass to warming treatments, perhaps due to their association with plant growth rates, adaptation rate and ability, each explaining between 21-46% of the variation in plant biomass responses. The magnitude of response to warming decreased with increasing LL, but increased with increasing Nmass and Amax. We found no linear combination of any of these traits that predicted warming response.
   Conclusions: These results show that foliar traits can aid in understanding the mechanisms by which plants respond to temperature across species. Because each trait only explained a portion of variation in how plant growth responded to warming, however, future studies that examine how plant communities respond to warming should simultaneously measure multiple leaf traits, especially those most sensitive to warming, across plant species, to determine whether the predictive ability of functional traits changes between different ecosystems or plant taxonomic groups.

AB Climate warming in arctic tundra may shift dominant vegetation from graminoids to deciduous shrubs, whose functional traits could, in turn, alter biotic and abiotic controls over biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). We investigated whether shrub-induced changes in microclimate have stronger effects on litter decomposition and nutrient release than changes in litter quality and quantity. In arctic tundra near Toolik Lake, Alaska, USA, we incubated a common substrate in a snow-addition experiment to test whether snow accumulation around arctic deciduous shrubs altered the environment enough to increase litter decomposition rates. We compared the influence of litter quality on the rate of litter and N loss by decomposing litter from four different plant functional types in a common site. We used aboveground net primary production values and estimated decay constant (k) values from our decomposition experiments to calculate community-weighted mass loss for each site. Snow addition had no effect on decomposition of the common substrate, and the site with the highest abundance of shrubs had the lowest decomposition rates. Species varied in their decomposition rates, with species from the same functional type not always following similar patterns. Community-weighted mass loss was 1.5 times greater in the high shrub site, and only slightly decreased when adjusted for soil environment, suggesting that litter quality and quantity are the primary drivers of community decomposition. Our findings suggest that on a short time scale, the changes in soil environment associated with snow trapping by shrubs are unlikely to influence litter nutrient turnover enough to drive positive snow-shrub feedbacks. The mechanisms driving shrub expansion are more likely to do with shrub-litter feedbacks, where the higher growth rates and N uptake by shrubs allows them to produce more leaves, resulting in a larger litter N pool and faster internal cycling of nutrients.

AB The Salmoniform whole-genome duplication is hypothesized to have facilitated the evolution of anadromy, but little is known about the contribution of paralogs from this event to the physiological performance traits required for anadromy, such as salinity tolerance. Here, we determined when two candidate, salinity-responsive paralogs of the Na+, K+ ATPase a subunit (alpha 1a and alpha 1b) evolved and studied their evolutionary trajectories and tissue-specific expression patterns. We found that these paralogs arose during a small-scale duplication event prior to the Salmoniform, but after the teleost, whole-genome duplication. The 'freshwater paralog' (alpha 1a) is primarily expressed in the gills of Salmoniformes and an unduplicated freshwater sister species (Esox lucius) and experienced positive selection in the freshwater ancestor of Salmoniformes and Esociformes. Contrary to our predictions, the 'saltwater paralog' (alpha 1b), which is more widely expressed than alpha 1a, did not experience positive selection during the evolution of anadromy in the Coregoninae and Salmonine. To determine whether parallel mutations in Na+, K+ ATPase alpha 1 may contribute to salinity tolerance in other fishes, we studied independently evolved salinity-responsive Na+, K+ ATPase alpha 1 paralogs in Anabas testudineus and Oreochromis mossambicus. We found that a quarter of the mutations occurring between salmonid alpha 1a and alpha 1b in functionally important sites also evolved in parallel in at least one of these species. Together, these data argue that paralogs contributing to salinity tolerance evolved prior to the Salmoniform whole-genome duplication and that strong selection and/or functional constraints have led to parallel evolution in salinity-responsive Na+, K+ ATPase alpha 1 paralogs in fishes.

AB Recent increases in biological invasions frequency may have important consequences on native communities. However, functional redundancy between invasive and native species could reduce nonnative species effects on native ecosystems. Despite this, even small differences in functional traits between these species may still have unpredictable effects on colonized ecosystems. Invasive crayfish, as ecosystem engineers, potentially have wide and complex effects on recipient ecosystems, even when replacing a native counterpart. We used laboratory microcosms to test whether native (Astacus astacus) and invasive crayfish species (Orconectes limosus, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii) are actually functionally redundant in their effects on prey/shredder density and leaf litter breakdown. Results show that crayfish strongly influenced macroinvertebrate numbers and leaf litter breakdown and indicate that differences in direct (prey and leaf litter consumption) and indirect (prey habitat use and leaf litter breakdown) effects between crayfish species do exist. While the replacement of A. astacus by O. limosus may have induced only minor changes in freshwater ecosystems, invasions by the larger and more aggressive P. clarkii and P. leniusculus will likely have strong effects on invaded ecosystem. Overall, there seems to be no functional redundancy between these four species and outcomes of crayfish invasion will likely be species specific.

AB Monaghan and Soares (2014) suggested that combining traits with log-transformed abundance of taxa may cause anomalies in analyses of stream macroinvertebrate communities. While they addressed an important issue in stream ecology, here we present an opposite view. To identify the causes of these contrasting opinions, we carefully examined the examples provided by Monaghan and Soares (2014) and demonstrated how traits can be weighted by the presence, abundance and log-transformed abundance of the taxa in a meaningful way. We found that Monaghan and Soares (2014), following other authors, use the term weighting' differently from classical papers of stream ecology. The general practice is to calculate the sum of trait values multiplied by the abundance of each taxon and divide it by the total invertebrate abundance to get a community-level trait value. In contrast, Monaghan and Soares (2014) did not perform the final division and consequently did not get a standardised community-level trait value. It follows that the term weighting' is used with different meanings in stream ecology, and ecologists should keep these differences in mind. We agree with Monaghan and Soares (2014) that the addition of log-transformed data is equivalent to multiplication on an arithmetic scale. However, we disagree that this provides an inconsistent scaling that confounds quantitative analyses. Using example data sets, we illustrate how trait-based data analysis can be performed in community ecology in a meaningful way.

AB Active organisms modify the substratum in which they dwell. This process, called "bioturbation", affects the way that biogeochemical fluxes are mediated at the substratum-water interface. In the frame of this work, the bioturbation potential of the Asiatic clam Corbicula fluminea was characterized and quantified. We measured the displacement of fluorescent particles by C. fluminea burying in a size-based experimental design in order to explore the effects of body-size on sediment reworking. Our results stress that C. fluminea belongs to the functional group of biodiffusors, and that C. fluminea can be considered as an intermediate sediment reworker. We suggest that bioturbation was mainly induced by the pedal-feeding activity of the clams. Results also showed that, though large clams induced displacement of particles deeper into the sediment, small clams showed the highest net sediment reworking activity. This result was in contrast to the initial hypothesis of biovolume as the main driver for particle displacement by bioturbating organisms. Life-history traits and specific features of pedal-feeding could explain the observed pattern.

AB It has been proposed that communities change from r to K strategies during primary succession. However, because strong-flying organisms are expected to arrive first in newly created habitats and they show trait characteristics associated more often with K strategies, we hypothesized that the r to K trajectories would be more closely followed by flightless and poorly-flying organisms. Moreover, we expected that macroinvertebrate communities would converge in their functional composition due to deterministic forces while diverging as taxonomic assemblages due to stochastic drift and biotic interactions. However, we also expected that dispersal abilities of the organisms would affect these tendencies. To address these issues, macroinvertebrates were sampled from isolated manmade ponds of different ages (1-22 years old) constructed at reclaimed opencast coal mines. In accordance with our expectations, only flightless and poorly-flying organisms exhibited a slight shift from r to K strategies, the community taxonomically diverged along the primary succession gradient, and stochastic drift showed greater effects on strong-flying organisms. In contrast, the community did not converge in its functional composition. The weak differences observed among the macroinvertebrates from ponds of different ages suggested that limiting environmental conditions prevented the organisms from evolving to a more structured community.

AB Adaptive variation in the craniofacial skeleton is a key component of resource specialization and habitat divergence in vertebrates, but the proximate genetic mechanisms that underlie complex patterns of craniofacial variation are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway mediates widespread variation across a complex functional system that affects the kinematics of lower jaw depression-the opercular four-bar linkage apparatus-among Lake Malawi cichlids. By using a combined quantitative trait locus mapping and population genetics approach, we show that allelic variation in the Hh receptor, ptch1, affects the development of distinct bony elements in the head that represent two of three movable links in this functional system. The evolutionarily derived allele is found in species that feed from the water column, and is associated with shifts in anatomy that translate to a four-bar system capable of faster jaw rotation. Alternatively, the ancestral allele is found in species that feed on attached algae, and is associated with the development of a four-bar system that predicts slower jaw movement. Experimental manipulation of the Hh pathway during cichlid development recapitulates functionally salient natural variation in craniofacial geometry. In all, these results significantly extend our understanding of the mechanisms that fine-tune the craniofacial skeletal complex during adaptation to new foraging niches.

AB Greater predator body size is often associated with greater predation risk. According to the threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis, prey should display graded responses to increasing predator body size; in turn, these differences in behaviour should also cause differing indirect effects. Yet, in aquatic systems, where prey often use chemical cues to judge predator threats, the role of chemically mediated perception of predator body size and the propagation of indirect effects are still unclear. To differentiate intraspecific predator size via chemical cues, prey must judge predator threat quantitatively (i.e. via concentration) or qualitatively (i.e. via differing cues and/or diets). We investigated the role of individual and aggregate predator body size (i.e. biomass, cue concentration) and qualitative diet cues in antipredator behaviour and indirect interactions by examining the behavioural responses of the mud crab Panopeus herbstii and the survival of oyster prey (Crassostrea virginica) in response to various blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, biomass and diet treatments. Mud crabs increased their refuge use and decreased foraging in response to chemical cues from large, but not small, individual blue crabs. The perception of predator size appeared to be related to predator biomass as multiple small blue crabs and large crabs elicited similar foraging responses in mud crabs. However, multiple small blue crabs failed to affect mud crab refuge use, indicating that some measures of behaviour may not always be predictive of indirect effects. Predator diet also influenced mud crab behaviour and foraging: predators fed mud crabs elicited a greater antipredator response than crushed conspecifics or predators fed oyster diets, suggesting that qualitative cues also influence intraspecific threat perception and indirect interactions. These experiments demonstrate that we cannot successfully predict indirect interactions without considering predator population size structure and measuring indirect effects.

AB Understanding and disentangling different processes underlying the assembly and diversity of communities remains a key challenge in ecology. Species can assemble into communities either randomly or due to deterministic processes. Deterministic assembly leads to species being more similar (underdispersed) or more different (overdispersed) in certain traits than would be expected by chance. However, the relative importance of those processes is not well understood for many organisms, including terrestrial invertebrates. Based on knowledge of a broad range of species traits, we tested for the presence of trait underdispersion (indicating dispersal or environmental filtering) and trait overdispersion (indicating niche partitioning) and their relative importance in explaining land snail community composition on lake islands. The analysis of community assembly was performed using a functional diversity index (Rao's quadratic entropy) in combination with a null model approach. Regression analysis with the effect sizes of the assembly tests and environmental variables gave information on the strength of under- and overdispersion along environmental gradients. Additionally, we examined the link between community weighted mean trait values and environmental variables using a CWM-RDA. We found both trait underdispersion and trait overdispersion, but underdispersion (eight traits) was more frequently detected than overdispersion (two traits). Underdispersion was related to four environmental variables (tree cover, habitat diversity, productivity of ground vegetation, and location on an esker ridge). Our results show clear evidence for underdispersion in traits driven by environmental filtering, but no clear evidence for dispersal filtering. We did not find evidence for overdispersion of traits due to diet or body size, but overdispersion in shell shape may indicate niche differentiation between snail species driven by small-scale habitat heterogeneity. The use of species traits enabled us to identify key traits involved in snail community assembly and to detect the simultaneous occurrence of trait underdispersion and overdispersion.

AB The response of communities to climate extremes can be quite variable. Much of this variation has been attributed to differences in community-specific functional trait diversity, as well as community composition. Yet, few if any studies have explicitly tested the response of the functional trait structure of communities following climate extremes (CEs). Recently in South Florida, two independent, but sequential potential CEs took place, a 2010 cold front, followed by a 2011 drought, both of which had profound impacts on a subtropical estuarine fish community. These CEs provided an opportunity to test whether the structure of South Florida fish communities following each extreme was a result of species-specific differences in functional traits. From historical temperature (1927-2012) and freshwater inflows records into the estuary (1955-2012), we determined that the cold front was a statistically extreme disturbance, while the drought was not, but rather a decadal rare disturbance. The two disturbances predictably affected different parts of functional community structure and thus different component species. The cold front virtually eliminated tropical species, including large-bodied snook, mojarra species, nonnative cichlids, and striped mullet, while having little affect on temperate fishes. Likewise, the drought severely impacted freshwater fishes including Florida gar, bowfin, and two centrarchids, with little effect on euryhaline species. Our findings illustrate the ability of this approach to predict and detect both the filtering effects of different types of disturbances and the implications of the resulting changes in community structure. Further, we highlight the value of this approach to developing predictive frameworks for better understanding community responses to global change.

AB Robust physiology of Myrica cerifera across a chronosequence (i.e., space for time substitution) of shrub thicket age classes contributes to rapid cover expansion observed in the last 50 years.
   Many studies have documented the causes of woody expansion into grasslands, but few address unique morphological and physiological traits that facilitate expansion. Myrica cerifera, an evergreen N-fixer, is the dominant shrub on many barrier islands of the southeastern United States. Cover of Myrica cerifera has expanded by similar to 400 % on Hog Island, Virginia, in the past 50 years. Accretion of the northern end of the island has resulted in a chronosequence (i.e., space for time substitution) of both soil age and shrub thicket development. We investigated functional traits and physiological parameters related to light capture, processing and water balance of M. cerifera across shrub thickets of four age classes from similar to 10 to similar to 50 years. We hypothesized that light processing capabilities and hydraulic capacity would be reduced with thicket age. Spatial variation in morphology (i.e., leaf thickness, leaf area) and structure (i.e., leaf angle) related to light capture was observed. Yet, little or no differences were detected in stomatal density, photosynthetic pigments, electron transport rate (ETR) and hydraulic conductivity across sites. Previous research has shown declines in leaf N content, productivity and leaf litter production across the chronosequence. In contrast, we observed that physiology remains consistent despite considerable differences in thicket age and development. Myrica cerifera maintains high photosynthetic and hydraulic efficiency, factors which enable expansion and maintenance of shrub thickets in mesic coastal environments.

AB The cultivation of rice (Oryza sativa L.), a major food crop, requires ample water (30 % of the fresh water available worldwide), and its productivity is greatly affected by drought, the most significant environmental factor. Much research has focussed on identifying quantitative trait loci, stress-regulated genes and transcription factors that will contribute towards the development of climate-resilient/tolerant crop plants in general and rice in particular. The transcription factor DREB1A, identified from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, has been reported to enhance stress tolerance against drought stress. We developed transgenic rice plants with AtDREB1A in the background of indica rice cultivar Samba Mahsuri through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The AtDREB1A gene was stably inherited and expressed in T-1 and T-2 plants and in subsequent generations, as indicated by the results of PCR, Southern blot and RT-PCR analyses. Expression of AtDREB1A was induced by drought stress in transgenic rice lines, which were highly tolerant to severe water deficit stress in both the vegetative and reproductive stages without affecting their morphological or agronomic traits. The physiological studies revealed that the expression of AtDREB1A was associated with an increased accumulation of the osmotic substance proline, maintenance of chlorophyll, increased relative water content and decreased ion leakage under drought stress. Most of the homozygous lines were highly tolerant to drought stress and showed significantly a higher grain yield and spikelet fertility relative to the nontransgenic control plants under both stressed and unstressed conditions. The improvement in drought stress tolerance in combination with agronomic traits is very essential in high premium indica rice cultivars, such as Samba Mahsuri, so that farmers can benefit in times of seasonal droughts and water scarcity.

AB There is a growing need to understand the functional implications of anthropogenic pressures, such as those following coastal disposal of dredged material. Current assessments, based on taxonomic structure of benthic organisms, only provide a limited capacity to determine functional impacts or recovery. This study assesses recovery of two intertidal dredged material recharge schemes, comparing results obtained based on taxonomic structure (univariate and multivariate approaches) and function (biological trait composition, functional diversity, secondary production) of the benthic assemblages.
   The assemblages recolonising both schemes were consistently less speciose, less densely-populated and exhibited multivariate community structures that differed from those of the reference areas. However, for both schemes metrics of functionality converged to those of reference areas, although some differences in trait composition persisted for up to 3 years.
   These data support the proposition that impacts of, and recovery from, anthropogenic disturbance should be assessed using a combination of both functional and taxonomic structural approaches. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This model of stream epilithic biofilm biomass dynamics is based on the system of equations from Uehlinger etal. () and the term for autogenic detachment of biofilm from Bouletreau etal. (). Its new features are (i) a mathematical term based on estimated feeding activity of biofilm-dwelling invertebrates, (ii) local hydrodynamics considered as the principal factor governing algal traits and biofilm structure and (iii) a variable degree of parameterisation that was adjusted to biofilm biomass conditions.
   Biofilm biomass was monitored over a one-year period in the Garonne river in France (September 2008-2009). An allometric approach was used to estimate the feeding activity of biofilm-dwelling invertebrates based on their energetic requirements. Diatom functional diversity was also monitored to find how it varied with overall biofilm growth patterns. The one-year monitoring period was divided into six biofilm biomass cycles, with each cycle consisting of a phase of biofilm growth as the main process, followed by detachment.
   This model reproduced the observed data as a complex of biofilm growth/detachment cycles using different sets of empirical parameters which allowed (i) the dominant processes involved in each biofilm cycle to be evaluated and (ii) the six cycles of biofilm growth/detachment to be reproduced. This accounted for the observed patterns more effectively than a parameterisation using a single set of empirical parameters.
   High flow had a severe effect on biofilm dynamics through chronic and catastrophic detachment. Presumably as a result, assemblages of diatoms shifted towards species that were firmly attached and protected by mucilage.
   During low flow (and when temperature was high), biofilm dynamics was mainly affected by autogenic detachment and grazer activity. The grazing pressure of the dominant biofilm-dwelling invertebrates (Nematoda and larvae of Chironomidae and Trichoptera) was fairly low (a maximum of 6% of biofilm biomass ingested daily); nevertheless, their presence in the biofilm seemed to favour biofilm autogenic detachment.

AB Studies of the African Middle Stone Age (MSA) have become central for defining the cultural adaptations that accompanied the evolution of modern humans. While much of recent research in South Africa has focused on the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort (HP), periods following these technocomplexes were often neglected. Here we examine lithic assemblages from Sibudu that post-date the HP to further the understanding of MSA cultural variability during the Late Pleistocene. Sibudu preserves an exceptionally thick, rich, and high-resolution archaeological sequence that dates to similar to 58 ka, which has recently been proposed as type assemblage for the "Sibudan''. This study presents a detailed analysis of the six uppermost lithic assemblages from these deposits (BM-BSP) that we excavated from 2011-2013. We define the key elements of the lithic technology and compare our findings to other assemblages post-dating the HP. The six lithic assemblages provide a distinct and robust cultural signal, closely resembling each other in various technological, techno-functional, techno-economic, and typological characteristics. These results refute assertions that modern humans living after the HP possessed an unstructured and unsophisticated MSA lithic technology. While we observed several parallels with other contemporaneous MSA sites, particularly in the eastern part of southern Africa, the lithic assemblages at Sibudu demonstrate a distinct and so far unique combination of techno-typological traits. Our findings support the use of the Sibudan to help structuring this part of the southern African MSA and emphasize the need for further research to identify the spatial and temporal extent of this proposed cultural unit.

AB Freshwater food webs are dominated by aquatic invertebrates whose trophic relationships are often poorly known. Here, I used laboratory experiments to study the role of a water bug, Sigara striata, as a potential predator and prey in food webs of stagnant waters. Multiple-choice predation experiment revealed that Sigara, which had been considered mostly herbivorous, also consumed larvae of Chironomus midges. Because they often occur in high densities and are among the most ubiquitous aquatic insects, Sigara water bugs may be important predators in fresh waters. A second experiment tested the role of Sigara as a potential prey for 13 common invertebrate predators. Mortality of Sigara inflicted by different predators varied widely, especially depending on body mass, foraging mode (ambush/searching) and feeding mode (chewing/suctorial) of the predators. Sigara was highly vulnerable to ambush predators, while searching predators caused on average 8.1 times lower mortality of Sigara. Additionally, suctorial predators consumed on average 6.6 times more Sigara individuals than chewing predators, which supports previous results hinting on potentially different predation pressures of these two types of predators on prey populations. The importance of these two foraging-related traits demonstrates the need to move from body mass based to multiple trait based descriptions of food web structure. Overall, the results suggests that detailed experimental studies of common but insufficiently known species can significantly enhance our understanding of food web structure.

AB Background: Meat quality depends on skeletal muscle structure and metabolic properties. While most studies carried on pigs focus on the Longissimus muscle (LM) for fresh meat consumption, Semimembranosus (SM) is also of interest because of its importance for cooked ham production. Even if both muscles are classified as glycolytic muscles, they exhibit dissimilar myofiber composition and metabolic characteristics. The comparison of LM and SM transcriptome profiles undertaken in this study may thus clarify the biological events underlying their phenotypic differences which might influence several meat quality traits.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Muscular transcriptome analyses were performed using a custom pig muscle microarray: the 15 K Genmascqchip. A total of 3823 genes were differentially expressed between the two muscles (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P value <= 0.05), out of which 1690 and 2133 were overrepresented in LM and SM respectively. The microarray data were validated using the expression level of seven differentially expressed genes quantified by real-time RT-PCR. A set of 1047 differentially expressed genes with a muscle fold change ratio above 1.5 was used for functional characterization. Functional annotation emphasized five main clusters associated to transcriptome muscle differences. These five clusters were related to energy metabolism, cell cycle, gene expression, anatomical structure development and signal transduction/immune response.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study revealed strong transcriptome differences between LM and SM. These results suggest that skeletal muscle discrepancies might arise essentially from different post-natal myogenic activities.

AB The decomposition of dead organic matter is a major determinant of carbon and nutrient cycling in ecosystems, and of carbon fluxes between the biosphere and the atmosphere(1-3). Decomposition is driven by a vast diversity of organisms that are structured in complex food webs(2,4). Identifying the mechanisms underlying the effects of biodiversity on decomposition is critical(4-6) given the rapid loss of species worldwide and the effects of this loss on human well-being(7-9). Yet despite comprehensive syntheses of studies on how biodiversity affects litter decomposition(4-6,10), key questions remain, including when, where and how biodiversity has a role and whether general patterns and mechanisms occur across ecosystems and different functional types of organism(4,9-12). Here, in field experiments across five terrestrial and aquatic locations, ranging from the subarctic to the tropics, we show that reducing the functional diversity of decomposer organisms and plant litter types slowed the cycling of litter carbon and nitrogen. Moreover, we found evidence of nitrogen transfer from the litter of nitrogen-fixing plants to that of rapidly decomposing plants, but not between other plant functional types, highlighting that specific interactions in litter mixtures control carbon and nitrogen cycling during decomposition. The emergence of this general mechanism and the coherence of patterns across contrasting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems suggest that biodiversity loss has consistent consequences for litter decomposition and the cycling of major elements on broad spatial scales.

AB The patchy distribution of oligopeptide production abilities in cyanobacterial populations enables the classification of strains into different oligopeptide-based chemotypes. In order to evaluate the ecological significance of chemotypes in natural systems, we tracked the seasonal dynamics and sedimentation losses of Microcystis chemotypes in the eutrophic Valmayor reservoir (Spain). Fifty-three distinct chemotypes were identified throughout the season, six of them only present as benthic colonies. There was no correlation between chemotype affiliation and taxonomic morphospecies or colony size. The succession of chemotypes in the water column occurred synchronically in pelagic and littoral habitats and at different depths. Shifts in chemotype assemblages successfully explained temporal fluctuations in biomass-standardized microcystin contents of the bloom. The dynamics of chemotypes were driven both by asynchronous proliferation in the water column and significantly different sedimentation rates among chemotypes. While differential settling was the most important loss process shaping chemotype succession, the existence of alternative processes selectively inflicting massive losses to individual chemotypes was observed. Together, the significant differences in sedimentation and pelagic net growth rates among chemotypes, their segregation among pelagic and benthic habitats, as well as the existence of chemotype-selective loss processes, show that Microcystis oligopeptide chemotypes interact differently with their environment and represent commonly overlooked ecologically functional intraspecific linages.
