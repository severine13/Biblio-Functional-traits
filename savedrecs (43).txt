AB Quantitative tools based on mechanistic modelling of functional traits able to enhance the sustainability of aquaculture and most other human activities (i.e. reducing the likelihood of detrimental impacts optimising productions), are especially important factors in the decision to site aquaculture facilities in coastal lakes, ponds and lagoons and, in the case of detrimental impact, to adopt mitigation measures. We tested the ability of mechanistic functional trait based models to predict life history traits of cultivable shellfish in shallow coastal lakes. Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models were run to generate spatially explicit predictions of Mytilus galloprovincialis life history (LH) traits (e.g. body size and fecundity). Using fortnightly data of food supply and hourly data of body temperatures, and exploiting the power of mechanistic rules, we estimated the amount of faeces ejected by a fixed quantity of organisms cultivated in two shallow Southern Mediterranean (Sicily) lakes. These differed in terms of temperature and food density, implying large differences in life history traits of mussels in the two study areas. This information could help facilitate the selection of sites where environmental conditions are more suitable for aquaculture and contextually compatible with sustainability. The validation exercise obtained by comparing the predicted and observed data was nearly consistent. Therefore, a mechanistic functional traits-based model seems able to capture the link between habitat characteristics and functional traits of organisms, delineating the fundamental portion of an ecological niche, the possibility of predicting LH traits and potential ecological applications in the management of natural coastal resources.

AB Ecological restoration is set to play a key role in mitigating biodiversity loss. While many restorationists worry about what to do about and what to call rapidly changing ecosystems (no-analog, novel, or other terms), ecologists and managers in some parts of the world have avoided these controversies and proceeded with developing and implementing innovative restoration projects. We discuss examples from South Korea, including the Cheonggyecheon river project in Seoul and the new National Institute of Ecology, which combines scientific research, planted reference systems for future restoration, and an Ecorium for outreach and education. South Korea faces a range of restoration challenges, including managing even-aged planted forests, major land use changes (especially urbanization) affecting valuable tidal flats, and fragmented landscapes caused by intensive land use and the fenced Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The examples from South Korea provide insights that might guide future actions more broadly. These include flexible targets for restoration not based on historical precedents, considering ecosystem functions and functional trait diversity as well as species composition, creating model restoration projects, and managing adaptively.

AB Multivariate prey trait analysis is a functional approach to understand predator-prey relationships. Here, seven macroinvertebrate ecological traits have been used for the analysis of trophic ecology of co-occurring age classes of Northern Iberian chub Squalius carolitertii, a cyprinid fish species. The present study identified several key factors in the handling efficiency and habitat utilization for feeding of S. carolitertii that may have a wider application, particularly for other cyprinid species. The results revealed a remarkable similarity in the feeding behaviour among age classes, suggesting a foraging behaviour convergence among them in both prey-handling efficiency and feeding habitat utilization. Nevertheless, some age classes showed clear preferences for particular categories of ecological trait; for example, age 1 showed a clear ability to feed on flattened prey items, whereas ages 2 and 3 were able to feed on preys with different body shape due to their general distribution in the fuzzy principal component analysis (FPCA). Finally, this study shows how multivariate approaches can complement traditional diet analyses, and the method has wide applicability across life-stages of cyprinid species.

AB Functional trait composition of plant communities has been proposed as a helpful key for understanding the mechanisms of biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning. In this study, we applied a step-wise modeling procedure to test the relative effects of taxonomic diversity, functional identity, and functional diversity on macrophytes community productivity along water depth gradient. We sampled 42 plots and 1513 individual plants and measured 16 functional traits and abundance of 17 macrophyte species. Results showed that there was a significant decrease in taxonomic diversity, functional identity (i.e., stem dry mass content, leaf [C] and leaf [N]), and functional diversity (i.e., floating leaf, mean Julian flowering date and rooting depth) with increasing water depth. For the multiple-trait functional diversity (FD) indices, functional richness decreased, while functional divergence increased with water depth gradient. Macrophyte community productivity was strongly determined by functional trait composition within community, but not significantly affected by taxonomic diversity. Community-weighted means (CWM) showed a two times higher explanatory power relative to FD indices in determining variations in community productivity. For nine of sixteen traits, CWM and FD showed significant correlations with community productivity, although the strength and direction of those relations depended on selected trait. Furthermore, functional composition in a community affected productivity through either additive or opposite effects of CWM and FD, depending on the particular traits being considered. Our results suggested both mechanisms of mass ratio and niche complementarity can operate simultaneously on variations in community productivity, and considering both CWM and FD would lead to a more profound understanding of traits-productivity relationships.

AB Spatial subsidies are resources transferred from one ecosystem to another and which can greatly affect recipient systems. Increased subsidy quantity is known to increase these effects, but subsidy quality is likely also important. We examined the effects of leaf litter quality (varying in nutrient and tannin content) in pond mesocosms on gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) biomass export, as well as water quality and ecosystem processes. We used litter from three different tree species native to Missouri [white oak (Quercus alba), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum)], one non-native tree [white pine (Pinus strobus)], and a common aquatic grass [prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata)]. We found that leaf litter species affected almost every variable we measured. Gray treefrog biomass export was greatest in mesocosms with grass litter and lowest with white oak litter. Differences in biomass export were affected by high tannin concentrations (or possibly the correlated variable, dissolved oxygen) via their effects on survival, and by primary production, which altered mean body mass. Effects of litter species could often be traced back to the characteristics of the litter itself: leaf nitrogen, phosphorus, and tannin content, which highlights the importance of plant functional traits in affecting aquatic ecosystems. This work and others stress that changes in forest species composition could greatly influence aquatic systems and aquatic-terrestrial linkages.

AB Intraspecific diversity can have important effects on population, community and ecosystem processes, yet we have little understanding of the relative importance of genetic- versus trait-based measures of intraspecific diversity.
   I conducted a manipulative field experiment of plant (Spartina alterniflora) genotypic diversity and trait diversity to examine their independent and interactive effects on plant performance and community structure. I focused on variation within and among genotypes in plant stem height, a trait that varies substantially across environmental gradients and can be an important predictor of plant competition intensity.
   Trait and genotypic diversity interactively affected multiple metrics of plant performance. Both stem density and spatial spread increased with genotypic diversity in the low trait diversity combinations, yet there were negligible to weak negative effects in the high trait diversity treatments. Spartina alterniflora percentage cover also varied with genotypic and trait diversity, but not in a clear linear pattern.
   There were no effects of trait or genotypic diversity on associated macrofauna above-ground, yet they interactively affected below-ground measures. Infaunal abundance and sediment oxygen availability mirrored the idiosyncratic response of plant percentage cover.
   Despite the interactive effects of genotypic and trait diversity, high trait diversity consistently increased plant performance in genotypic monoculture.
   Synthesis. The effects of intraspecific plant trait diversity on a range of plant and community responses in this study reinforce the premise that functional differences underlie ecological effects of genetic diversity and suggest that readily measured trait variance may serve as a valuable predictor of plant performance.

AB Phenotypic plasticity is a common adaptation to environmental heterogeneity, and theory predicts that the evolution of constitutive versus plastic strategies should depend on the frequency of alternative environments, the magnitude of constraints and the costs of plasticity per se. However, it is unclear how species should evolve when they experience more than two environments that favour divergent phenotypes, particularly when they have absolute constraints on their morphology.
   We examined the plasticity of three freshwater snail species (Helisoma anceps, H.campanulata and H.trivolvis) in response to three environments: (i) no predator; (ii) shell-invading water bugs (Belostoma flumineum) and (iii) shell-crushing crayfish (Orconectes rusticus). We found distinct responses by each snail species to the predator treatments. Helisoma anceps starts with a relatively low, narrow and thick shell that becomes lower and thicker in response to crayfish but is unresponsive to water bugs. In contrast, H.campanulata starts with a relatively high, wide and thin shell that becomes lower and wider in response to water bugs but is unresponsive to crayfish. Helisoma trivolvis starts with a shell of intermediate height and width while the predators induce defences in different directions.
   These results suggest that H.trivolvis has a generalist plastic strategy while H.anceps and H.campanulata have specialised plastic strategies orientated against a single type of predator at the potential cost of being unable to respond to others.
   We then performed predation trials to determine predator preferences using a mixture of the three species. After 2weeks of exposure to crayfish cues, H.anceps had higher survival than both H.trivolvis and H.campanulata with uncaged crayfish. After 2weeks of exposure to water bug cues, both H.trivolvis and H.campanulata had higher survival than H.anceps with uncaged water bugs. When predation trials were conducted after 5weeks of exposure to predator cues, H.trivolvis and H.campanulata reached a size refuge from both predators and this shifted predation pressure to H.anceps.
   Collectively, these results suggest that closely related prey species with different absolute constraints in their morphology had different defences that are either specialised or generalised to alternative environments.

AB Large rivers are amongst the most degraded ecosystems. We studied a relationship between hydromorphological degradation and benthic invertebrates in large rivers in Slovenia. Five indices of the Slovenian hydromorphological assessment methodology were used to develop a HM stressor gradient. Natural type-specific habitat diversity was considered in the hydromorphological stressor gradient building and thus two hydromorphological types of large rivers were defined. CCA ordination with five HM indices and 315 benthic invertebrate taxa revealed variations in taxa response along the HM stressor gradient. First CCA axis species values were used to develop a taxon-specific river fauna value (Rf(i)), whereas tolerance values (biplot scaling) were used to determine a hydromorphological indicative weight (HWi). Rf(i), HWi, and log(5) abundance classes were combined using weighted average approach to construct a River fauna index for large rivers (RFIVR). Several additional benthic invertebrate-based metrics were also tested against the HQM. A Slovenian multimetric index for assessing the hydromorphological impact on benthic invertebrates in large rivers (SMEIHVR) was constructed from the RFIVR and a functional metric %akal + lithal + psammal taxa (scored taxa = 100%). The strong relationship between hydromorphological stressor gradient and SMEIHVR index provides us with an effective assessment system and river management tool.

AB Background: Ecological attributes estimated from food web models have the potential to be indicators of good environmental status given their capabilities to describe redundancy, food web changes, and sensitivity to fishing. They can be used as a baseline to show how they might be modified in the future with human impacts such as climate change, acidification, eutrophication, or overfishing.
   Methodology: In this study ecological network analysis indicators of 105 marine food web models were tested for variation with traits such as ecosystem type, latitude, ocean basin, depth, size, time period, and exploitation state, whilst also considering structural properties of the models such as number of linkages, number of living functional groups or total number of functional groups as covariate factors.
   Principal findings: Eight indicators were robust to model construction: relative ascendency; relative overhead; redundancy; total systems throughput (TST); primary production/TST; consumption/TST; export/TST; and total biomass of the community. Large-scale differences were seen in the ecosystems of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, with the Western Atlantic being more complex with an increased ability to mitigate impacts, while the Eastern Atlantic showed lower internal complexity. In addition, the Eastern Pacific was less organised than the Eastern Atlantic although both of these systems had increased primary production as eastern boundary current systems. Differences by ecosystem type highlighted coral reefs as having the largest energy flow and total biomass per unit of surface, while lagoons, estuaries, and bays had lower transfer efficiencies and higher recycling. These differences prevailed over time, although some traits changed with fishing intensity. Keystone groups were mainly higher trophic level species with mostly top-down effects, while structural/dominant groups were mainly lower trophic level groups (benthic primary producers such as seagrass and macroalgae, and invertebrates). Keystone groups were prevalent in estuarine or small/shallow systems, and in systems with reduced fishing pressure. Changes to the abundance of key functional groups might have significant implications for the functioning of ecosystems and should be avoided through management.
   Conclusion/significance: Our results provide additional understanding of patterns of structural and functional indicators in different ecosystems. Ecosystem traits such as type, size, depth, and location need to be accounted for when setting reference levels as these affect absolute values of ecological indicators. Therefore, establishing absolute reference values for ecosystem indicators may not be suitable to the ecosystem-based, precautionary approach. Reference levels for ecosystem indicators should be developed for individual ecosystems or ecosystems with the same typologies (similar location, ecosystem type, etc.) and not benchmarked against all other ecosystems.

AB Fire is nearly ubiquitous in the terrestrial biosphere, with profound effects on earth surface carbon storage, climate, and forest functions. Fuel quality is an important parameter determining forest fire behavior, which differs among both tree species and organs. Fuel quality is not static: when dead plant material decomposes, its structural, chemical, and water dynamic properties change, with implications for fuel flammability. However, the interactions between decomposition and flammability are poorly understood. This study aimed to determine decomposition's effects on fuel quality and how this directly and indirectly affects wood flammability. We did controlled experiments on water dynamics and fire using twigs of four temperate tree species. We found considerable direct and indirect effects of decomposition on twig flammability, particularly on ignitability and burning time, which are important variables for fire spread. More decomposed twigs ignite and burn faster at given water content. Moreover, decomposed twigs dry out faster than fresh twigs, which make them flammable sooner when drying out after rain. Decomposed fine woody litters may promote horizontal fire spread as ground fuels and act as a fuel ladder when staying attached to trees. Our results add an important, previously poorly studied dynamic to our understanding of forest fire spread.

AB Adaptations at the gamete level (a) evolve quickly, (b) appear sensitive to inbreeding and outbreeding and (c) have important influences on potential to reproduce. We apply this understanding to problems posed by escaped farm salmon and measure their potential to reproduce in the wild. Farm Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are a threat to biodiversity, because they escape in large numbers and can introgress, dilute or disrupt locally adapted wild gene pools. Experiments at the whole fish level have found farm reproductive potential to be significant, but inferior compared to wild adults, especially for males. Here, we assess reproductive performance at the gamete level through detailed in vitro comparisons of the form, function, fertility, compatibility and competitiveness of farm versus wild Atlantic salmon sperm and eggs, in conditions mimicking the natural gametic microenvironment, using fish raised under similar environmental conditions. Despite selective domestication and reduced genetic diversity, we find functional equivalence in all farm fish gamete traits compared with their wild ancestral strain. Our results identify a clear threat of farm salmon reproduction with wild fish and therefore encourage further consideration of using triploid farm strains with optimized traits for aquaculture and fish welfare, as triploid fish remain reproductively sterile following escape.

AB Biological trait analysis (BTA) is increasingly being employed to improve our understanding of the ecological functioning of marine benthic invertebrate communities. However, changes in trait composition are seldomly compared with concomitant changes in metrics of ecological function. Consequently, inferences regarding the functional implications of any changes are often anecdotal; we currently have a limited understanding of the functional significance of the traits commonly used. In this study, we quantify the relationship between benthic invertebrate trait composition and secondary production estimates using data spanning almost the breadth of the UK continental shelf.
   Communities described by their composition of 10 traits representing life history, morphology and behaviour showed strong relationships with variations in total secondary production. A much weaker relationship was observed for community productivity (or P:B), a measure of rate of energy turnover. Furthermore, the relationship between total production and multivariate taxonomic community composition was far weaker than that for trait composition. Indeed, the similarities between communities as defined by taxonomy were very different from those depicted by their trait composition. That is, as many studies have demonstrated, taxonomically different communities may display similar trait compositions, and vice versa. Finally, we found that descriptions of community trait composition vary greatly depending on whether abundance or biomass is used as the enumeration weighting method during BTA, and trait assessments based on biomass produced better relations with secondary production than those based on abundance. We discuss the significance of these findings with respect to BTA using marine benthic invertebrates. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Invasive species may impact biotic community structure, ecosystem processes, and associated goods and services. Their impact may be especially strong when they also serve as ecosystem engineers (i.e. organisms affecting the physical habitat and resources for other species). Dreissenid mussels fill both these roles, having invaded the Laurentian Great Lakes in the late 1980s, and also serve as ecosystem engineers by altering nutrient fluxes and influencing the microbial food web through direct nutrient release and excretion of feces and pseudo-feces at the water-sediment interface. We conducted laboratory experiments to investigate how the different functional traits of invasive quagga mussels (filtering activity and direct nutrient release) and native chironomid larvae (tube building and bioirrigation) interact with lake sediment of differing organic matter content to influence biogeochemical fluxes and water quality. Our results showed that sediment reworking and ventilation activities by chironomid larvae increased oxygen penetration in the sediment, affecting primarily pore water chemistry, whereas invasive mussels enhanced nutrient releases in the surface water. However, sediment organic matter modulated the effects of ecosystem engineers on system-level processes; chironomids had a greater influence on sediment reworking and microbial-mediated processes in organic-rich sediments, whereas quagga mussels enhanced nutrient concentrations in the overlying water of organic-poor sediments. These results have management implications, as the effects of invasive mussels on the biogeochemical functioning in the Great Lakes region and elsewhere can alter system bioenergetics and promote harmful algal blooms.

AB Ecological studies on phenotypic plasticity illustrate the relevance of this phenomenon in nature. Conditions of biota reflect environmental changes, highlighting the adaptability of resident species that can be used as bioindicators of such changes. We report the morpho-anatomical plasticity of leaves of Avicennia schaueriana Stapf & Leechm. ex Moldenke, Laguncularia racemosa (L) C.F.Gaertn. and Rhizophora mangle L, evaluated in three estuaries (Vitoria bay, Santa Cruz and Itaunas River; state of Espirito Santo, Brazil), considering five areas of mangrove ecosystems with diverse environmental issues. Two sampling sites are part of the Ecological Station Lameirao Island in Vitoria bay, close to a harbor. A third sampling site in Cariacica (Vitoria bay) is inside the Vitoria harbor and also is influenced by domestic sewage. The fourth studied area (Santa Cruz) is part of Piraque Mangrove Ecological Reservation, while the fifth (Itaunas River) is a small mangrove, with sandy sediment and greater photosynthetically active radiation, also not strongly influenced by anthropic activity. Results pointed out the morpho-anatomical plasticity in studied species, showing that A. schaueriana and L. racemosa might be considered the most appropriate bioindicators to indicate different settings and environmental conditions. Particularly, the dry mass per leaf area (LMA) of A. schaueriana was the main biomarker measured. In our study, LMA of A. schaueriana was positively correlated with salinity (Spearman 0.71), Mn content (0.81) and pH (0.82) but negatively correlated with phosphorus content (-0.63). Thus, the evaluation of modification in LMA of A. schaueriana pointed out changes among five studied sites, suggesting its use to reflect changes in the environment, which could be also useful in the future to evaluate the climate change.

AB Rivers and streams affected by mining activities often receive short-term sharp salinity increases due to watersoluble stockpiled materials being washed into receiving water bodies. We conducted a mesocosm study to explore the response of structural (diatom and stream invertebrate communities) and functional descriptors (chlorophyll a concentration, fungal biomass and leaf decomposition) to repeated short salinity pulses (3 h of duration, with nominal electrical conductivities of 5, 10 and 15 mS cm(-1)), mimicking the exposure pattern occurring at salt-mine affected rivers. The experiment was conducted in 12 artificial flow-through stream systems over 16 days. The effect of the salt pulses on the ecosystem structure and functioning did not fully match most of our initial hypotheses, with the community response being weaker than predicted. The diatom community was, however, dominated by salt-tolerant species throughout the experiment, showing no consistent response to the treatment. The invertebrate response was associated with statistically significant changes in community structure (i.e. abundance of the different taxa) but no statistically significant changes in taxa richness. The salt pulses affected some functional descriptors of the ecosystem: fungal biomass exhibited a unimodal response to treatment magnitude, algal growth (i.e. chl a biomass) was hampered with increasing conductivity and leaf decomposition was significantly reduced in the high treatment.

AB Trawling is known to disturb benthic communities and habitats, which may in turn indirectly affect populations of commercial species that live in close association with the seabed. The degree of impact on both benthic communities and demersal species depends on the fishing effort level. This may vary over the year because of the fleet dynamics, which are in turn normally driven by the main target species' life cycle. In this study we describe changes in benthic functional components of a northwestern Mediterranean fishing ground that represents a recruitment area for an important target species (red mullet, Mullus barbatus). This fishing ground experiences a varying intensity of fishing effort over the year and benthic functional components under different levels of trawling were compared with an unfished, control area. Traits related to sexual maturity and life span for infauna and body size and life span for epifauna were found to vary with fishing activity. Potential effects of these changes on ecological functioning and the impact on red mullet population are discussed. The development of fisheries management plans under an ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM) requires the links between target species and benthic communities' disturbance due to fishing practices to be explicitly considered.

AB Behavioural responses to changing environments affect community composition, so the identification of associations between environmental gradients, behavioural traits and physiological traits makes a significant contribution to the quest for trait-based rules of community change.
   We tested the hypothesis that fish morphology and lifestyle are associated with metabolic rate, hence oxygen demand, and behavioural response to gradual hypoxia [low dissolved oxygen (DO)], using respirometry and behavioural experiments. Three species fell along different points of the fast-slow lifestyle continuum: Melanotaenia fluviatilis, a pelagic fish adapted to endurance swimming, lies at the fast end of the lifestyle continuum, while Mogurnda adspersa, a benthic fish adapted to burst swimming, lies at the other end. The benthopelagic Hypseleotris sp. has an intermediate lifestyle.
   Standard and routine metabolic rates varied strongly among the species and were associated with lifestyle according to the inequality M.fluviatilis>Hypseleotris>M.adspersa. As DO declined, aquatic surface respiration behaviour also varied significantly among the species and indicated a sensitivity to hypoxia described by the same inequality. As hypoxia ensued, changes in habitat were also linked to lifestyle, but changes in activity level among species were not neatly correlated with lifestyle.
   Overall, our experiments imply that there are significant links between morphology, lifestyle, metabolism and behavioural response to hypoxia in these three species of fish.

AB Plant species composition is changing across many landscapes, but it is unclear how these changes affect habitat quality for animals. We used functional diversity and community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values for four plant traits (litter N, P, lignin and soluble phenolics) to explore how changes in plant species composition may affect larval amphibians in a simplified aquatic ecosystem. We predicted that increased functional diversity would improve amphibian performance (survivorship, developmental rate, and size). We also predicted that increases in CWM N and P would improve amphibian performance, while increases in CWM lignin and soluble phenolics would have negative effects on amphibian performance. We did not detect an effect of functional diversity; instead, CWM litter N and soluble phenolics were useful predictors of amphibian performance. We demonstrate that quantifying the CWM of ecologically relevant traits represents a powerful approach for predicting how changes in plant species composition can affect aquatic communities.

AB Two unconnected time-integrated tracers of niche use provided similar conclusions about individual foraging behaviour and niche adaptations (functional traits in head shape) within a subarctic lake population of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). Zooplanktivorous individuals mainly from the pelagic zone were characterised by having low delta C-13 values, high infections of the parasites transmitted by pelagic copepods (especially Diphyllobothrium spp.) and slender heads with long snouts. In contrast, fish individuals that had consumed benthic prey in the littoral zone were enriched in delta C-13 and had high abundances of parasites transmitted by Gammarus lacustris (Cyathocephalus truncatus and Cystidicola farionis) and a robust head shape. There were strong positive correlations between individual delta C-13 values and the abundance of the two parasite species transmitted by Gammarus, but a negative correlation between delta C-13 and the infection of copepod-borne parasites. The close relationships between diet variation (foraging behaviour), the time-integrated ecological tracers (SI and parasites) and functional trophic morphology (niche adaptations) evidently reflect long-term temporally stable niche use of each individual predator. The two independent time-integrated tracers both gave valuable information of specialised trophic behaviour at the individual level, which is an important basis for studies related to ecological (e.g., resource partitioning) and evolutionary (e.g., polymorphism) topics within a population.

AB The global biodiversity crisis has invigorated the search for generalized patterns in most disciplines within the natural sciences. Studies based on organismal functional traits attempt to broaden implications of results by identifying the response of functional traits, instead of taxonomic units, to environmental variables. Determining the functional trait responses enables more direct comparisons with, or predictions for, communities of different taxonomic composition. The North American freshwater fish fauna is both diverse and increasingly imperiled through human mediated disturbances, including climate change. The Tennessee River, USA, contains one of the most diverse assemblages of freshwater fish in North America and has more imperiled species than other rivers, but there has been no trait-based study of community structure in the system. We identified 211 localities in the upper Tennessee River that were sampled by the Tennessee Valley Authority between 2009 and 2011 and compiled fish functional traits for the observed species and environmental variables for each locality. Using fourth corner analysis, we identified significant correlations between many fish functional traits and environmental variables. Functional traits associated with an opportunistic life history strategy were correlated with localities subject to greater land use disturbance and less flow regulation, while functional traits associated with a periodic life history strategy were correlated with localities subject to regular disturbance and regulated flow. These are patterns observed at the continental scale, highlighting the generalizability of trait-based methods. Contrary to studies that found no community structure differences when considering riparian buffer zones, we found that fish functional traits were correlated with different environmental variables between analyses with buffer zones vs. entire catchment area land cover proportions. Using existing databases and fourth corner analysis, our results support the broad application potential for trait-based methods and indicate trait-based methods can detect environmental filtering by riparian zone land cover.

AB Understanding of relationships between morphology and ecological performance can help to reveal how natural selection drives biological diversification. We investigate relationships between feeding behavior, foraging performance and morphology within a diverse group of teleost fishes, and examine the extent to which associations can be explained by evolutionary relatedness. Morphological adaptation associated with sediment sifting was examined using a phylogenetic linear discriminant analysis on a set of ecomorphological traits from 27 species of Neotropical cichlids. For most sifting taxa, feeding behavior could be effectively predicted by a linear discriminant function of ecomorphology across multiple clades of sediment sifters, and this pattern could not be explained by shared evolutionary history alone. Additionally, we tested foraging efficiency in seven Neotropical cichlid species, five of which are specialized benthic feeders with differing head morphology. Efficiency was evaluated based on the degree to which invertebrate prey could be retrieved at different depths of sediment. Feeding performance was compared both with respect to feeding mode and species using a phylogenetic ANCOVA, with substrate depth as a covariate. Benthic foraging performance was constant across sediment depths in non-sifters but declined with depth in sifters. The non-sifting Hypsophrys used sweeping motions of the body and fins to excavate large pits to uncover prey; this tactic was more efficient for consuming deeply buried invertebrates than observed among sediment sifters. Findings indicate that similar feeding performance among sediment-sifting cichlids extracting invertebrate prey from shallow sediment layers reflects constraints associated with functional morphology and, to a lesser extent, phylogeny.

AB Regional and local processes are thought to influence community phylogenetic and species diversity, but have proved challenging to distinguish. We disentangled the effects of local (limiting similarity and habitat filtering) and regional processes (biogeography, history and geographical constraints) on the species and phylogenetic diversity of native riverine fish communities across France. Fish species richness (SR), phylogenetic diversity (estimated as the phylogenetic species variability metric, PSV) and trait evenness (estimated from 17 ecological and life-history traits) were estimated for fish at 932 sampling sites across 42 river basins in France. A phylogenetic signal in traits and species responses to environment variation were estimated using linear models. Null models were developed to test whether river basins constrain the PSV of the communities. Hierarchical linear models were fitted to PSV and SR to partition the variance explained by local and regional processes. Fish species richness and phylogenetic diversity were negatively correlated across sites (r=-0.589, P<0 001). There was a phylogenetic signal in species traits, but only a weak signal in species responses to environmental variation across sites. The null models suggested that river basins constrain community PSV. Local-scale predictors (temperature, landscape position and trait evenness) explained the variation in both PSV and SR, while regional-scale predictors (latitude, longitude and basin surface area) explained the variation only in SR. Significant interaction terms between local- and regional-scale predictors were also detected for both metrics. Local-scale processes, habitat filtering and limiting similarity, probably determine the species composition of fish communities across France, while broad-scale, regional processes constrain community composition both directly and indirectly by affecting the strength of these local-scale processes. By analysing phylogenetic diversity and species richness simultaneously, a full picture of the drivers of local-scale diversity can be determined.

AB Traits-based analyses of insect assemblages support biomonitoring programme objectives. To date, however, few traits-based metrics have demonstrated the degree of sensitivity or discriminatory power required by biomonitoring programmes. Trait information used for analyses is typically based on static descriptions of dynamic communities and is attributed only to taxonomic units. Given that traits can vary even among specimens from the same species, quantifying trait variation and its consequences could be essential for successful traits-based biomonitoring. Here, we study the consequences of measuring trait expression among individual specimens versus assigning trait states from published databases at the taxon level (genus or family) for the interpretation of trait patterns within aquatic insect assemblages. Specifically, do database body size trait states accurately reflect measured body size values of aquatic insects collected in biomonitoring samples and should body size data be aggregated at the taxon level or assessed at the specimen level to detect differences among sites? We assessed body size, a continuous trait linked to fundamental organism properties and ecological function, for four orders of aquatic insects: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata. Invertebrate samples were collected from the Miramichi River basin (New Brunswick, Canada) according to the Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network method. Concordance between measured specimen sizes and published trait states was poor; 55% of taxa expressed body sizes considerably smaller or larger than assigned database states. Recalibration of size classes based on specimen measurements yielded three size classes that facilitated detection of assemblage-aggregated size differences among reference sites. Measured body size trait values were able to distinguish these differences in community structure, while values derived from databases yielded erroneous patterns in the size structure among sites. Gaining accurate ecological insights from traits-based biomonitoring may require assessing trait properties at the scale of individual specimens. The benefits of this approach, however, should be balanced against additional effort required in the context of specific study or programme objectives.

AB Seasonal droughts are predictable components of arid-land stream hydrology, and many arid-land aquatic taxa have adapted to their extreme environment. However, climate change is altering this predictable hydrology, producing longer and more severe droughts and creating novel disturbance regimes for resident organisms. The hydrologic transitions from flowing stream to fragmented pools to dry stream bed are frequently associated with steep decreases in taxonomic and functional diversity, referred to as thresholds of biodiversity loss. Less is known about how taxa respond between these thresholds, as fragmented pools gradually dry and abiotic conditions intensify. While an increasingly extreme environment may be expected to reduce taxonomic and trait richness, species adapted to predictable seasonal fragmentation may be resistant to declining water levels until all surface water is lost. We used aquatic mesocosms to test two competing hypotheses of the relationship between richness and pool drying for arid-land stream invertebrates: (i) the drought vulnerability hypothesis (richness gradually decreases with drying) and (ii) the drought resistance hypothesis (richness remains constant until complete drying occurs). We inoculated replicate mesocosms with aquatic invertebrates from arid-land streams in Arizona, U.S.A., and applied three drying treatments representing a continuum of drying stress commonly observed in local streams during the summer dry season (water depths: 10, 7 and 1cm). Mesocosms were covered to restrict dispersal and colonisation processes and to isolate resistance (in situ survival of species) from resilience (community recovery following disturbance). After 45days, we destructively sampled all invertebrates in the mesocosms and calculated various taxonomic and functional trait metrics. Taxonomic richness and composition did not differ between drying treatments, providing strong support for the drought resistance hypothesis. Severe drying was associated with lower invertebrate abundances and higher densities than the moderate and control treatments. This finding suggests that density-dependent processes generated by decreased available habitat may be more important determinants of community composition during droughts than abiotic stress in this system. We observed a near-complete overlap of trophic traits (body size and functional feeding group) and resistance traits (respiration mode and diapause) among the three treatments. This high functional redundancy may provide a buffer against changes to ecosystem functioning, even in cases of severe-drying-induced habitat contraction and fragmentation.

AB Functional homogenisation of ecological communities (i.e. communities composed mainly of generalist species) is a major concern and has been often considered as a non-random effect of anthropogenic stress, with generalist taxa being preferentially selected under increasing stress.
   However, the degree of specialisation of a given taxon for a particular resource (a convenient proxy for studying functional homogenisation) is often described simply as uses the resource' or does not', despite there being an obvious continuum of degrees of specialisation by species for many different resources. Moreover, the non-randomness of the relationship between resource specialisation by the species making up a community and anthropogenic stress has been rarely tested.
   In this study, a framework based on fuzzy-coded traits is proposed to calculate a new continuous index of potential specialisation for a variety of taxa in a wide range of ecosystems. The use of this index is illustrated using 10 Eltonian and 11 Grinnellian traits of stream macroinvertebrate assemblages. We tested (i) the significance of the relationships between the average degree of specialisation among the taxa of a community and two types of anthropogenic stress (acidification and organic contamination) at the local scale and (ii) the non-randomness of these relationships.
   Stress gradients explained, through non-random effects, a rather high proportion of the variability observed in the degree of taxon specialisation, with significant relationships for eight of the 21 traits studied with regard to acidification and for 18 of the 21 traits with regard to organic contamination. Although most of these relationships described functional homogenisation (i.e. decreasing specialisation with increasing stress), increasing specialisation with increasing stress was demonstrated for a few Eltonian traits.
   We confirmed the importance of indicators of functional homogenisation calculated at the community level when studying the loss of biodiversity due to anthropogenic stress. The assessment of ecological specialisation seems to be a very promising strategy for understanding the effects of habitat impairment on community and ecosystem processes. Moreover, we show that the intensity of functional homogenisation depends on a trade-off between direct' and indirect' effects of stressors, and we consider that more attention should be paid to the mechanisms by which anthropogenic stressors act on taxa.

AB Despite a general recognition that benthic macroinvertebrates respond to changes in hydrological connectivity within floodplain ecosystems, no consensus about patterns in community structure and ecosystem processes across large scales and different climates has yet been established. Such knowledge is necessary since anthropogenic activities continue to alter the natural hydrogeomorphology of large floodplains, with most consequences for aquatic communities remaining unknown. Using information from six large rivers located in four different climate regions (humid subtropical, maritime temperate, Mediterranean and dry semi-arid), we compared benthic macroinvertebrate responses along lateral gradients of hydrological connectivity. We tested hypotheses related to differences among climate regions and to similar hydrological constraints within any one climate. The large geographical scale covered by this study provides the first comprehensive comparison of aquatic community patterns across hydrological gradients under different climatic settings. Multivariate ordinations demonstrated a higher overlap of trait community composition (50% variance explained by the first two axes) than taxonomic composition (15%) among floodplains, displaying high interclimate trait stability. The taxonomy-based ordination separated the subtropical floodplain, with an average 86% of non-insect taxa, from the insect-dominated temperate, Mediterranean and semi-arid floodplains (with >50% insect abundance). In the trait-based ordination, large body size (60% of organisms >4cm) and long lifespan duration (80% of organisms) discriminated the subtropical from the other five studied floodplains. Across a gradient of lateral connectivity, linear mixed effect (LME) models supported seven of 15 hypotheses, which suggests remarkably consistent macroinvertebrate patterns in floodplains regardless of the climate regime. Taxon and trait richness were positively related and peaked at sites of intermediate hydrological connectivity. Our predictions about the feeding guilds of macroinvertebrates (e.g. that shredders and scrapers would be more abundant in connected channels, and predators and deposit feeders at isolated sites) were more strongly supported by the data than those about life history (e.g. plurivoltinism and short lifespan would be better represented in connected channels). This difference was related to the influence of extended periods of hydrological disconnection as disturbance in addition to flooding. Trait stability across hydrological connectivity provides a meaningful ecological context for the comparison of the macroinvertebrate benthos among climatic zones, where taxonomic composition differs strongly. In addition, trait similarities and dissimilarities found in this study suggest that large-scale biogeographical filters do operate on communities, resulting in different trait combinations in temperate and Mediterranean floodplains when compared to semi-arid and subtropical environments. The extent to which global macroecological factors (i.e. climate, dispersal history) and local biotic and abiotic factors (i.e. drought frequency, habitat structure, water chemistry) contribute to this difference requires further investigation.

AB Leaf litter in streams is exploited by benthic macroinvertebrates, and leaf traits may influence colonisation by this group. This study aimed to compare the leaf decomposition rates, structure, and composition of the macroinvertebrate fauna colonising the litter of plant species with contrasting leaf traits. Litter bags from two native plant species (Sebastiania brasiliensis and Campomanesia xanthocarpa) and two non-natives (Hovenia dulcis and Platanus x acerifolia) were incubated in a subtropical stream. After 7, 14, 21, and 28 days, four leaf bags for each species were removed, and the leaf decomposition rates, density of organisms and trophic guilds, taxonomic richness, and functional composition of the macroinvertebrates were compared. The decomposition rates and densities of organisms, shredders, and collector-gatherers were higher for the leaves considered to be better quality, with lower C:N and Lignin:N ratios (from S. brasiliensis and H. dulcis). Additionally, the taxonomic and functional compositions of the macroinvertebrates were different for these leaves. In contrast, the species richness and density of the other guilds showed no significant difference between species. This study shows that detritivorous groups prefer leaves of better quality, and most results may be influenced by the high nutritional content and low amount of compounds that complicate fragmentation, such as tannins, lignin, and cellulose. Therefore, the effects of the replacement of riparian plant species on the local macrofauna depend of the traits of the introduced and replaced plant, regardless of their origin.

AB Common reed (Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.) is distributed widely throughout the world with various ecotypes. This research compares the functional traits and biomass allocation patterns of two contrasting reed ecotypes. Twelve pairs of aquatic and terrestrial reed samples were collected in northern China. Significant differences in functional traits between the two reed ecotypes were observed, while biomass allocation patterns of reed organs did not differ significantly except for at the root. The dry matter content (DMC) in the whole of the reed plant, leaf, root, and rhizome was higher; while the specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length (SRL) were lower in terrestrial versus aquatic reed. The biomass allocation in organs of the two forms of reed was isometric, only root in the terrestrial habitat increased faster with an increase in the whole plant biomass. It can be affirmed that aquatic and terrestrial reed that adapt to different environments generally has distinct leaf and root functional traits but isometric biomass allocation patterns. This suggests different resource acquisition strategies: (1) aquatic reed grows faster with high SLA and SRL and is more responsive to the environment, while (2) terrestrial reed with high DMC grows slower and is less responsive to the adverse environment (e.g. dry soil conditions).

AB Although the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system exports large amounts of nutrients to the Northern Gulf of Mexico annually, nutrient limitation of primary productivity still occurs offshore, acting as one of the major factors controlling local phytoplankton biomass and community structure. Bioassays were conducted for 48 hrs at two stations adjacent to the river plumes in April and August 2012. High Performance of Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) combined with ChemTax and a Fluorescence Induction and Relaxation (FIRe) system were combined to observe changes in the phytoplankton community structure and photosynthetic activity. Major fluorescence parameters (F-o, F-v/F-m) performed well to reveal the stimulating effect of the treatments with nitrogen (N-nitrate) and with nitrogen plus phosphate (+NPi). HPLC/ChemTax results showed that phytoplankton community structure shifted with nitrate addition: we observed an increase in the proportion of diatoms and prasinophytes and a decrease in cyanobacteria and prymnesiophytes. These findings are consistent with predictions from trait-based analysis which predict that phytoplankton groups with high maximum growth rates (mu(max)) and high nutrient uptake rates (V-max) readily take advantage of the addition of limiting nutrients. Changes in phytoplankton community structure, if persistent, could trigger changes of particular organic matter fluxes and alter the micro-food web cycles and bottom oxygen consumption.

AB We propose that a niche-based experimental approach at population level could be used to solve some uncertainties in traditional approaches in ecotoxicology. We tested this approach in the context of multiple stressors (i.e. chemical and physical) in a selection of six run-of-river reservoirs with different levels of sediment contamination and associated upstream and downstream river sites. A niche-based approach was tested using three functional traits (habitat, food preferences and body size) and discrepancy between the realized and theoretical niches. We first identified three groups of taxa and then recorded differences along the disturbance gradients, such as an increase in competition, a narrowing of spatial and trophic niche breadth (e.g. of Leuctra major and Gammarus pulex), a widening of spatial niche breadth (e.g. of Ephemerella ignita), a greater proportion of small individuals (e.g. of G. pulex) and a decreasing or an increasing (e.g. L. major) discrepancy between realized and theoretical niches.

AB Benthic macroinvertebrates and wild fish aggregating in the vicinity of four Mediterranean fish farms were sampled. Concentrations of metals and other elements were measured in macrofaunal taxa and in fish tissues (muscle, liver, gills, bone, gonad, stomach, intestine, and stomach content). Biological and geochemical characteristics play an important role in metal accumulation in benthic invertebrates, and consequently in metal transfer to higher trophic levels. Macroinvertebrates accumulated lower concentrations of most metals and elements than their respective sediment, except As, P, Na, Zn and Cd. Elemental concentrations of benthic organisms increased with increasing sediment metal content, except Cd, and with % silt, refractory organic matter and chlorophyll-a of sediment due to the influence of sediment geochemistry on metal bioavailability. Tolerant species were found to accumulate higher concentrations of most metals and elements, except for Cd, than equilibrium species. The ecological and morphological characteristics of the benthic invertebrates can affect the bioaccumulation of metals and elements in macrobenthos. Hg and P were found to increase their concentrations from zoobenthos to wild fish aggregating around fish cages feeding on macrofauna. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The taxonomic and functional structure of the subtidal nematode assemblages from a temperate estuary (Mondego estuary, Portugal) was studied, focussing on different taxonomic levels (genus, family and order), on single functional groups and on multiple biological traits. Based on taxonomic levels and on four biological traits (feeding type, life strategy, tail and body shape), the analysis of the nematode assemblage distribution patterns revealed spatial differences but no clear temporal pattern. At the family and genus level, a separation of the upstream sections was observed, while a distinction of polyhaline and euhaline areas was less evident. The use of biological traits added new information regarding the relationships between diversity patterns and the environmental variables. Most nematodes encountered along the estuary were non-selective deposit feeders (1B) and omnivores/predators (2B), colonizer-persisters (score of 2 or 3), with clavate-conicocylindrical tails and slender bodies and with a distribution related essentially to salinity, oxygen and chlorophyll a. Applying a Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) showed the role of oxygen concentration in the distribution of the nematode communities. Although the BTA was no more powerful than the traditional taxonomic approach in detecting spatial differences along the Mondego estuary, it has increased our knowledge of the functional structure and characterization of nematode communities in the estuary.

AB Community assembly is affected by environmental filtering that restricts viable phenotypes and by species interactions that impose limits on interspecific trait similarity. Relative influences of these processes should vary according to habitat features and dispersal. Species dispersion within assemblage trait space also should vary in relation to species richness, strength of competition, and the spatiotemporal scale of analysis. We examined ecomorphological diversity of two freshwater fish families (Neotropical Cichlidae, Nearctic Centrarchidae) to test theories of local assembly from regional species pools and theories of species packing within mesohabitat patches. Cichlid and centrarchid assemblages were surveyed in four floodplain rivers (two in South America and two in North America) during low-water periods when fish densities are highest. Surveys were conducted in four mesohabitat types (submerged wood, leaf litter, rocks, sand bank) within river channels and floodplain lakes. We measured 23 morphological traits associated with locomotion and feeding. Principal components analysis was performed on the species x traits matrix, and species axis scores were used to calculate species pairwise Euclidean distances and indices of dispersion within assemblage morphospace: mean nearest-neighbor distance (indicating similarity), mean distance to centroid (assemblage morphospace size), and standard deviation of nearest-neighbor distance (evenness of dispersion within assemblage morphospace). A null model was used to assess whether patterns were significantly nonrandom. When data for all mesohabitat types were combined for each river, species were significantly overdispersed and the assemblage morphospace was larger than predicted at random in every case. Analysis of assemblages within mesohabitat patches of different types revealed, in every case, significant overdispersion of species in morphospace indicative of limiting similarity. The total assemblage morphospace was greater than expected for tropical cichlids, but not for temperate centrarchids. Trends of species dispersion with assemblage morphospace in relation to species richness within mesohabitat patches were not consistent among or within river systems, possibly indicating that patches were already saturated with these perciform fishes. Interregional comparisons suggest an influence from both adaptive diversification and environmental filtering at broad spatial scales. At the scale of mesohabitat patches in lowland rivers, cichlid and centrarchid assemblages revealed patterns of trait complementarity that imply limiting similarity and strong influence of biotic interactions.

The present study examines relationships between the presence and density of dams and biological metrics of river health in the context of a variety of environmental drivers over the Loire river basin. We hypothesized that dam density measured at supra-reach level would show more significant influence on river health than the local level density, and further that the impact of dams is best estimated with measures for the functional traits of biotic assemblages. An extensive dataset of fish (169 sites) and invertebrate (211 sites) communities in the Loire river basin, described with metrics of density of ecological guilds, taxonomic richness and life history traits, and coupled with reach hydromorphology and catchment characteristics was constructed. Generalized linear modeling was performed in order to quantify dam impact and investigate the importance of regional- and local-scale measures of dam density to the structure of biotic communities. The analysis showed that community structure at the basin scale responded significant to dam presence and confirmed that the strongest relationships were observed for specific functional trait-based metrics. For the macroinvertebrates the observed impact counts up to 25% of the variance in the trait-based quality indices, whereas for fish communities the dam density only explains up to 12%. Macroinvertebrate responses were stronger at higher scale level, and especially the upstream context explained on its own 70% of the observed impairment. For fish communities, the local context prevails and explained up to 70% of the dam impact. These results can be explained by the biotic processes ruling community assembly in the specific groups, passive dispersal for the invertebrates and migrations between habitats for fish. The geographic context furthermore explains the differentiation in these responses, reflecting the metacommunity structure of invertebrate assembly over the river basin. We conclude that for upstream parts of the river basin, locally based management actions can be successful in restoring biotic integrity, whereas more downstream, dam removal actions require more integrated measures at regional rather than local scale.

AB Marine ecosystems are typically under the influence of multiple Human activities, which hinders the assessment of the effects of a specific activity upon their biological assemblages. In this context, distance-based linear models were used to analyse the relationships of several structural and functional metrics of both macroinvertebrates and fish assemblages with the specific types of pressure (i.e. fishing, organic, physical and non-point-source) as well as the global pattern of cumulative pressures. Both indicators detected similarly the effects of the global degradation and the analyses of the metrics' sensitivity (given the expected response trends) suggested that the non-point-source had the strongest contribution to this pattern, followed by organic pollution. The difficulties of assessing single pressure effects in a multiple pressures context are discussed. An approach based on the previous identification of pressure sources, a sampling strategy directed to those sources, together with indicator response is highly recommended, as it could be the only way to accurately predict human-induced changes on broad range ecosystems, with likely implications in the success of marine management plans.

AB 1. Lotic ecosystems worldwide are being increasingly modified hydromorphologically, for example, by damming, fragmentation, flow regulation and channel modification. Serious threats to riverine biodiversity are suspected, yet available field data are few and rarely address the various taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic components of biodiversity.
   2. We examined benthic macroinvertebrate diversity along a gradient of hydromorphological alteration across 65 lowland river sites in the Netherlands, Germany and Poland. We calculated eight metrics describing taxonomic diversity (richness, rarefied richness, Shannon's and Simpson's diversity, Pielou's evenness), functional diversity (mean trait diversity) and phylogenetic diversity (mean taxonomic distinctness and its variance).
   3. Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) and Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) showed detailed changes in taxonomic and trait composition, respectively, with increasing hydromorphological alteration. TITAN revealed a gradual turnover under increasing impact in which taxon losses were almost balanced by gains. NMS illustrated a high degree of concordance in the traits possessed by the taxa lost and gained at the gradient's end points.
   4. Although a biologically meaningful hydromorphological gradient was evident, the biodiversity response was modest (Spearman's <|0.32| for all metrics). Pielou's evenness and mean taxonomic distinctness actually increased at impaired sites.
   5. Our results suggest that taxonomic and trait replacement with hydromorphological alteration is not followed by changes in whole-community diversity. This implies some redundancy in these systems, with ecologically similar species replacing those lost through environmental change.
   6. The results highlight how whole-community-based diversity, although frequently calculated and interpreted for decades in ecology and conservation biology, is not the all-purpose concept to detect and assess the various facets of biodiversity loss. Therefore, we suggest that concerted effort is needed to develop and test novel indicators of biodiversity, capable of detecting biodiversity loss, or other changes, in response to the main environmental stressors of lotic ecosystems.

AB 1. The ability to predict the likely ecological impacts of invasive species in fresh waters is a pressing research requirement. Whilst comparisons of species traits and considerations of invasion history have some efficacy in this respect, we require robust methods that can compare the effects of native and invasive species. Here, we utilise comparative functional responses and prey selectivity experiments to understand and predict the ecological impact of an invader as compared to a native.
   2. We compared the predatory functional responses of an emerging invasive species in Europe, the killer shrimp', Dikerogammarus villosus, and an analogous native species, Gammarus pulex, towards three representative prey species: Asellus aquaticus, Daphnia magna and Chironomus sp. Furthermore, as ecological impact may be greater for invasive species with more indiscriminate feeding habits, we compared the selectivity for the three prey types between the invasive and native species.
   3. In both the presence and absence of experimental habitats, large D.villosus, and those matched for body size with G.pulex, generally showed higher (Type II) functional responses than G.pulex, with the invasive species exhibiting higher maximum feeding rates. Further, D.villosus exhibited significantly more indiscriminate prey selection compared with G.pulex, a trait that became more evident as the invader increased in size. Differences in functional responses and prey selectivity were prey species specific, with higher to lower predicted impacts in the order A.aquaticus, D.magna and Chironomus sp. This is in accord with the impact of this invasive species on macroinvertebrates in the field.
   4. We thus provide understanding of the known ecological impact of D.villosus and discuss the utility of the phenomenological use of comparative functional responses and resource use as a tool through which the potential ecological impacts of invasive species may be identified.

AB Salinization of rivers resulting from industrial discharge or road-deicing can adversely affect macroinvertebrates. Trait-based approaches are a promising tool in ecological monitoring and may perform better than taxonomy-based approaches. However only little is known how and which biological traits are affected by salinization. We investigated the effects of anthropogenic salinization on macroinvertebrate communities and biological traits in the Werra River, Germany and compared the taxonomic and trait response.
   We found a change in macroinvertebrate community and trait composition. Communities at saline sites were characterized by the three exotic species Gammarus tigrinus, Apocorophium lacustre and Potamopyrgus antipodarum. The frequencies of trait modalities long life cycle duration, respiration by gill, ovoviviparity, shredder and multivoltinism were statistically significantly increased at saline sites.
   The trait-based ordination resulted in a higher explained variance than the taxonomy-based ordination, indicating a better performance of the trait-based approach, resulting in a better discrimination between saline and non-saline sites. Our results are in general agreement with other studies from Europe, indicating a trait convergence for saline streams, being dominated by the traits ovoviviparity and multivoltinism. Three further traits (respiration by gill, life cycle duration and shredders) responded strongly to salinization, but this may primarily be attributed to the dominance of a single invasive species, G. tigrinus, at the saline sites in the Werra River.

AB Background: Under predicted climate change scenarios, estuaries and deltas face increased threats to biological sustainability. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA forms the upstream component of the largest estuary on the Pacific coast of the Americas. It is a Mediterranean system in steep ecological decline under threat from current and potential climate changes.
   Goal: Illustrate how climate change impacts on an already fragile system can be monitored with new, advanced remote sensing methods. Describe how remote sensing data can improve monitoring of ecosystem changes. Use examples from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California to illustrate some of the types of ecosystem changes that are expected with climate change, such as changing species composition and dominance, changes in environmental conditions like salinity, water and air temperatures, and precipitation patterns. Show how imaging spectroscopy can provide information about the dynamics of native and invasive estuarine plant communities.
   Data: Airborne HyMap imaging spectroscopy data of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta collected in June for the years 2004 through 2008. Approximately 65 flightlines covered the Delta each year with 3 x 3 m spatial resolution. Concurrent field data recorded geographical locations and phenology of different aquatic plant species. Airborne LiDAR data rasterized at 1 x 1 m, collected in winter 2007 for the entire Delta, was used to calculate light interception by riparian tree canopies.
   Analysis method: We used hyperspectral image analysis in various classification algorithms to perform vegetation type and species mapping, and estimate plant densities and functional traits. A radiative transfer model was applied to LiDAR data to estimate the effects of riparian tree canopies on the irradiance budget of the surface waters of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as a surrogate for potential water temperature increases.
   Results: New remote sensing techniques and data detected and measured the density and other functional traits of plant communities and species in this delta. Examining the year-to-year locations of pixels containing invasive species shows that they have high rates of persistence, and that the predicted increases in water temperature may improve the habitat conditions for invasive aquatic plant species. Other changes, such as altered precipitation patterns, may affect the hydrograph of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and its turbidity that could further improve the habitat for non-native species, although sea level rise and increasing upstream salinity might produce the opposite effect.
   Conclusions: The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Estuary face ecosystem problems that are characteristic of most Mediterranean estuaries. Interactions between the biological and physical conditions in the Delta affect the trajectory of dominance by native and invasive aquatic plant species. Trends in growth and community characteristics associated with predicted impacts of climate change (sea level rise, warmer temperatures, changes in the hydrograph with high winter and low summer outflows) do not provide simple predictions. Individually, the impact of specific environmental changes on the biological components can be predicted, however it is the complex interactions of biological communities with the suite of physical changes that make predictions uncertain. Systematic monitoring of these estuarine environments is critical to achieving sustainable management of these ecosystems and providing the data needed to document and understand change and to identify successful adaptation strategies.

AB We explore here the sensitivity and predictive power of quantified morphological and physiological properties of phytoplankton. We have adopted groups of species, distinguished by the clear morphological- and physiological-traits (Kruk et al., 2010; Litchman et al., 2010), and simulated their growth in various environments, using the model PROTECH (Phytoplankton RespOnses To Environmental CHange). This well-tested model uses equations fitted to optimal growth performances of various ("real") phytoplankton species, described in terms of their functional attributes. Thus, we are able to reconstruct successional series in a range of shallow and deep lakes, situated at set latitudes (temperate or "Mediterranean"). All sequences are initiated at equal biomass levels but they soon become dominated by Groups which responded positively to the changing environmental conditions. We show the selection of small algae under conditions of good light and resource abundance and their subsequent collapse, especially as a consequence of zooplankton consumption. We show the advantages accruing to larger organisms that escape grazing but may also be motile and better defend assembled biomass against loss. Lengthening of cells or filaments of many cells increases organismic size but preserves the high surface-to-volume ratios that aid optimal interception of underwater light in turbid, mixed layers. Nitrogen-fixing capability confers to appropriately adapted species the opportunity to dominate when diminishing supplies of nitrogen limit the growth of other algae. Models founded on trait-separated phytoplankton demonstrate the value of these properties to the description and interpretation of phytoplankton succession.

AB Elimination of sediments from river reservoirs is a common management problem for hydroelectric power plants. Periodical flushing can have negative impacts downstream. This study investigated the impact of a flushing event on the physico-chemical changes in the downstream sections and on the consequences for the benthic macroinvertebrate community. A special emphasis was placed on trace metal fate, partitioning and speciation. The assessment of taxonomic diversity and the frequency of taxa with specific traits was used to estimate the impact on the macroinvertebrate community. Trace metals were measured in the dissolved and particulate fraction, in the surface sediment and in selected macroinvertebrates. Bioanalogical diffusive gradient thin films (DGT) complemented the approach. The results showed an increase of Al, Co, Mn and Ni in the dissolved fraction (M-dis). Cr-dis, Fe-dis, Pb-dis, and Cu-dis showed strong spatial variation. In the exchangeable fraction of particulate metals, trends were contrasted, depending on the metal. The calculated free ion and DGT concentrations increased during the flush for all metals, except for Cu. Accumulation in invertebrates increased only in a small number of cases. Macroinvertebrate diversity was negatively impacted as shown by lower taxonomic richness and rarefied richness after the event. Trait profiles were also affected. Overall, the study revealed that flushing operations have an impact on trace metal partitioning between dissolved, suspended particulate matter and sediments, metal speciation, as well as the functional invertebrate diversity.

AB Benthic communities were studied twice (during the autumn and spring) in three Mediterranean coastal lagoons located in Greece (Logarou) and Italy (Cesine and Grado-Marano). The species composition and distribution, community diversity, species richness, dominant taxa and their ecological identity, benthic trophic and biomass size structure were investigated in these lagoons and the results were correlated with the environmental variables. The overall similarity based on species composition and abundance among the lagoons was low due to the differences in the dominant environmental factors, whereas the variations in the community diversity and species richness were mainly related to the degree of marine influence, reflecting the natural structure. The benthic classification indices AMBI, M-AMBI, BENTIX, BO2A, ISD and ISS were applied to assess the ecological status of the lagoons studied. The results revealed that the biotic indices AMBI, M-AMBI, BENTIX, and BO2A were not adequately efficient due to the natural dominance of the tolerant and opportunistic species and the correlation of the species diversity with natural stress. The ISD and ISS, on the other hand, based on size distribution frequencies and on size spectra sensitivity, respectively, showed good discrimination power among the impacted and unimpacted sites. The results indicate that except for species sensitivity, other traits of the communities such as the biomass or size structure could be more robust, sensitive and suitable for assessing the ecological quality of lagoons.

AB Trophic polymorphism, defined as the state in which two or more clearly different feeding functional traits exist within the same population of a species, is general in fishes. In aquatic ecosystems, the fishes often have strong impacts on prey communities as keystone predators, so that phenotypic divergence of their feeding traits can alter biotic and abiotic attributes of environments through changes in the form of trophic interactions. The predator-induced environmental alterations may, in turn, drive evolutionary changes in adaptive traits of themselves as well as of other members in the communities. This process, in which ecology and evolution reciprocally interplay over contemporary time-scales, is termed "eco-evolutionary feedback." In this chapter, we review how and when trophic polymorphism has been generated in fish populations and then discuss what consequences it has in ecological and evolutionary aspect. Special references are made to the case in the ancient Lake Biwa, which has a geological history long enough for divergent fish populations to come to ecological speciation and thus provides a good opportunity to understand how such an evolutionary process diversifies biological communities and consequently ecosystem properties in lakes.

AB The distribution of functional traits within and across spatiotemporal scales has been used to quantify and infer the relative resilience across ecosystems. We use explicit spatial modeling to evaluate within-and cross-scale redundancy in headwater streams, an ecosystem type with a hierarchical and dendritic network structure. We assessed the cross-scale distribution of functional feeding groups of benthic invertebrates in Swedish headwater streams during two seasons. We evaluated functional metrics, i.e., Shannon diversity, richness, and evenness, and the degree of redundancy within and across modeled spatial scales for individual feeding groups. We also estimated the correlates of environmental versus spatial factors of both functional composition and the taxonomic composition of functional groups for each spatial scale identified. Measures of functional diversity and within-scale redundancy of functions were similar during both seasons, but both within-and cross-scale redundancy were low. This apparent low redundancy was partly attributable to a few dominant taxa explaining the spatial models. However, rare taxa with stochastic spatial distributions might provide additional information and should therefore be considered explicitly for complementing future resilience assessments. Otherwise, resilience may be underestimated. Finally, both environmental and spatial factors correlated with the scale-specific functional and taxonomic composition. This finding suggests that resilience in stream networks emerges as a function of not only local conditions but also regional factors such as habitat connectivity and invertebrate dispersal.

AB To investigate the influence of macrofaunal species on recovery in soft-sediment habitats, a multi-site defaunation experiment was conducted in intertidal sandflats in Mahurangi Harbour, New Zealand. Paired treatment and control plots were monitored for 394 d after defaunation, and the recovery trajectories of individual species and their relationships with environmental factors were evaluated over time. Recruitment events were not apparent drivers of recovery, as we observed a massive recruitment of some species by Day 203, but the abundance of these individuals largely decreased by the end of the experiment, regardless of location in the estuary or hydrodynamics. Multiple regression models revealed highly variable responses, but suggested that several factors including sediment type and post-settlement species interactions contributed to species persistence in recovering plots. Juveniles generally settled at sites where adults from the same taxa occurred in the ambient community, suggesting local settlement patterns. Populations of functionally important surface deposit feeders and suspension feeders, including the large bivalves Austrovenus stutchburyi and Macomona liliana, failed to recover at most sites. The latter is likely one of the major drivers of divergence between disturbed and control plots in this experiment. The generally slow recovery dynamics, the degree of divergence of recovering communities and the failure of some key functions to recover have important implications for the response trajectories of coastal benthic communities subjected to increasingly frequent disturbance.

AB Heading date was an important trait that decided the adaptation of wheat to environments. It was modified by genes involved in vernalization response, photoperiod response and development rate. In this study, four loci Xgwm261, Xgwm219, Xbarc23 and Ppd-D1 which were previously reported related to heading time were analyzed based on three groups of wheat including landraces (L), varieties bred before 1983 (B82) and after 1983 (A83) collected from Chinese wheat growing areas. Generally, heading date of landrace was longer than that of varieties. Significant differences in the heading time existed within the groups, which implied that diversification selection was much helpful for adaptation in each wheat zone. Photoperiod insensitive allele Ppd-D1a was the first choice for both landrace and modern varieties, which promoted the heading date about four days earlier than that of sensitive allele Ppd-D1b. The three SSR loci had different characters in the three groups. Predominant allele combination for each zone was predicted for wheat group L and A83, which made great contribution to advantageous traits. Xgwm219 was found to be significantly associated with heading date in Yellow and Huai River Winter Wheat Zone (Zone II) and spike length in Middle and lower Yangtze Valley Winter Wheat Zone (Zone III), which implied functional diversification for adaption. Variation for earliness genes provided here will be helpful for whet breeding in future climatic change.

AB Macroecology studies large-scale patterns aiming to identify the effects of general ecological processes. Although lakes (and ponds) are particularly suited for macroecological research due to their discrete nature and non geographically-structured variability, the development of this discipline in lentic habitats is comparatively much smaller than for terrestrial environments. This is despite the interest of limnologists for large-scale phenomena, which results in the high level of development of some disciplines such as predictive limnology. Here we discuss how current state-of-the-art in macroecology may benefit from research in lentic habitats at five topics. First, by including an island biogeography analytical framework to incorporate the effects of lake origin and history on lentic biodiversity. Second, by studying local and regional effects on the latitudinal gradients of species richness. Third, by considering lakes and ponds altogether for the study of beta diversity and metacommunity structure, which is already common ground in limnological research. Fourth, by relating species traits with ecosystem structure and functioning; here we consider in particular the potential effects of body size-determined dispersal and competitive exclusion processes on lake-wide trophic organization. And fifth, by incorporating current research in functional (i.e., trait) and phylogenetic diversity to the study of community structure. We finally conclude that lentic habitats can be particularly important for the development of the most functional aspects of macroecology, due to the relative ease of studying the different biotic and abiotic components of the system separately, compared to most terrestrial systems. This can allow teasing apart many of the confounding factors that are characteristic of macroecological research, thus helping the development of future theoretical syntheses.

AB Biotic interactions in aquatic communities are dominated by predation, and the distribution of trophic link strengths in aquatic food webs crucially impacts their dynamics and stability. Although individual body size explains a large proportion of variation in trophic link strengths in aquatic habitats, current predominately body size-based views can gain additional realism by incorporating further traits. Functional traits that potentially affect the strength of trophic links can be classified into three groups: i) body size, ii) traits that identify the spatiotemporal overlap between the predators and their prey, and iii) predator foraging and prey vulnerability traits, which are readily available for many taxa. Relationship between these trait groups and trophic link strength may be further modified by population densities, habitat complexity, temperature and other abiotic factors. I propose here that this broader multi-trait framework can utilize concepts, ideas and existing data from research on metabolic ecology, ecomorphology, animal personalities and role of habitats in community structuring. The framework can be used to investigate non-additive effects of traits on trophic interactions, shed more light on the structuring of local food webs and evaluate the merits of taxonomic and functional group approaches in the description of predator-prey interactions. Development of trait-and size-based descriptions of food webs could be particularly fruitful in limnology given the relative paucity of well resolved datasets in standing waters.

AB Effective environmental flow management depends on identification of ecologically-relevant flow attributes to maintain or restore flows in the context of other natural and human influences on stream ecosystems. This study in subtropical eastern Australia identified associations of fish with climatic and flow gradients, catchment topography, reach geology, habitat structure and land use across 20 catchments. Land-use patterns and associated stressors accounted for very little variation in fish assemblage structure. Of the 35 fish species analysed, 24 were strongly associated with gradients in mean daily flows and their variability, baseflow, number of zero-flow days and high-flow pulses, magnitude of the 1-year annual return interval flood and the constancy and predictability of monthly flows. The finding that 22 species (benthic and pelagic) were associated with gradients of antecedent low-flow hydrology indicates that these species (or functional trait groups) should be the focus of further analysis to explore hydro-ecological relationships in systems with regulated flow regimes.

AB Freshwater habitats and organisms are among the most threatened on Earth, and freshwater ecosystems have been subject to large biodiversity losses. We developed a Climate Change Sensitivity (CCS) indicator based on trait information for a selection of stream-and lake-dwelling Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa. We calculated the CCS scores based on ten species traits identified as sensitive to global climate change. We then assessed climate change sensitivity between the six main ecoregions of Sweden as well as the three Swedish regions based on Illies. This was done using biological data from 1,382 stream and lake sites where we compared large-scale (ecoregional) patterns in climate change sensitivity with potential future exposure of these ecosystems to increased temperatures using ensemble-modelled future changes in air temperature. Current (1961 similar to 1990) measured temperature and ensemble-modelled future (2100) temperature showed an increase from the northernmost towards the southern ecoregions, whereas the predicted temperature change increased from south to north. The CCS indicator scores were highest in the two northernmost boreal ecoregions where we also can expect the largest global climate change-induced increase in temperature, indicating an unfortunate congruence of exposure and sensitivity to climate change. These results are of vital importance when planning and implementing management and conservation strategies in freshwater ecosystems, e.g., to mitigate increased temperatures using riparian buffer strips. We conclude that traits information on taxa specialization, e.g., in terms of feeding specialism or taxa having a preference for high altitudes as well as sensitivity to changes in temperature are important when assessing the risk from future global climate change to freshwater ecosystems.

AB We investigated the impact of fish farming on the benthic biota of 2 habitats (sea-grass meadows of Posidonia oceanica and non-vegetated soft bottoms), by examining in detail the nematode assemblages, and the effects of organic enrichment on their abundance, diversity (species richness and trophic diversity), community structure and individual size. All investigated faunal variables differed significantly between impact and control sediments, except for individual nematode biomass. Nematodes displayed reduced biodiversity beneath the investigated fish farms in both vegetated and non-vegetated habitats. The nematode genera Richtersia, Desmoscolex and Halalaimus were highly sensitive to biodeposition and disappeared almost completely in farm sediments, whereas other genera such as Daptonema and Prochromadorella largely increased their relative abundance. The impact of biodeposition was investigated also in terms of K-dominance curves and functional variables (life strategies as maturity index, and functional [i.e. trophic] diversity) which showed that nematodes are very sensitive to this kind of environmental disturbance. Our results indicate that the analysis of nematode assemblage composition, the life traits of the dominant species and the presence/disappearance of certain nematode species represent a reliable tool for monitoring the quality state of marine sediments exposed to fish-farm organic wastes.

AB The California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), a temperate marine region dominated by episodic upwelling, is predicted to experience rapid environmental change in the future due to ocean acidification. The aragonite saturation state within the California Current System is predicted to decrease in the future with near-permanent undersaturation conditions expected by the year 2050. Thus, the CCLME is a critical region to study due to the rapid rate of environmental change that resident organisms will experience and because of the economic and societal value of this coastal region. Recent efforts by a research consortium - the Ocean Margin Ecosystems Group for Acidification Studies (OMEGAS) - has begun to characterize a portion of the CCLME; both describing the spatial mosaic of pH in coastal waters and examining the responses of key calcification-dependent benthic marine organisms to natural variation in pH and to changes in carbonate chemistry that are expected in the coming decades. In this review, we present the OMEGAS strategy of co-locating sensors and oceanographic observations with biological studies on ben-thic marine invertebrates, specifically measurements of functional traits such as calcification-related processes and genetic variation in populations that are locally adapted to conditions in a particular region of the coast. Highlighted in this contribution are (1) the OMEGAS sensor network that spans the west coast of the US from central Oregon to southern California, (2) initial findings of the carbonate chemistry amongst the OMEGAS study sites, and (3) an overview of the biological data that describes the acclimatization and the adaptation capacity of key benthic marine invertebrates within the CCLME.

AB Environmental warming can have negative effects on the carrying capacity of communities because metabolic rates increase at the expense of biomass. Here, we tested the hypothesis that such warming effects are reversed in communities experiencing disturbance, as temperature-driven growth processes gain relevance and can compensate for negative disturbance effects. Model communities of semi-natural, biofilm-dwelling ciliates were cultivated in mesocosms (river bypass systems) under two temperature regimes (ambient temperature and increased by 4 degrees C). The interactive effects between these different temperatures and seven disturbance intensities were tested in a nested design. Disturbance generally reduced total ciliate abundances, whereas only small effects on the prevalence of functional diversity were detected. Temperature effects differed between different disturbance intensities and seasons: Whereas warming reduced the carrying capacity of undisturbed communities irrespective of the season, pronounced positive warming effects were detected under disturbance in winter and, to a lesser extent, in spring. Neither significant temperature nor disturbance effects were recorded in summer, probably because ciliate growth rates were not temperature limited due to high summer background temperatures. Our results show that disturbance can markedly alter warming effects on temperature limited communities. Since natural communities commonly face disturbance, it should therefore be considered in models of future environmental warming responses.

AB Streambed colmation by fine sediment, e.g. the deposition, accumulation and storage of fines in the substrate, is known to have severe effects on invertebrate assemblages in both the benthic and hyporheic zones but the changes in biological attributes of invertebrate assemblages related to colmation have never been considered simultaneously for these two zones. We studied the effects of colmation on the invertebrate assemblages of three rivers, testing a priori hypotheses on the biological attributes that should be more selected in communities subjected to different levels of colmation in both zones. Only the proportion of organisms with high fecundity increased and the proportion of small-sized organisms decreased along the colmation gradient in both zones simultaneously. As expected, a higher number of traits were significantly modified with colmation in the benthic vs. hyporheic assemblages. Most of the biological attributes impaired were different in the two zones. In the benthic zone, colmation mainly selected particular physiological or trophic characteristics of species and features related to their resistance or resilience capacities. In contrast, the morphological attributes of species were much more impaired by colmation in the hyporheic zone than in the benthic zone. In clogged benthic habitats, traits seemed to be more impaired by an increase in physico-chemical constraints (e.g. the reduction of oxygen availability) and a reduction of potential exchanges (including exchanges of food resources) due to a decline in stream bed conductivity. The morphological attributes of the hyporheic species were probably more influenced by changes in interstitial space characteristics. A potential indicator of the effects of colmation on river health may be based on the functional traits of benthic communities because they (i) satisfy the WFD recommendations, (ii) respond consistently along a colmation gradient and (iii) are comparable among assemblages even across ecoregions that differ in their taxonomic composition.

AB In response to temporal changes in the quality and availability of food resources, consumers should adjust their foraging behavior in a manner that maximizes energy and nutrient intake and, when resources are limiting, minimizes dietary overlap with other consumers. Floodplains of the Amazon and its lowland tributaries are characterized by strong, yet predictable, hydrological seasonality, seasonal availability of fruits, seeds, and other food resources of terrestrial origin, and diverse assemblages of frugivorous fishes, including morphologically similar species of several characiform families. Here, we investigated how diets of frugivorous fishes in the Amazon change in response to fluctuations in food availability, and how this influences patterns of interspecific dietary overlap. We tested predictions from classical theories of foraging and resource competition by estimating changes in diet breadth and overlap across seasons. We monitored fruiting phenology to assess food availability, and surveyed local fish populations during three hydrological seasons in an oligotrophic river and an adjacent oxbow lake in the Colombian Amazon. We analyzed stomach contents and stable isotope data to evaluate temporal and interspecific relationships for dietary composition, breadth, and overlap. Diets of six species of characiform fishes representing three genera changed according to seasonal fluctuations in food availability, and patterns of diet breadth and interspecific overlap during the peak flood pulse were consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory. During times of high fruit abundance, fishes consumed items to which their functional morphological traits seemed best adapted, potentially enhancing net energy and nutritional gains. As the annual flood pulse subsided and availability of forest food resources in aquatic habitats changed, there was not a consistent pattern of diet breadth expansion or compression. Nonetheless, shifts in both diet composition and stable isotope ratios of consumer tissues during this period resulted in trophic niche segregation in a pattern consistent with competition theory.

AB The study investigates the effect of the salinity gradient on the functional composition, functional diversity and functional redundancy of soft-bottom communities in the south-western Baltic Sea. For this purpose, three different areas were selected and compared using a biological trait approach. Functional diversity was calculated by using Rao's Quadratic Entropy as a measure and functional redundancy by the ratio between functional and species diversity.
   Despite a high variability due to different other occurring environmental gradients, a clear shift in functional composition was visible using the BTA approach. The changes were most distinct for the traits, longevity and larvae type if the analyses were based on the biomass of the species, whereas abundance-based analyses tend to show less clear results.
   Along the same gradient, functional diversity and functional redundancy tended to increase if biomass data were used in the analysis. On the other hand no changes could be observed in the functional diversity when the abundance of the species was used.
   The result of the BTA showed a trend from long-lived and highly specialised species towards short-lived ubiquitous species with decreasing salinity. However, dominance of ubiquitous species in brackish waters seems to buffer the functional loss. Therefore it can be followed that by gaining functional redundancy the robustness of the benthic ecosystem to environmental changes increases.. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Haploops nirae is a gregarious tubiculous amphipod which extended its habitat over thousands of hectares in shallow waters of South Brittany bays (Bay of Biscay, Atlantic) over the last decades and created uniquely large and dense tube mats. In the bay of Concameau, we investigated the specific diversity (i.e. species richness and species composition) and the functional structure (using biological traits) of the macrofauna associated with this Haploops community as a comparison with several surrounding soft-sediment communities to determine the effect of this engineer species on ecosystem functions. We showed that the occurrence of Haploops tubes and individuals significantly modifies sediment features (e.g. change in sediment grain size, increase in C and N organic content) but also largely affect species diversity and benthic composition. The species richness was significantly higher in Haploops community but the species assemblage associated with Haploops habitat was very homogeneous compared to the neighboring habitats and unique with 33% of all species exclusively found in this community. Multivariate analysis (dbRDA) revealed that Haploops density was by far the factor explaining the variation in species composition of benthic communities. No differences in species diversity and assemblage were detected in relationship to Haploops density. A biological trait analysis performed on the whole ecosystem (Haploops included) revealed that Haploops largely dominates the functional structure of the Haploops community by its own functional traits. When performed on selected traits of the associated fauna only (Haploops excluded) the functional structure of the Haploops community was characterized by a greatly reduced proportion of small to medium long lived, sensitive to disturbance, free living or burrowing/tube-building filter-feeding species. H. nirae appears to be a bioengineer and a foundation species that largely modifies its hydro-sedimentary features, controlling diversity and abundances of associated species, and creating a complex set of positive and negative interactions so that a unique benthic assemblage is found in sediments they colonized.

AB The gut contents of 2982 specimens of 33 amphipod families, 71 genera and 149 species were examined, representing a high percentage of amphipod diversity in the Iberian Peninsula. Material was collected mainly from sediments, algae and hydroids along the whole coast of the Iberian Peninsula from 1989 to 2011. Although detritus was the dominant food item in the majority of amphipods, gammarideans also included carnivorous (mainly feeding on crustaceans) and herbivorous species (feeding on macroalgal tissues). Our study revealed that general assignment of a type of diet for a whole family is not always adequate. Some families showed a consistent pattern in most of the studied species (Corophiidae, Pontoporeiidae = detritivorous; Oedicerotidae, Phoxocephalidae, Stenothoidae = carnivorous; Ampithoidae = primarily herbivorous on macroalgae), but others included species with totally different feeding strategies. In general terms, detritivorous families were characterized by a stronger mandibular molar, while in carnivorous taxa this feature was less developed or reduced. The percentage of macroalgae in the digestive contents was associated in most cases with a reduction or loss of the mandibular palp. It seems that high trophic diversity in amphipods is a generalized trait along different ecosystems in all latitudes, and could be related to the ecological success of this group in marine benthic communities.

AB Phytoplankton requires a sufficient supply of light and nutrients to grow. At the same time it is largely entrained in water motion and is subject to grazing from planktonic herbivores. The pelagic life of lake phytoplankton is based on 4 pillars: living in suspension, light harvesting, nutrient uptake, and escape from grazing. Environmental variability and the uneven distribution of resources among and within the different aquatic ecosystems exert a selective pressure on these organisms, which are formed by a single cell or by colonies with either relatively low or high numbers of cells. Phytoplankton displays an amazing morphological variability representing an adaptation to spatial and temporal variability of their environments. Among functional traits of phytoplankton, morphological features such as shape and size represent an unavoidable starting point to fully understand the relationships between this group of organisms and its environment. The molding effect of environmental variables on phytoplankton morphology is particularly evident in highly dynamic environments such as reservoirs or ponds. The analysis of phytoplankton morphology can thus supply important information on the ecological conditions of a given waterbody. To support this hypothesis, data are presented on the main morphological features of phytoplankton from a 20-year limnological investigation carried out in a Mediterranean man-made lake. The results show that phytoplankton morphological variability reflects different environmental scenarios, and that the morphological features of phytoplankton represent a powerful tool to assess the ecological or trophic state of aquatic ecosystems.

AB Our study challenges the functional approach for its usefulness in assessing the consequences of hypoxia disturbance events on macrofaunal communities in the south-western Baltic Sea. Time series for two decades of observations from two monitoring stations, one in the Fehmarnbelt (exposed to aperiodic hypoxia), and another in the Darss Rise (normoxic conditions) is used. Our results designate differences of functional structure of benthic fauna communities between sites based on biological traits that characterise species role in modifying the environment, behavioural strategies, morphology and life history, thus suggesting differences in functioning. Hypoxic years reveal sharp increase of the role of sedentary species, suspension filter feeders, epibenthic structures, globulose form, medium/large size of individuals, preponderance of species with long lifespan (caused for instance by remaining ocean quahog). The link of functional and species diversity to the stagnation periods is proposed for the Darss station that exhibit continuous changes and low temporal variability of traits distribution. Before the major inflow in 1993 the increased role of small size organisms, containing calcium carbonate, filter feeders and grazers, higher presence of semi-pelagic species is observed. The hypoxic events and water renewal processes impact the communities not only in respect to species composition but also functionally. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of genetic variation in evolution is well established. Yet, the mechanisms by which genetic variation-particularly variation in traits under selection-is maintained in natural populations has long been an evolutionary puzzle. Understanding individual variables driving selection and their functional mechanisms is increasingly important in the context of global change and its potential consequences for biodiversity. Here we examined intra-population performance among allelic variants of a pleiotropic locus in response to thermal stress in the variable platyfish, Xiphophorus variatus. The wild-type tailspot allele exhibited significantly lower heat tolerance than all three pattern alleles found in the population, conforming to predictions based on previously observed correlations between temperature and pattern frequencies in the wild. Furthermore, differences between tailspot pattern frequencies in adults and juveniles were broadly consistent with this trend. Thus, it appears that physiological stress and reduced performance of the wild-type allele at higher relative temperatures is a mechanism balancing its frequency in natural populations. Temperature variation and not dissolved oxygen alone, as previously reported, is likely a important abiotic variable contributing to the maintenance of adaptive polymorphism. Furthermore, our findings underscore the potential implications of rising temperatures and physiological stress for levels of genetic variation in natural populations.

AB The first goal of this study was to determine whether morphological variation in the freshwater blenny Salaria fluviatilis results in spatially structured populations distributed around Corsica, France, which would suggest genetically differentiated populations through reproductive isolation by distance. The second goal was to determine whether some morphological traits are related to water velocity, one of the most contrasting habitat characteristics in these rivers, which would suggest an adaptation to local conditions. The results showed that the morphology of S. fluviatilis differed among the three main geographic areas studied in Corsica and that geographically distant populations of S. fluviatilis were less similar morphologically and genetically than close ones. The results also indicated that the morphological differences among populations conformed to functional expectations. Overall, the results suggest that the morphological variation of S. fluviatilis from Corsican rivers is an adaptive response to water velocity and that these populations are in a process of reproductive isolation by distance.

AB Declining vegetation coverage caused by serious soil erosion in dry-hot river valley of the Jinsha River has resulted in a vicious cycle of environmental deterioration and aggravated soil erosion. In order to identify the relationship between vegetation succession and transformation of soil erosion, the methods of "space replacing time" and Cs-137 technique have been used to analyze community structure of vegetation and distribution characteristics of Cs-137 contents in the slopes and vegetation units of five succession stages, which included native grassland, shrub, sapling forest, half-mature forest and near mature forest in Jiangjiagou gully, Dongchuan city, Yunnan province. We found, during the course of succession, the number of species in communities increased with vegetation development and succession, but the Cs-137 loss decreased with vegetation succession. Following the succession, near mature forest had the highest Cs-137 inventory and native grassland had the lowest Cs-137 inventory in both slopes and vegetation units. Principal component analysis showed that Cs-137 inventory was significantly positively correlated with average crown diameter of tree (ACDT), species number, tree coverage and average tree height. Average crown diameter of shrub (ACDS) and average shrub height were also positively related to Cs-137 inventory but to a lesser extent. Based on the results of our study, we illustrated the improvement of soil erosion control through soil conservation and water regulation with vegetation succession. Consequently, the results suggest that community features significantly affect soil erosion, through which we can evaluate and predict the soil erosion intensity of different vegetation.

AB Adaptation to salinity affects species distributions, promotes speciation, and guides many evolutionary patterns in fishes. To uncover the basis of a complex trait like osmoregulation, genome-level analyses are sensible. We combine population genomic scans with genome expression profiling to discover candidate genes and pathways associated with divergence between osmotic environments. We compared transcriptome sequence divergence between multiple freshwater and saltwater populations of the rainwater killifish, Lucania parva. We also compared sequence divergence between L.parva and its sister species, Lucania goodei, a freshwater specialist. We found highly differentiated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between freshwater and saltwater L.parva populations in cell junction and ion transport genes, including V-type H+ ATPase. Between species, we found divergence in reproduction and osmotic stress genes. Genes that were differentially expressed between species during osmotic acclimation included genes involved in ion transport and cell volume regulation. Gene sets that were divergent in coding sequence and divergent in expression did not overlap, although they did converge in function. Like many studies using genomic scans, our approach may miss some loci that contribute to adaptation but have complicated patterns of allelic variation. Our study suggests that gene expression and coding sequence may evolve independently as populations adapt to a complex physiological challenge.

AB The question of whether species co-occurrence is random or deterministic has received considerable attention, but little is known about how anthropogenic disturbance mediates the outcomes. By combining experiments, field surveys and analysis against null models, we tested the hypothesis that anthropogenic habitat modification disrupts species co-occurrence in stream invertebrates across spatial scales. Whereas communities in unmodified conditions were structured deterministically with significant species segregation, catchment-scale conversion to agriculture and sediment deposition at the patch- or micro-habitat scale apparently randomized species co-occurrences. This shift from non-random to random was mostly independent of species richness, abundance and spatial scale. Data on community-wide life-history traits (body size, dispersal ability and predatory habits) and beta-diversity indicated that anthropogenic modification disrupted community assembly by affecting biotic interactions and, to a lesser extent, altering habitat heterogeneity. These data illustrate that the balance between predictable and stochastic patterns in communities can reflect anthropogenic modifications that not only transcend scales but also change the relative forces that determine species coexistence. Research into the effects of habitat modification as a key to understanding global change should extend beyond species richness and composition to include species co-occurrence, species interactions and any functional consequences.

AB QuestionHow does the interaction between silicon (Si) and vegetation affect local and global ecological processes, higher levels of ecological organization, and terrestrial- and watershed-scale Si fluxes?
   LocationWe selected several ecosystems throughout the world, from river headwaters to estuaries, being examples of (i) terrestrial vegetation, (ii) aquatic and floodplain vegetation, and (iii) tidal wetland vegetation.
   MethodsWe provide examples of the importance of linking Si use by terrestrial and aquatic vegetation, to larger-scale Si flux consequences towards and through rivers. Cross-disciplinary studies achieve the best understanding of vegetation effects on the global Si cycle, and the role of Si as a plant functional trait.
   ConclusionSi use by plants has not always received the research attention of other elements. Yet, today the importance of Si for plant functioning is slowly becoming better understood. Silicon is a crucial element for many plant species, being important for decomposition processes, plant competitiveness and stress tolerance. The inclusion by vegetation scientists of Si uptake as a plant functional trait is important to assess links between plant physiology, plant distribution and plant tolerance to environmental changes, but also to understand the role of vegetation on Si fluxes through the watershed. However, lack of knowledge regarding the biological control of the Si cycle hinders accurate quantification. Only a concerted effort bringing scientists together from a broad array of disciplines will provide this new direction for research on vegetation-Si cycling.

A dataset of bio-ecological traits of 1,942 Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa was used to analyze (1) the relationships among traits, (2) the potential vulnerability of EPT species to climate change, and (3) the geographical occurrence patterns of these potentially endangered species at the scale of European ecoregions. By means of a fuzzy correspondence analysis (FCA), two gradients emerged: (1) a longitudinal gradient, describing successive upstream-downstream features, and (2) a biogeographical gradient, separating endemic and micro-endemic species from widely distributed taxa. Moreover, aquatic insects of southern European ecoregions emerged as those most endangered in terms of potential vulnerability to climate change. Comparative multi-taxon studies provide important new insights into freshwater ecosystem functioning and responses to climate change, and could be the first step toward developing integrative monitoring or assessment tools (e.g., trait-based indicators at the species level) by means of non-arbitrary statistical methods.

AB Background: The evolution of ecological divergence in closely related species is a key component of adaptive radiation. However, in most examples of adaptive radiation the mechanistic basis of ecological divergence remains unclear. A classic example is seen in the young benthic and limnetic stickleback species pairs of British Columbia. In each pair the benthic species feeds on littoral macroinvertebrates whereas the limnetic feeds on pelagic zooplankton. Previous studies indicate that in both short-term feeding trials and long-term enclosure studies, benthics and limnetics exhibit enhanced performance on their own resource but fare more poorly on the other species' resource. We examined the functional basis of ecological divergence in the stickleback species pair from Paxton Lake, BC, using biomechanical models of fish feeding applied to morphological traits. We examined the consequences of morphological differences using high speed video of feeding fish.
   Results: Benthic stickleback possess morphological traits that predict high suction generation capacity, including greatly hypertrophied epaxial musculature. In contrast, limnetic stickleback possess traits thought to enhance capture of evasive planktonic prey, including greater jaw protrusion than benthics and greater displacement advantage in both the lower jaw-opening lever system and the opercular four-bar linkage. Kinematic data support the expectations from the morphological analysis that limnetic stickleback exhibit faster strikes and greater jaw protrusion than benthic fish, whereas benthics exert greater suction force on attached prey.
   Conclusions: We reveal a previously unknown suite of complex morphological traits that affect rapid ecological divergence in sympatric stickleback. These results indicate that postglacial divergence in stickleback involves many functional systems and shows the value of investigating the functional consequences of phenotypic divergence in adaptive radiation.

   ECOLOGY; CARBON
AB Previous studies have shown variable relationships between dispersal rate and ecosystem functioning, but the reasons for and mechanisms behind variable dispersal rate - functioning patterns are currently unknown. In this study we used six bacterial lake water communities in a laboratory experiment in order to investigate how dispersal among communities influences community productivity by evaluating three different mechanisms: 1) changes in taxonomic diversity, 2) changes in phylogenetic diversity or 3) changes in the composition of functional traits. The experiment was conducted in two phases; (A) a dialysis bag experiment where the dispersal rate among six communities was manipulated and the subsequent change in bacterial diversity and growth rate was recorded, and (B) a regrowth experiment where we manipulated available resources to study how well a taxon grows on certain organic carbon resources, i.e. their functional traits. From experiment (B) we could thus estimate changes in functional traits in communities in experiment (A). Bacterial production was affected by dispersal, but not consistently among lakes. Neither change in taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity with dispersal could explain the observed dispersal - productivity relationships. Instead, changes in trait composition with dispersal, especially the communities' ability to use p-coumaric acid, an aromatic compound, could explain the observed dispersal - productivity relationships. Changes in this trait caused by dispersal seemed especially important for bacterial productivity in waters with a high aromaticity of the organic matter pool. We conclude that the effect of dispersal on bacterial communities can affect ecosystem functioning in different ways, through changes in functional key-traits which are important for the local environment.

AB Biological traits analysis (BTA) is considered to be a powerful technique for describing the ecological functioning of marine benthic assemblages. This study is the first to apply BTA to assess differences in the traits of benthic faunal assemblages between areas exposed to heavy and light trawling in a major upwelling ecosystem along the west coast of southern Africa. The data were collected from two sampling locations in Namibia and six sampling locations in South Africa. The intensity of trawling varied from area to area. Significant differences in biological traits (BT) were detected between heavily and lightly trawled areas. Weighted infaunal traits showed significant differences between heavily and lightly trawled areas for 17% of the traits investigated, while 24% of epifaunal traits investigated were significantly different between areas of different trawling intensities. This suggests that the measured BTs of the epifauna might be more sensitive to trawling disturbances than BTs of the infauna. The infaunal traits differed significantly between areas with larger or smaller proportions of sand and mud. Nevertheless, more of the significant differences in infaunal BTs were related to variations in trawling intensity than to variations in sediment composition. Significant modifications of BTs are likely to lead to modified functioning of the community and provide more general potential indicators for management than those based on species. The study confirms the need for more basic biological and life history data on macro-benthic invertebrates but nevertheless shows that BTA detected specific features that correlate with trawling intensity and that these features may be important for epifaunal assemblage functioning.

AB AimDendritic ecological networks (DENs), such as river systems, combine features that challenge the traditional conceptual views and empirical approaches applied to metacommunities. As a result of their dendritic branching geometry and stream flow directionality, they are strongly hierarchical and asymmetrical. We analysed the metacommunity structure of benthic diatoms in a large-scale river system with the aim of evaluating the importance of potential causal influences. Furthermore, we hypothesized that metacommunities of diatoms that are strongly attached to their substrata show a different spatial structure than metacommunities of other, more weakly attached diatoms.
   LocationThe study was carried out in the Dong River, a 32,275km(2) subtropical river network located in southern China.
   MethodsWe surveyed benthic diatom communities during three seasons (dry, intermediate and wet). Using partial redundancy analysis, we partitioned community variation among environmental models and different spatial eigenfunction models to evaluate the influence of alternative dispersal pathways (overland versus water course dispersal), stream directionality, man-made dams and diatom functional traits on diatom metacommunity structure.
   ResultsModels based on hydrological connections and water directionality represent spatial patterns better than overland distances, suggesting that the dynamics of benthic diatom metacommunities are mainly confined to the river network and influenced by the prevailing water flow. We found significant effects of man-made dams on the spatial structure of important limnological variables and diatom metacommunity structure. The metacommunity of strongly attached diatoms also showed a weaker signature of flow directionality than that of other growth forms, especially in seasons with high water levels.
   Main conclusionsWe conclude that the consideration of among-site connectivity, flow directionality and species traits is key to a better understanding of the spatial ecology of passively dispersing microbial organisms in river systems.

AB A trait-based approach was used to evaluate the restoration success of a moss layer transfer technique on the herbaceous community of a cut-over bog. In order to understand the herbaceous dynamics following restoration, the bog was monitored prior to restoration and biannually over ten subsequent years, in two initial drainage conditions (dry peat fields and wet ditches), and compared to seven undisturbed bogs. Herbaceous community found prior to and in the early stage after restoration were characterized by species associated to mesic soil conditions with a fen-like pH, ruderal or wetland species, species with mycorrhiza or exotic species. These species did not persist in the latter stage after restoration and were replaced by species that are carnivorous, are associated to variable water availability and show mostly sexual reproduction. The extent of changes in traits composition of the herbaceous community between the early and latter stages after restoration showed the importance of multiple-year monitoring to evaluate restoration projects. The trait composition found in the latter stage after restoration appeared to converge toward the reference ecosystem where the community was characterized by species with large seeds, associated to humid soil conditions and a forest or peatland habitat. Lower trait diversity was found in the latter stage after restoration than in the reference ecosystem, especially in peat fields. In addition, species and functional diversity pattern varied with the initial drainage conditions, decreasing in peat fields while remaining stable in ditches. This suggests that different initial topography for restoration might help increase species and functional diversity of a managed ecosystem. Finally, our results outline measures to improve the moss layer transfer technique: sowing herbaceous species with large seeds in the latter stage after restoration, applying the restoration technique as soon as exploitation has terminated or removing all vegetation (including seeds and rhizomes) from the site to be restored.

AB Growth hormone transgenic (GHTg) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) have enhanced growth when compared to their non-transgenic counterparts, and this trait can be beneficial for aquaculture production. Biological confinement of GHTg Atlantic salmon may be achieved through the induction of triploidy (3N). The growth rates of triploid GH transgenic (3NGHTg) Atlantic salmon juveniles were found to significantly vary between families in the AquaBounty breeding program. In order to characterize gene expression associated with enhanced growth in juvenile 3NGHTg Atlantic salmon, a functional genomics approach (32K cDNA microarray hybridizations followed by QPCR) was used to identify and validate liver transcripts that were differentially expressed between two fast-growing 3NGHTg Atlantic salmon families (AS11, AS26) and a slow-growing 3NGHTg Atlantic salmon family (AS25); juvenile growth rate was evaluated over a 45-day period. Of 687 microarray-identified differentially expressed features, 143 (116 more highly expressed in fast-growing and 27 more highly expressed in slow-growing juveniles) were identified in the AS11 vs. AS25 microarray study, while 544 (442 more highly expressed in fast-growing and 102 more highly expressed in slow-growing juveniles) were identified in the AS26 vs. AS25 microarray study. Forty microarray features (39 putatively associated with fast growth and 1 putatively associated with slow growth) were present in both microarray experiment gene lists. The expression levels of 15 microarray-identified transcripts were studied using QPCR with individual RNA samples to validate microarray results and to study biological variability of transcript expression. The QPCR results agreed with the microarray results for 12 of 13 putative fast-growth associated transcripts, but QPCR did not validate the microarray results for 2 putative slow-growth associated transcripts. Many of the 39 microarray-identified genes putatively associated at the transcript expression level with fast-growing 3NGHTg salmon juveniles (including APOA1, APOA4, B2M, FADSD6, FTM, and GAPDH) are involved in metabolism, iron homeostasis and oxygen transport, and immune- or stress-related responses. The results of this study increase our knowledge of family-specific impacts on growth rate and hepatic gene expression in juvenile 3NGHTg Atlantic salmon. In addition, this study provides a suite of putative rapid growth rate-associated transcripts that may contribute to the development of molecular markers [e.g. intronic, exonic or regulatory region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] for the selection of GHTg Atlantic salmon broodstock that can be utilized to produce sterile triploids of desired growth performance for future commercial applications.

AB Mediterranean climate ecosystems are characterised by frequent fires, but few studies have focused on the effects of fire disturbance on biological communities in streams in these ecosystems. To compare the responses of macroinvertebrate communities to wildfire, eight sites were established and annually sampled for 5 years. Two months after fire, the number and abundance of macroinvertebrate taxa were not significantly different from those in control streams, but their composition and functional attributes had changed. As expected, an increase in r-strategy taxa was observed during the year following fire. Above all, macroinvertebrate assemblages responded more strongly to hydrology (previous spring precipitation) than to fire. Drought was found to be an overriding disturbance factor, but macroinvertebrate assemblages showed high resilience. In a climate change scenario coupled with human demand for water, it will be important to study the effects of drought interacting with other disturbances like wildfire (which is in turn driven by drought).

AB The appropriate level of taxonomic identification, taxonomic sufficiency, for biomonitoring purposes continues to be controversial. Taxonomic sufficiency, however, fails to address the bias created by size-dependent taxonomic identification, which can result in coarse-resolution identification for immature specimens lacking distinguishing characteristics. Our study provides a direct test for this potential systematic bias in biomonitoring data by examining two morphological traits: body size and shape of key organisms (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata) collected from standard aquatic biomonitoring samples. Direct measurement of body size and a geometric morphometric description of body shape provide consistent, quantitative variables to describe the composition of specimens identified at different levels of taxonomic resolution (genus or family). Corroborating our expectations, we observed evidence of systematic size bias in family-level identifications. Specimens that could only reliably be identified to the family level were significantly smaller than specimens identified to the genus level. Qualitative comparisons of shape variation between specimens demonstrated a high degree of variation in specimens identified only at the family level and support the conclusion that specimens identified at the family level possess multiple constituent taxa (genera or species). Thus, size-dependent taxonomy can have negative consequences for the accurate determination of biodiversity and may invalidate common biomonitoring metrics. Improvements to biomonitoring protocols through technological advances, including DNA-based taxonomy to augment specimen identification, should effectively remove the size-bias problem in the long term. In the short-term, recognizing instances of size bias, the degree to which it may impact bioassessment and exploring methods for remediation, including traits-based assessments, can enhance data quality and inferences derived from biomonitoring studies.

AB The resources that organisms depend on often fluctuate over time, and a variety of common traits are thought to be adaptations to variable resource supply. To understand the trait structure of communities, it is necessary to understand the functional trade-offs that determine what trait combinations are possible and which species can persist and coexist in a given environment. We compare traits across phytoplankton species in order to test for proposed trade-offs between maximum growth rate, equilibrium competitive ability for phosphorus (P), and ability to store P. We find evidence for a three-way trade-off between these traits, and we use empirical trait covariation to parameterize a mechanistic model of competition under pulsed P supply. The model shows that different strategies are favored under different conditions of nutrient supply regime, productivity, and mortality. Furthermore, multiple strategies typically coexist, and the range of traits that persist in the model is similar to the range of traits found in real species. These results suggest that mechanistic models informed by empirical trait variation, in combination with data on the trait structure of natural communities, will play an important role in uncovering the mechanisms that underlie the diversity and structure of ecological communities.

AB The identification of the effects of toxicants on biological communities is hampered by the complexity and variability of communities. To overcome these challenges, the trait-based SPEAR approach has been developed. This approach is based on (i) identifying the vulnerable taxa using traits and (ii) aggregating these taxa into a group to reduce the between-replicate differences and scattered low-abundance distribution, both of which are typical for biological communities. This approach allows for reduction of the noise and determination of the effects of toxicants at low concentrations in both field and mesocosm studies. However, there is a need to quantitatively investigate its potential for mesocosm data evaluations and application in the ecological risk assessment of toxicants. In the present study, we analysed how the aggregation of the sensitive taxa can facilitate the identification of the effects. We used empirical data from a long-term mesocosm experiment with stream invertebrates and an insecticide as well as a series of simulated datasets characterised by different degrees of data matrix saturation (corresponding to different sampling efforts), numbers of replicates, and between-replicate differences. The analyses of both the empirical and simulated data sets revealed that the taxa aggregation approach allows for the detection of effects at a lower saturation of the data matrices, smaller number of replicates, and higher between-replicate differences when compared to the multivariate statistical method redundancy analysis. These improvements lead to a higher sensitivity of the analysed systems, as long-term effects were detected at lower concentrations (up to 1,000 times). These outcomes suggest that methods based on taxa aggregation have a strong potential for use in mesocosm data evaluations because mesocosm studies are usually poorly replicated, have high between-replicate variability, and cannot be exhaustively sampled due to technical and financial constraints.

AB Life-history knowledge is central to basic and applied ecology, but recent reviews show that knowledge of life histories of many freshwater invertebrates is incomplete because of difficulty in conducting such studies or a general decline of interest in natural-history research. We review and summarize published life histories for crayfishes native to the USA and Canada. We document the rate of accumulation of crayfish life-history knowledge and biases and gaps in life-history knowledge by taxonomic group, geography, habitat preference, and conservation status. A total of 78 published studies (59 papers; several included life-history information for multiple species) covering 42 (12%) of the 347 USA and Canadian crayfishes recognized as of 2007 met our criteria for crayfish life-history studies. Life-history studies were lacking for crayfishes of conservation concern and stygobitic or primary burrowing-habitat specialists. Life-history knowledge is relatively complete for low-diversity freshwater ecoregions of northern and western North America, but lacking for high-diversity freshwater ecoregions of the southeastern USA. From 1972 to 2007, an average of 3.40 new crayfish species/y were described, whereas 0.63 species/y were added to the list of crayfishes with published life-history studies. Thus, taxonomic knowledge is expanding faster than ecological or life-history knowledge of these same species, inevitably limiting our ability to manage and conserve them. We conclude with suggestions for increasing publication of crayfish life-history studies, and priorities for regions, taxonomic groups, and life-history traits that require urgent attention. We also present a database of existing crayfish life-history studies for researchers interested in life-history questions and to provide a foundation for traits-based inquiries into crayfish macroecology and applied questions in conservation like the prediction of extinction and invasion risk.

AB Deoxygenation has profound effects on marine biota and delivery of ecological functions in benthic systems. Globally, coastal and oceanic hypoxia is rapidly increasing due to anthropogenic activities including climate change and eutrophication. Little is known about the response of marine ecosystems to deoxygenation over long timescales and the consequences this will have for functioning. This study presents results from biological traits analysis (BTA) of 21 time averaged benthic palaeocommunities from the Wessex Basin, Dorset, UK representing 8 million years of fluctuating regional hypoxia during the Kimmeridgian ( 148-155 Ma). BTA assesses ecosystem functioning using biological traits expressed by species and has not previously been applied to palaeocommunity data. The preserved remains of the palaeocommunities contained gastropods, brachiopods, scaphopods, bryozoans, serpulids, hydroids and crustaceans, but were dominated by bivalves. Significant changes in species composition are shown within periods of less intense hypoxia, but during these periods trait composition did not significantly differ implying conservation of ecological function. However, significant changes in functioning occurred between periods of extremely different palaeoredox state. Proportionally more surface living or shallow burrowing species with traits suggestive of opportunists occurred during periods of low oxygen availability. Morphological differences of hypoxic communities included higher relative abundance of organisms with thinner skeletons (< 0.5 mm) composed of less soluble forms of calcite that may be linked to acidity. These changes are similar to those for modern benthos exposed to hypoxia. Investigation of functional changes that occurred during ancient hypoxic events can be used to infer the magnitude, thresholds, and rates of long-term functional change in modern communities. Results from this study suggest that during de-oxygenation delivery of normal benthic functioning will initially be maintained, but will collapse once thresholds are reached. This is consistent with the patterns emerging for contemporary systems where functional collapse is associated with hysteresis and threshold effects.

AB Understanding the various processes contributing to community assembly is among the central aims of ecology. As a means of exploring this topic we quantified the relative influences of habitat filtering and competition in establishing patterns of community functional trait diversity across a landscape of lakes. Habitat filtering has been invoked in shaping community structure when co-occurring taxa are more similar in their traits than expected by chance (under-dispersion), and competition has been inferred as a structuring agent when co-occurring taxa are less similar (over-dispersion). We tested these hypotheses in crustacean zooplankton communities using a functional trait-based approach based on five traits defining zooplankton feeding and habitat preferences across 51 lakes spanning several large limnological gradients. In general, zooplankton communities were functionally less diverse than random assemblages created from the same regional species pool. Furthermore, functional diversity was strongly correlated with variables related to lake productivity, suggesting that access to resources was the chief habitat filtering process constraining zooplankton functional diversity. This pattern was driven by the predominantly herbivorous cladocerans as opposed to the more commonly omnivorous, and sometimes carnivorous, copepods.

AB The geological history of the Ponto-Caspian region, with alternating cycles of isolation and reconnection among the three main basins (Black and Azov Seas, and the more distant Caspian Sea) as well as between them and the Mediterranean Sea, profoundly affected the diversification of its aquatic fauna, leading to a high degree of endemism. Two alternative hypotheses on the origin of this amazing biodiversity have been proposed, corresponding to phases of allopatric separation of aquatic fauna among sea basins: a Late Miocene origin (10-6 MYA) vs. a more recent Pleistocene ancestry (<2 MYA). Both hypotheses support a vicariant origin of (1) Black + Azov Sea lineages on the one hand, and (2) Caspian Sea lineages on the other. Here, we present a study on the Ponto-Caspian endemic amphipod Pontogammarus maeoticus. We assessed patterns of divergence based on (a) two mitochondrial and one nuclear gene, and (b) a morphometric analysis of 23 morphological traits in 16 populations from South and West Caspian Sea, South Azov Sea and North-West Black Sea. Genetic data indicate a long and independent evolutionary history, dating back from the late Miocene to early Pleistocene (6.6-1.6 MYA), for an unexpected, major split between (i) a Black Sea clade and (ii) a well-supported clade grouping individuals from the Caspian and Azov Seas. Absence of shared haplotypes argues against either recent or human-mediated exchanges between Caspian and Azov Seas. A mismatch distribution analysis supports more stable population demography in the Caspian than in the Black Sea populations. Morphological divergence largely followed patterns of genetic divergence: our analyses grouped samples according to the basin of origin and corroborated the close phylogenetic affinity between Caspian and Azov Sea lineages. Altogether, our results highlight the necessity of careful (group-specific) evaluation of evolutionary trajectories in marine taxa that should certainly not be inferred from the current geographical proximity of sea basins alone.

AB Climatic warming has induced marked shifts in the geographical distribution and seasonal phenology of many species, although the impacts of climatic changes on the interactions between species across trophic levels are far less well known. Freshwater microcosms were used to test the effect of temperature on the life history traits of a prey species, the fairy shrimp Chirocephalus diaphanus (Anostraca), the abundance of a predator, the microcrustacean Heterocypris incongruens (Ostracoda), and on the interaction between them. When reared in the absence of predators, C.diaphanus survival was low at the highest temperature (25 degrees C) and greatly reduced at the lowest temperature (5 degrees C). It was reproductively most successful at an intermediate temperature (20 degrees C), suggesting that it may benefit from the increase in temperature predicted under future climate change scenarios. In the absence of other species, temperature would have to increase dramatically to affect C.diaphanus adversely.Heterocypris incongruens was more abundant and its predation on C.diaphanus greatest at higher temperatures, partially offsetting the positive effect of raised temperature on prey observed when the predator was absent. The net effect was that the optimal temperature for C.diaphanus when coexisting with its predator was lower than when it was in isolation. This means that currently predicted increases in temperature ultimately may be detrimental to C.diaphanus. Predation rates were generally enhanced by high temperature, prey size and prey density, with significant interaction between them. Thus, the positive effects of raised temperature on predation rate were additionally dependent upon prey characteristics, being strongest when prey were large and at high density and weakest when prey were small and at low density. Interactions with a natural enemy, in this case a predator, may alter how species respond to raised temperatures; prey size and density further modify the outcome of this interaction. This context dependency in the response of both predators and prey to temperature suggests that the ecological impacts of future climate change on trophic interactions may be difficult to predict.

AB Riparian vegetation belts in arid regions of Central Asia are endangered to lose their ecosystem services due to intensified land use. For the development of sustained land use, management knowledge of plant performance in relation to resource supply is needed. We estimated productivity related functional traits at the edges of the habitat of Populus euphratica Oliv. Specific leaf area (SLA) and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio of P. euphratica leaves growing near a former river bank and close to moving sand dunes in the Ebinur Lake National Nature Reserve in Xinjiang, Northwest China (near Kazakhstan) were determined and daily courses of CO2 net assimilation (P (N)), transpiration (E), and stomatal conductance (g(s)) of two consecutive seasons were measured during July-August 2007 and June-July 2008. Groundwater level was high (1.5-2.5 m below ground) throughout the years and no flooding occurred at the two tree stands. SLA was slightly lower near the desert than at the former river bank and leaves contained less N in relation to C. Highest E and g(s) of P. euphratica were reached in the morning before noon on both stands and a second low maximum occurred in the afternoon despite of the unchanged high levels of air to leaf water vapor pressure deficit (ALVPD). Decline of g(s) in P. euphratica was followed by decrease of E. Water use efficiency (WUE) of leaves near the desert were higher in the morning and the evening, in contrast to leaves from the former river bank that maintained an almost stable level throughout the day. High light compensation points and high light saturation levels of P (N) indicated the characteristics of leaves well-adapted to intensive irradiation at both stands. In general, leaves of P. euphratica decreased their g(s) beyond 20 Pa/kPa ALVPD in order to limit water losses. Decrease of E did not occur in both stands until 40 Pa/kPa ALVPD was reached. Full stomatal closure of P. euphratica was achieved at 60 Pa/kPa ALVPD in both stands. E through the leaf surface amounted up to 30% of the highest E rates, indicating dependence on water recharge from the ground despite of obviously closed stomata. A distinct leaf surface temperature (T-leaf) threshold of around 30A degrees C also existed before stomata started to close. Generally, the differences in gas exchange between both stands were small, which led to the conclusion that micro-climatic constraints to E and photosynthesis were not the major factors for declining tree density with increasing distance from the river.

AB In freshwater ecosystems, species compositions are known to be determined hierarchically by large to small-scale environmental factors, based on the biological traits of the organisms. However, in ephemeral habitats this heuristic framework remains largely untested. Although temporary wetland faunas are constrained by a local filter (i.e., desiccation), we propose its magnitude may still depend on large-scale climate characteristics. If this is true, climate should be related to the degree of functional and taxonomic relatedness of invertebrate communities inhabiting seasonal wetlands. We tested this hypothesis in two ways. First, based on 52 biological traits for invertebrates, we conducted a case study to explore functional trends among temperate seasonal wetlands differing in the harshness (i.e., dryness) of their dry season. After finding evidence of trait filtering, we addressed whether it could be generalized across a broader climatic scale. To this end, a meta-analysis (225 seasonal wetlands spread across broad climatic categories: Arid, Temperate, and Cold) allowed us to identify whether an equivalent climate-dependent pattern of trait richness was consistent between the Nearctic and the Western Palearctic. Functional overlap of invertebrates increased from mild (i.e., Temperate) to harsher climates (i.e., Arid and Cold), and phylogenetic clustering (using taxonomy as a surrogate) was highest in Arid and lowest in Temperate wetlands. We show that, (i) as has been described in streams, higher relatedness than would be expected by chance is generally observed in seasonal wetland invertebrate communities; and (ii) this relatedness is not constant but climate-dependent, with the climate under which a given seasonal wetland is located determining the functional overlap and the phylogenetic clustering of the community. Finally, using a space-for-time substitution approach we suggest our results may anticipate how the invertebrate biodiversity embedded in these vulnerable and often overlooked ecosystems will be affected by long-term climate change.

AB Biodiversity has reached a critical state. In this context, stakeholders need indicators that both provide a synthetic view of the state of biodiversity and can be used as communication tools. Using river fishes as model, we developed community indicators that aim at integrating various components of biodiversity including interactions between species and ultimately the processes influencing ecosystem functions. We developed indices at the species level based on (i) the concept of specialization directly linked to the niche theory and (ii) the concept of originality measuring the overall degree of differences between a species and all other species in the same clade. Five major types of originality indices, based on phylogeny, habitat-linked and diet-linked morphology, life history traits, and ecological niche were analyzed. In a second step, we tested the relationship between all biodiversity indices and land use as a proxy of human pressures. Fish communities showed no significant temporal trend for most of these indices, but both originality indices based on diet-and habitat-linked morphology showed a significant increase through time. From a spatial point of view, all indices clearly singled out Corsica Island as having higher average originality and specialization. Finally, we observed that the originality index based on niche traits might be used as an informative biodiversity indicator because we showed it is sensitive to different land use classes along a landscape artificialization gradient. Moreover, its response remained unchanged over two other land use classifications at the global scale and also at the regional scale.

AB To date, approaches in environmental risk assessment (ERA) are based on taxonomy-based descriptions of ecosystems. Due to the widespread occurrence of numerous types of chemicals in the environment and ensuing environmental risks, there is a need to get insight in the relationship between the response of the ecosystem to pollution and the characteristics (traits) of the organisms. The main hypothesis of the present research is that the trait composition of macroinvertebrate communities changes in a consistent manner along general environmental disturbance gradients. In this study, the relationship between maximal body length of macroinvertebrates and environmental variables (e.g. Cu concentration) reflecting river sediment quality in Flanders (Belgium) was analysed. It was found that the abundance at almost all body lengths decreased with a decreasing quality of the river sediment, which could be associated with a decrease in abundance of macroinvertebrate taxa. It was also observed that the number of different body lengths decreased with increasing pollution, which can be linked to a decrease in diversity of the macroinvertebrate community. At low levels of general environmental pollution especially small taxa (<20 mm) experienced negative effects, but with increasing pollution also the abundance of larger taxa (>60 mm) decreased. The trend observed for general environmental pollution was further analysed for specific types of metal contamination. Basic and zero-inflated Poisson models showed that with increasing copper pollution, the abundance of larger taxa quickly decreased and only relatively small taxa remained abundant. However, the observed trend was not generally applicable for all contaminants. The results of this research indicate that by using only individual metal concentrations it is not possible to explain the shifts in size distribution of macroinvertebrates. Including other environmental characteristics and other traits could enhance the understanding of how the macroinvertebrate community composition responds to environmental disturbances.

AB Organic aggregates provide a favorable habitat for aquatic microbes, are efficiently filtered by shellfish, and may play a major role in the dynamics of aquatic pathogens. Quantifying this role requires understanding how pathogen abundance in the water and aggregate size interact to determine the presence and abundance of pathogen cells on individual aggregates. We build upon current understanding of the dynamics of bacteria and bacterial grazers on aggregates to develop a model for the dynamics of a bacterial pathogen species. The model accounts for the importance of stochasticity and the balance between colonization and extinction. Simulation results suggest that while colonization increases linearly with background density and aggregate size, extinction rates are expected to be nonlinear on small aggregates in a low background density of the pathogen. Under these conditions, we predict lower probabilities of pathogen presence and reduced abundance on aggregates compared with predictions based solely on colonization. These results suggest that the importance of aggregates to the dynamics of aquatic bacterial pathogens may be dependent on the interaction between aggregate size and background pathogen density, and that these interactions are strongly influenced by ecological interactions and pathogen traits. The model provides testable predictions and can be a useful tool for exploring how species-specific differences in pathogen traits may alter the effect of aggregates on disease transmission.

AB Macrofauna community interactions with environmental variables in the water column (salinity, temperature, turbidity, transparency, suspended particulate matter, particulate organic matter, chol-oroplastic pigments) and in the sediment (granulometric variables, organic carbon and pigments) were investigated in a coastal area with high land runoff due to riverine and temporary stream discharges (Greece, Aegean Sea, Maliakos Gulf). Samples were taken along a distance-depositional gradient from the river mouth to the open sea at eight stations, at times of different precipitation regime from August 2000 to May 2001. The physical variables, such as transparency and median grain size, generally increased seawards, and parallelled the depositional gradient as opposed to measures of food inputs and hydrodynamic regime. High environmental heterogeneity was observed during peak precipitation. The total number of species increased seawards and from August (122 species) to May (170 species). Maximum abundance also increased from August (4953 m(-2)) to May (10,220 individuals m-2), irrespective of distance from river mouth. Species belonging to different functional groups, as to recolonization, feeding, motility and substrate preferences, coexisted at all times indicating high functional diversity. Nonparametric multivariate regression showed that at times of low, rising and falling precipitation 78 -81% of community variation was explained by environmental variables, indicating that macrofauna distribution and species composition respond to food inputs and sediment characteristics. During peak land runoff the community environment relationship weakened (57% of the variability explained). The diversity of functional traits of the most abundant species indicates that the macrofauna community can absorb the impact of increased turbidity, sedimentation and current-driven dispersion. The study offers baseline information for the integrated coastal zone management in microtidal areas with high land runoff under Mediterranean-type climate conditions. During peak land runoff the community environment relationship weakened (57% of the variability explained) whilst species distribution ranges increased. The study shows that the functional diversity in the study area prior to high discharge period enable macrofauna community to absorb the impact of increased turbidity, sedimentation and current-driven dispersion. The study offers baseline information for the impact of high land runoff in microtidal areas under Mediterranean-type climate conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fine-scale population structure has been widely described for salmonid populations using neutral genetic markers, but whether that structure reflects adaptive differences among the populations remains of interest to evolutionary biologists and conservation managers alike. The use of transcriptomics to quantify population differences in genetically controlled functional gene expression traits holds promise for investigating this divergence associated with possible local adaptation. We use custom microarrays to characterize population divergence in transcription at functionally relevant (metabolic and immune function) genes among tributary populations of rainbow trout from Babine Lake, BC and compare it to neutral divergence estimated from microsatellite markers. Transcriptional divergence (P-ST) was determined at resting state and in response to metabolic and immune challenges, two major sources of mortality and thus selective forces on juvenile salmonids. Results indicate that the majority of selected genes [56 genes (65%), 64 genes (63%) and 38 genes (78%) under control, temperature and immune challenges respectively] show transcriptional divergence (P-ST>F-ST) that is consistent with the action of divergent selection. Patterns of pairwise P-ST among populations are inconsistent with evolution by drift. In general, it appears that the magnitude and pattern of population divergence in transcription reflect the action of natural selection and identify selection on transcription as a mechanism for local adaptation. These results reinforce the need to conserve salmonids on a tributary basis and provide insight into genetic mechanisms that facilitate local adaptation.

AB Ecosystems are fragmented by natural and anthropogenic processes that affect organism movement and ecosystem dynamics. When a fragmentation restricts predator but not prey movement, then the prey produced on one side of an ecosystem edge can subsidize predators on the other side. When prey flux is high, predator density on the receiving side increases above that possible by in situ prey productivity, and when low, the formerly subsidized predators can impose strong top-down control of in situ prey-in situ prey experience apparent competition from the subsidy. If predators feed on some evolutionary clades of in situ prey over others, then subsidy-derived apparent competition will induce phylogenetic structure in prey composition. Dams fragment the serial nature of river ecosystems by prohibiting movement of organisms and restricting flowing water. In the river tailwater just below a large central Mexican dam, fish density was high and fish gorged on reservoir-derived zooplankton. When the dam was closed, water flow and the zooplankton subsidy ceased, densely packed pools of fish formed, fish switched to feed on in situ prey, and the tailwater macroinvertebrate community was phylogenetic structured. We derived expectations of structure from trait-based community assembly models based on macroinvertebrate body size, tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance, and fish-diet selectivity. The diet-selectivity model best fit the observed tailwater phylogenetic structure. Thus, apparent competition from subsidies phylogenetically structures prey communities, and serial variation in phylogenetic community structure can be indicative of fragmentation in formerly continuous ecosystems.

AB Floodplain waterbodies and their biodiversity are increasingly threatened by human activities. Given the limited resources available to protect them, methods to identify the most valuable areas for biodiversity conservation are urgently needed. In this study, we used freshwater fish assemblages in floodplain waterbodies to propose an innovative method for selecting priority areas based on four aspects of their diversity: taxonomic (i.e. according to species classification), functional (i.e. relationship between species and ecosystem processes), natural heritage (i.e. species threat level), and socio-economic (i.e. species interest to anglers and fishermen) diversity. To quantitatively evaluate those aspects, we selected nine indices derived either from metrics computed at the species level and then combined for each assemblage (species rarity, origin, biodiversity conservation concern, functional uniqueness, functional originality, fishing interest), or from metrics directly computed at the assemblage level (species richness, assemblage rarity, diversity of biological traits). Each of these indices belongs to one of the four aspects of diversity. A synthetic index defined as the sum of the standardized aspects of diversity was used to assess the multi-faceted diversity of fish assemblages. We also investigated whether the two main environmental gradients at the catchment (distance from the sea) and at the floodplain (lateral connectivity of the waterbodies) scales influenced the diversity of fish assemblages, and consequently their potential conservation value. Finally, we propose that the floodplain waterbodies that should be conserved as a priority are those located in the downstream part of the catchment and which have a substantial lateral connectivity with the main channel.

AB This study outlines an alternative, versatile and flexible procedure to the Assessment System for the Ecological Quality of Streams and Rivers throughout Europe using Benthic Macroinvertebrates (AQEM) protocol for selecting and assessing candidate bioindicators for Water Framework Directive (WFD) compliant monitoring programmes. Based on different forms of benthic macroinvertebrate data using relative abundance of family level taxonomic groups, metrics and traits collected during spring 2010 at 96 lotic sites across northern Portugal, the procedure employs components of top down and bottom up analytical processes and introduces the concept of niche breadth to assess biological quality element response to environmental and stressor parameters across different spatial levels. Random Forest classification revealed that fractal and non-fractal land use metrics at basin and local level were extremely important determinants of Water Framework Directive determination of "Good" ecological quality, particularly at the local scale. The amount of urbanization at the lower spatial level was a particularly important determinant of ecological quality, while the extent and type of forest (especially coniferous) was more important at higher, river basin scale. Distance-based linear models (DISTLM) and distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) were used to determine associations between invertebrate data and non-redundant environmental predictors selected using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Results revealed a stronger association between invertebrate traits and selected environmental predictors compared to the other types of invertebrate data, although some association between invertebrate relative abundance and eutrophication was detected. Principal Components Analyses (PCA) were run for the non-redundant sets of predictors for each macroinvertebrate data set to extract an environmental quality gradient along the first axis. Niche breadth, calculated for candidate indicators to avoid bias resulting from expert judgement, was distributed by rank along its respective PCA gradient. Five candidate indicators for each data type were selected for their preference for the most pristine sites and five were selected due to their close link with the most degraded streams. Candidate bioindicators for impacted sites tended to be stenobiotic in character, due to the impoverished structural and functional diversity associated with such conditions. Finally Partial Least Squares Regression was used to refine and validate selected candidate metrics, to produce a comprehensive final list of macroinvertebrate measures of ecological quality.

AB Estuarine and coastal ecosystems are productive and functionally diverse areas that provide a wide range of societal benefits. Along with human exploitative uses comes an array of anthropogenic disturbances that can affect ecological integrity, including changes to the composition and resilience of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. To understand the responses of ecological communities to anthropogenic disturbance and to manage and mitigate effects, indices for assessing the ecological integrity of estuarine and coastal waters have proliferated worldwide. Using data from 84 intertidal sites in Auckland, New Zealand, we evaluated the suitability of two widely used measures of ecological integrity that were developed in USA and Europe, respectively: the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) and the AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). We then developed a local index based on macrofaunal traits and verified its utility using independent data from >100 additional sites. The local traits based index (TBI), constructed from the richness of macrofaunal taxa in seven functional groups, responded to changes in sediment mud percentage and heavy metal contaminant concentration gradients below international guidelines. The TBI performed better than the indices developed overseas, probably because they were designed to track organic enrichment and hypoxia, which are not the predominant stressors in New Zealand at present. The TBI successfully tracked the stressors that were the most relevant locally and indicated the relative levels of within-group taxonomic richness at various sites. As within-group richness is a component of functional redundancy and ecological resilience, the TBI offers a trifecta of simplicity, robustness and meaningfulness that will facilitate management.

AB Functional diversity, e.g. based on feeding types, is frequently used for assessment procedures. By using Trichoptera genera Potamophylax and Melampophylax as examples, we demonstrate that functional diversity, based on mandible morphology, is low in the former, but high in the latter. When using functional feeding types for assessment procedures, this strictly questions identification at higher than species level and underlines the importance of providing taxonomic information by describing hitherto unknown larvae.
   Based on mandible morphology, the close species pair Potamophylax haidukorum and P. winneguthi, both endemics of the Dinaric Western Balkan, are omnivorous shredders, a character shared with all other known larvae of genus Potamophylax. In existing keys, P. haidukorum and P. winneguthi may be separated from morphologically close species (e.g. Allogamus spp., Micropterna spp., Potamophylax spp., Leptotaulius gracilis Schmid and Parachiona picicornis (Pictet)) by the lack of a large posterior sclerite at the lateral protuberance, by the lack of additional face setae at mid and hind femora, by the absence of numerous black spines at the pronotal surface and by the shape of metanotal sclerites. Melampophylax austriacus, an endemic of the Eastern Alps, has spoon-shaped scraper mandibles lacking teeth. This character is shared with M. mucoreus (Hagen) and M. nepos (McLachlan), whereas in M. melampus (McLachlan) teeth are present at the mandibles as it is common for omnivorous shredders. Such intra-generic functional diversity questions trait classifications on higher taxonomic units like genus or family. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Due to human impact, there is extensive degradation and loss of marine habitats, which calls for measures that incorporate taxonomic as well as functional and trophic aspects of biodiversity. Since such data is less easily quantifiable in nature, the use of habitats as surrogates or proxies for biodiversity is on the rise in marine conservation and management. However, there is a critical gap in knowledge of whether pre-defined habitat units adequately represent the functional and trophic structure of communities. We also lack comparisons of different measures of community structure in terms of both between-(beta) and within-habitat (alpha) variability when accounting for species densities. Thus, we evaluated a priori defined coastal habitats as surrogates for traditional taxonomic, functional and trophic zoobenthic community structure. We focused on four habitats (bare sand, canopy-forming algae, seagrass above-and belowground), all easily delineated in nature and defined through classification systems. We analyzed uni- and multivariate data on species and trait diversity as well as stable isotope ratios of benthic macrofauna. A good fit between habitat types and taxonomic and functional structure was found, although habitats were more similar functionally. This was attributed to within-habitat heterogeneity so when habitat divisions matched the taxonomic structure, only bare sand was functionally distinct. The pre-defined habitats did not meet the variability of trophic structure, which also proved to differentiate on a smaller spatial scale. The quantification of trophic structure using species density only identified an epi- and an infaunal unit. To summarize the results we present a conceptual model illustrating the match between pre-defined habitat types and the taxonomic, functional and trophic community structure. Our results show the importance of including functional and trophic aspects more comprehensively in marine management and spatial planning.

AB The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) seeks to achieve good environmental status, by 2020, for European seas. This study analyses the applicability of a process-driven benthic sedimentary habitat model, to be used in the implementation of the MSFD in relation to biodiversity and seafloor integrity descriptors for sedimentary habitats. Our approach maps the major environmental factors influencing soft-bottom macrobenthic community structure and the life-history traits of species. Among the 16 environmental variables considered, a combination of water depth, mean grain size, a wave-induced sediment resuspension index and annual bottom maximum temperature, are the most significant factors explaining the variability in the structure of benthic communities in the study area. These variables are classified into those representing the 'Disturbance' and 'Scope for Growth' components of the environment. It was observed that the habitat classes defined in the process-driven model reflected different structural and functional characteristics of the benthos. Moreover, benthic community structure anomalies due to human pressures could also be detected within the model produced. Thus, the final process-driven habitat map can be considered as being highly useful for seafloor integrity and biodiversity assessment, within the European MSFD as well as for conservation, environmental status assessment and managing human activities, especially within the marine spatial planning process.

AB Dam construction has large negative effects on biodiversity in river and riparian ecosystems worldwide. This study aimed to determine whether reservoir shorelines had lower plant species diversity and functional diversity than unregulated or lightly regulated riparian wetlands and to examine the responses of plant diversity and functional traits to reservoir shoreline environmental gradients. We surveyed 146, 44, and 67 plots on reservoir shorelines and in mainstem and tributary riparian wetlands, respectively, in a subtropical river-reservoir system. Species richness, functional richness, evenness, and divergence were calculated to reflect the species and functional diversity of plant communities. Environmental factors including elevation above water level, slope, landform type, substrate, disturbance, and cover were measured. The results showed that both species and functional richness were significantly lower on reservoir shorelines than in riparian wetlands. The relative species number of clonal plants and relative cover of annual plants were both negatively related to slope and elevation. Structural equation modeling and other statistical analyses indicated that most environmental factors had significant effects on species and functional richness on reservoir shorelines but had no significant effect on functional evenness and divergence. Our findings suggest that reservoir shoreline wetlands formed by damming rivers and inundating pre-existing riparian wetlands can be a biodiversity coldspot in regulated rivers at the plot level. Topographic factors are important in determining the plant diversity and vegetation establishment on reservoir shorelines in the Yangtze River basin.

AB We hypothesised and tested a hierarchical organisation model where riparian landcover would influence bank composition and light availability, which in turn would influence instream environments and control fish assemblages. The study was conducted during the dry season in 11 headwater tributaries of the Sorocaba River in the upper Parana River Basin, south-eastern Brazil. We focused on seven environmental factors each represented by one or multiple environmental variables and seven fish functional traits each represented by two or more classes. Multivariate direct gradient analyses suggested that riparian zone landcover can be considered a higher level causal factor in a network of relations that control instream characteristics and fish assemblages. Our results provide a framework for a hierarchical conceptual model that identifies singular and collective influences of variables from different scales on each other and ultimately on different aspects related to stream fish functional composition. This conceptual model is focused on the relationships between riparian landcover and instream variables as causal factors on the organisation of stream fish assemblages. Our results can also be viewed as a model for headwater stream management in that landcover can be manipulated to influence factors such as bank composition, substrates and water quality, whereas fish assemblage composition can be used as indicators to monitor the success of such efforts.

AB The presence of different kinds of leaf packs (native or alien) and environmental gradients can affect the composition and abundance of macroinvertebrate assemblages in freshwater ecosystems, but little is known about the interactive effects. Here, we investigated (1) how environmental gradients could influence leaf packs macroinvertebrates and (2) which was the chief factor (among water quality, mass loss of leaf packs, and flow regime) affecting macroinvertebrate assemblages in impaired streams. We analyzed leaf packs in six sites in impaired streams, characterized by wastewater discharges and dominated by pollution-tolerant macroinvertebrate species. Using principal component analysis, we defined two environmental gradients as follows: a water quality gradient, related to anthropogenic alteration, and a hydromorphological gradient, mostly related to the catchment features. Our results pointed out that, in the tested conditions, biological metrics, such as functional groups and taxa richness, were chiefly influenced by the water quality gradient, while different leaf types in packs influenced the total taxa richness, but did not cause significant variation in the distribution and abundance of macroinvertebrate functional groups. On the contrary, the mass loss differed for different leaf types and was related to the stream and catchment features (mainly flow). This work showed that, in impaired streams, macroinvertebrate assemblages colonizing leaf packs are more influenced by water quality than by leaf types. Thus, the improvement of water quality should be the priority in restoration programs and should be achieved before any effort to restore native riparian vegetation.

AB Habitat-associated trait divergence may vary across ontogeny if there are strong size-related shifts in selection pressures. We quantified patterns of phenotypic divergence in Nile perch (Lates niloticus) from ecologically distinct wetland edge and forest edge habitats in Lake Nabugabo, Uganda, and we compared patterns of divergence across three size classes to determine whether trends are consistent through Nile perch ontogeny. We predicted that inter-habitat variation in biotic (e.g. vegetation structure) and abiotic (e.g. dissolved oxygen concentration) variables may create divergent selective regimes. We compared body morphology using geometric morphometrics and found substantial differences between habitats, although not all trends were consistent across size classes. The most striking aspects of divergence in small Nile perch were in mouth orientation, head size, and development of the caudal region. Medium-sized Nile perch also showed differences in mouth orientation. Differences in large individuals were related to eye size and orientation, as well as caudal length. The observed patterns of divergence are consistent with functional morphological predictions for fish across divergent trophic regimes, high and low predation environments, and complex and simple habitats. Although this suggests adaptive divergence, the source of phenotypic variation is unknown and may reflect phenotypic plasticity and/or genetic differences.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 449-465.

AB Bioturbation, the biogenic modification of sediments through particle reworking and burrow ventilation, is a key mediator of many important geochemical processes in marine systems. In situ quantification of bioturbation can be achieved in a myriad of ways, requiring expert knowledge, technology, and resources not always available, and not feasible in some settings. Where dedicated research programmes do not exist, a practical alternative is the adoption of a trait-based approach to estimate community bioturbation potential (BPc). This index can be calculated from inventories of species, abundance and biomass data (routinely available for many systems), and a functional classification of organism traits associated with sediment mixing (less available). Presently, however, there is no agreed standard categorization for the reworking mode and mobility of benthic species. Based on information from the literature and expert opinion, we provide a functional classification for 1033 benthic invertebrate species from the northwest European continental shelf, as a tool to enable the standardized calculation of BPc in the region. Future uses of this classification table will increase the comparability and utility of large-scale assessments of ecosystem processes and functioning influenced by bioturbation (e.g., to support legislation). The key strengths, assumptions, and limitations of BPc as a metric are critically reviewed, offering guidelines for its calculation and application.

AB Riparian ecosystems support mosaics of terrestrial and aquatic plant species that enhance regional biodiversity and provide important ecosystem services to humans. Species composition and the distribution of functional traits - traits that define species in terms of their ecological roles - within riparian plant communities are rapidly changing in response to various global change drivers. Here, we present a conceptual framework illustrating how changes in dependent wildlife communities and ecosystem processes can be predicted by examining shifts in riparian plant functional trait diversity and redundancy (overlap). Three widespread examples of altered riparian plant composition are: shifts in the dominance of deciduous and coniferous species; increases in drought-tolerant species; and the increasing global distribution of plantation and crop species. Changes in the diversity and distribution of critical plant functional traits influence terrestrial and aquatic food webs, organic matter production and processing, nutrient cycling, water quality, and water availability. Effective conservation efforts and riparian ecosystems management require matching of plant functional trait diversity and redundancy with tolerance to environmental changes in all biomes.

AB Reduction of flow constitutes one of the most severe human alterations to rivers, as it affects the key abiotic feature of these ecosystems. While there has been considerable progress in understanding the effects of reduced flow on benthic macroinvertebrates, cascading effects of flow reduction on dissolved oxygen concentrations (DO) have not yet received much attention. We compared the macroinvertebrate composition between reference conditions and a situation after several years of discharge reduction in the Spree River (Brandenburg, Germany). Community composition shifted from rheophilic species to species indifferent to flow conditions. Filter feeders were partially replaced by collector/gatherers, which likely reduces the retention of organic matter, and thus the self-purification capacity of the river section. These shifts were associated with low discharge during summer, cascading into daily DO concentration minima of less than 5 mg l(-1) which prevailed 74% of the days in summer. This depletion of DO after flow reduction presumably caused the observed species turnover. Hence, flow reduction in lowland rivers may not only directly impair the ecological functions provided by benthic macroinvertebrates but may also act indirectly by depleting DO concentrations.

AB Astroblepidae or climbing catfishes encompass a single genus of species living in high altitude rivers in the Andes of South America. They are characterized by a specialized head morphology closely resembling their better known, widely radiated sister family Loricariidae, or armored suckermouth catfishes. Existent data show that even though both families share important traits, there are some striking differences as well. Albeit poorly known, Astroblepus species possess a duplicated gill opening, and have the ability to climb vertical rocks or waterfalls. In this study, morphological and kinematic data are combined to yield insights into the functions of the mobile elements of the astroblepid head, and to compare head morphology and biomechanics with those of Loricariidae. We found that, even though there is substantial similarity in head structure of both families, there are major differences in functionally important structures. These include a different lower lip muscle configuration, an alternative oral valve system, and an incurrent gill opening only found in astroblepids. Kinematic analyses confirm that the astroblepid suckermouth, freed from its inhalatory function, offers advantages for climbing in the high-altitude environment, and is used alternately with the extremely mobile pelvic girdle, in a crawling, nonundulatory motion.

AB Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) is a method for addressing ecological functioning based on traits exhibited by members of biological assemblages. This study explores and compares species and biological trait patterns on either side (landward and seaward) of coastal breakwater structures in northwestern Adriatic Sea (Italy), with the aim of giving insights and knowledge for management of sandy beach systems affected by coastal development. Eight ecological traits of 96 benthic species were considered. Taxon composition evidenced differences in benthic assemblages across time and exposure: landward and seaward communities shared less than 50% of the total number of species. BTA suggested a no-management effect in the functioning of benthic assemblages. Dominant traits modalities were deposit-feeding, short life, small body size, short life span, iteroparity, gonocorism, with plankto-planktotrophic larvae. The results of BTA highlighted similarities and stability in trait composition contrary to species composition, suggesting a possible persistence in benthic functioning despite the occurrence of species replacements. To best of my knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts to investigate the effects of a management measure (submerged shore-parallel barriers with groynes) in a shallow marine system by means of BTA.

AB The full accomplishment of the European Water Framework Directive objectives has required from EU members three successive steps: (i) the evaluation of their water body ecological status, (ii) the risk assessment of different anthropogenic pressure categories and (iii) the implementation of appropriate management and restoration programs.
   We aimed at designing an innovative retrospective ecological risk assessment (ERA) tool working for most of the French wadeable rivers in a context of multiple anthropogenic pressures (step ii). This tool, including conditional tree forest (CTF) models, was built on combinations of benthic macroinvertebrate trait-based metrics for each of sixteen anthropogenic pressure categories.
   For eleven pressure categories, CTF models have given good impairment risk assessment (i.e. AUC >= 0.70), even at moderate risk level and in a multi-pressure context. The four other models have provided poorer but promising results (AUC = 0.67 +/- 0.02).
   Identifying the potential weight of individual anthropogenic pressures that lead to biotic assemblage impairment in streams under multiple pressure scenario, is a key step for managers to implement appropriate stream restoration programs. Simultaneously considering the whole complexity of bio-ecological adaptations within biotic assemblages subjected to human pressures provides a functional diagnostic tool both (i) ecologically relevant and (ii) efficient for ERA.

AB A morphofunctional traits approach has been adopted to identify how environmental factors shape the phytoplankton community. This approach has been applied in two rivers where hydrodynamical conditions are expected to be the main factor acting on the phytoplankton community. Hence, morphological traits (motility, shape, size, mucilage, and silica) related to sedimentation resistance have been chosen. We have shown that differences in flow regulation through differences in flow velocities induce shifts in phytoplankton community. These shifts depend mostly on shape, buoyancy regulation, and motility of phytoplankton cells. Elongated shapes are the characteristic of unregulated sites with high flow velocities, while cells able to regulate actively their position or to reduce their density (mucilaginous colonies) are found in regulated sites with low flow velocities. Flattened shapes are also the characteristic of sites with rather low flow velocities. These results highlight the key role of flow velocity as a driving factor controlling the structure of phytoplankton community. In this study, flow velocity also structures phytoplankton community according to location rather than seasonality.

AB 1. Understanding the functional significance of species interactions in ecosystems has become a major challenge as biodiversity declines rapidly worldwide. Ecosystem consequences arising from the loss of diversity either within trophic levels (horizontal diversity) or across trophic levels (vertical diversity) are well documented. However, simultaneous losses of species at different trophic levels may also result in interactive effects, with potentially complex outcomes for ecosystem functioning.
   2. Because of logistical constraints, the outcomes of such interactions have been difficult to assess in experiments involving large metazoan species. Here, we take advantage of a detritus-based model system to experimentally assess the consequences of biodiversity change within both horizontal and vertical food-web components on leaf-litter decomposition, a fundamental process in a wide range of ecosystems.
   3. Our concurrent manipulation of fungal decomposer diversity (0, 1 or 5 species), detritivore diversity (0, 1 or 3 species), and the presence of predatory fish scent showed that trophic complexity is key to eliciting diversity effects on ecosystem functioning. Specifically, although fungi and detritivores tended to promote decomposition individually, rates were highest in the most complete community where all trophic levels were represented at the highest possible species richness. In part, the effects were trait-mediated, reflected in the contrasting foraging responses of the detritivore species to predator scent.
   4. Our results thus highlight the importance of interactive effects of simultaneous species loss within multiple trophic levels on ecosystem functioning. If a common phenomenon, this outcome suggests that functional ecosystem impairment resulting from widespread biodiversity loss could be more severe than inferred from previous experiments confined to varying diversity within single trophic levels.

AB Taxonomic sufficiency (TS) has been proposed for assessing community composition and environmental impacts as a way to balance the need to indicate the biology of the organisms present with time and effort needed for species identification. TS has been applied most often to marine and freshwater macroinvertebrates, but tests of its usefulness are lacking for other freshwater groups. We analyzed the effects of taxonomic resolution, functional groupings, and data transformation on multivariate community patterns in periphyton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, and fishes, and on the quantification of biodiversity and environmental gradients. The applicability of TS differed strongly among taxonomic groups, depending on the average taxonomic breadth of the species sets. Numerical data resolution had more pronounced effects on community patterns than taxonomic resolution. Richness was strongly affected by data aggregation, but diversity indices were statistically reliable up to order level. Taxonomic aggregation had no significant influence on ability to detect environmental gradients. Functional surrogates based on biological traits, such as feeding type, reproductive strategy, and trophic state, were strongly correlated (r = 0.64-0.85) with taxonomic community composition. However, environmental correlations were generally lower with data aggregated to functional traits rather than to species. TS was universally applicable within taxonomic groups for different habitats in one biogeographic region. Aggregation to family or order was suitable for quantifying biodiversity and environmental gradients, but multivariate community analyses required finer resolution in fishes and macrophytes than in periphyton and macroinvertebrates. Sampling effort in environmental-impact studies and monitoring programs would be better invested in quantitative data and number of spatial and temporal replicates than in taxonomic detail.

AB 1. The biogeography of freshwater fish is determined in part by large-scale filters such as phylogenetic history, the spatial arrangement of catchments and environmental variability. Species are filtered from the regional pool if they possess a combination of functional traits enabling them to persist in the local environment. This article aims to quantify the relative importance of these large-scale filters in determining spatial variation in freshwater fish life-history traits and functional trait composition of Australian river basins.
   2. We developed a database of 10 life-history traits for 141 native freshwater fish species and compiled species distribution data for 123 river basins across the Australian continent. In order to partition the variation in the representation of life-history trait into unique and overlapping components, we also quantified the degree of phylogenetic relatedness among species, the geographical arrangement of river basins throughout the landscape and 12 broad-scale environmental factors. We then related life-history trait composition to gradients of environmental variation by constrained multivariate ordination and simple linear regression.
   3. Our explanatory matrices accounted for 86.8% of the total variation in life-history trait composition at the river basin scale, of which 59.4% could be attributed to phylogeny and spatially structured environmental variation. This component represents the overlap among the broad-scale filtering processes of phylogenetic history, spatial autocorrelation and environmental variability in accounting for the distribution of life-history traits across Australian river basins.
   4. Our analysis showed strong associations between suites of life-history traits that define generation time and reproductive output and a strong climate-hydrological gradient across the landscape. We also showed significant correlations between specific environmental variables and a number of key life-history traits that highlight the importance of trait-mediated environmental filters at broad spatial scales.
   5. This study advances our conceptual understanding of broad-scale community assembly theory and has revealed trait-environment relationships at scales relevant to restoration and conservation of aquatic biodiversity. Our study provides greater insight into the determinants of spatial variation in fish species distributions and potentially addresses key scientific challenges, such as understanding how fish communities are assembled, and identifies the potential threats to, and responses of, these communities caused by environmental change.

AB Background: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), a marine mammal species inhabited in the waters of Southeast Asia, South Africa and Australia, has attracted much attention because of the dramatic decline in population size in the past decades, which raises the concern of extinction. So far, this species is poorly characterized at molecular level due to little sequence information available in public databases. Recent advances in large-scale RNA sequencing provide an efficient approach to generate abundant sequences for functional genomic analyses in the species with un-sequenced genomes.
   Principal Findings: We performed a de novo assembly of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin leucocyte transcriptome by Illumina sequencing. 108,751 high quality sequences from 47,840,388 paired-end reads were generated, and 48,868 and 46,587 unigenes were functionally annotated by BLAST search against the NCBI non-redundant and Swiss-Prot protein databases (E-value<10(-5)), respectively. In total, 16,467 unigenes were clustered into 25 functional categories by searching against the COG database, and BLAST2GO search assigned 37,976 unigenes to 61 GO terms. In addition, 36,345 unigenes were grouped into 258 KEGG pathways. We also identified 9,906 simple sequence repeats and 3,681 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms as potential molecular markers in our assembled sequences. A large number of unigenes were predicted to be involved in immune response, and many genes were predicted to be relevant to adaptive evolution and cetacean-specific traits.
   Conclusion: This study represented the first transcriptome analysis of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, an endangered species. The de novo transcriptome analysis of the unique transcripts will provide valuable sequence information for discovery of new genes, characterization of gene expression, investigation of various pathways and adaptive evolution, as well as identification of genetic markers.

AB In ecology and evolution, the primary challenge in understanding the processes that shape biodiversity is to assess the relationship between the phenotypic traits of organisms and the environment. Here we tested for selection on physio-morphological traits measured by scanning flow-cytometry at the individual level in phytoplankton communities under a temporally changing biotic and abiotic environment. Our aim was to study how high-frequency temporal changes in the environment influence biodiversity dynamics in a natural community. We focused on a spring bloom in Lake Zurich (Switzerland), characterized by rapid changes in phytoplankton, water conditions, nutrients and grazing (mainly mediated by herbivore ciliates). We described bloom dynamics in terms of taxonomic and trait-based diversity and found that diversity dynamics of trait-based groups were more pronounced than those of identified phytoplankton taxa. We characterized the linkage between measured phytoplankton traits, abiotic environmental factors and abundance of the main grazers and observed weak but significant correlations between changing abiotic and biotic conditions and measured size-related and fluorescence-related traits. We tested for deviations in observed community-wide distributions of focal traits from random patterns and found evidence for both clustering and even spacing of traits, occurring sporadically over the time series. Patterns were consistent with environmental filtering and phenotypic divergence under herbivore pressure, respectively. Size-related traits showed significant even spacing during the peak of herbivore abundance, suggesting that morphology-related traits were under selection from grazing. Pigment distribution within cells and colonies appeared instead to be associated with acclimation to temperature and water chemistry. We found support for trade-offs among grazing resistance and environmental tolerance traits, as well as for substantial periods of dynamics in which our measured traits were not under selection.

AB Previous research on the combined action of various paired agricultural stressors in stream ecosystems has shown that non-additive outcomes (i.e. synergisms or antagonisms) are more common than simple additive effects on communities, but the interplay between deposited fine sediment and widely used herbicides such as glyphosate as stressors is not well understood. A 28-day experiment in outdoor stream mesocosms simulated effects of varying levels of fine sediment and a glyphosate-based herbicide on macroinvertebrates and ecosystem function (leaf breakdown) in a fully factorial repeated-measures design. Our aim was to determine whether (i) increased levels of sediment and glyphosate had individual and/or additive combined effects on invertebrates and leaf breakdown, (ii) increased sediment reduced the toxicity of glyphosate (antagonistic multiple stressor interaction) or (iii) sediment-adsorbed glyphosate prolonged the effects of exposure (synergistic interaction). Sediment addition positively or negatively affected eight of the 10 most common invertebrate taxa colonising the mesocosms and increased or decreased the representation of 12 of 15 biological trait categories possessed by the invertebrates, while glyphosate addition negatively affected only two taxa and two invertebrate trait categories, indicating that glyphosate entering streams as a result of herbicide addition to farmland is less likely to be problematic for invertebrates than fine sediment from catchment erosion. No significant overall sediment-by-glyphosate interaction was detected for invertebrate taxonomic or trait compositions or for any common individual taxon, trait or community metric, indicating that the two stressors were acting additively (i.e. without interaction), rather than synergistically or antagonistically. Leaf breakdown rates (measured as mass and strength loss) were accelerated by sediment and glyphosate as individual stressors. Further, the two stressors interacted for leaf strength loss, with their combined effect being less than additive when both stressors were at their highest levels. Population, community and ecosystem variables responded differently to multiple stressors, highlighting the value of combining structural, functional taxonomic and trait data to assess the effects of anthropogenic stressors.

AB 1. Plants recognize their kin and respond to growing with relatives with changes in functional traits. Here, we integrate competition and evolutionary theory to evaluate these changes.
   2. We draw parallels between the definitions and empirical measurement of competitive effect and competitive response from competition theory, and the costs and benefits of altruistic and selfish behaviours from kin selection theory.
   3. Do plants compete less with relatives, as these parallels suggest? While functional traits respond to the presence of relatives or strangers, no study has directly demonstrated that plants are less competitive with siblings.
   4. However, there are empirical challenges in identifying the competitive value of traits that are measured destructively, such as root allocation.
   5. If these challenges can be addressed, kin recognition responses can offer new insights into plant competition.

AB Vascular plants are known to influence the production, transport and oxidation of methane in wetland soils, but these processes are not well understood. Using plants grown in intact peat cores, we compared the influence upon methane emissions of 20 forb and graminoid species from European wetlands. We measured plant-mediated transport of methane (conduit or chimney effect) using a novel agar-sealing technique that prevented methane exchange from the bare soil to the atmosphere.
   The plant-mediated transport (chimney effect) represented between 30% and almost 100% of the total methane flux, with graminoids exhibiting greater internal transport than forbs. In general, plants with less dense root tissues and a relatively larger root volume exhibited a larger chimney effect. Most species (12 out of 20) significantly reduced methane emissions compared to bare soil and only one species, Succisa pratensis, increased them. We suggest that characterising vegetation in terms of plant functional traits and plant processes offers an effective method for estimating methane emissions from wetlands. However, we found no correlation between the magnitude of the chimney effect and the overall influence of different plant species on methane emissions. Besides introducing a useful tool to study plant-mediated transport, this work suggests that characterising vegetation in terms of functional traits could improve estimates of methane emissions from wetlands, which in turn could help in designing mitigation strategies.

AB Many ongoing processes in today's landscapes impact our environment considerably. Thus, it is enormously important to gather information on qualitative characteristics of our landscapes in order to effectively counteract the negative developments. Structural functionality as proxy for the assessment of habitat quality and species patterns has already proven potential to successfully describe ecological values. Completed by the measurement of green infrastructure information for a defined profile of a functional trait, a rapid and rough assessment of the qualitative state of habitats seems feasible. We therefore present in this study (i) an assessment of structural functionality based on the statistical analysis of landscape metrics, (ii) the measurement of green infrastructure and travelling costs for the ecoprofile of a Disturbance Sensitive Species Group (DSG) and (iii) an investigation if functionality and green infrastructure change between different types of landscapes and protection status. In the Lake Neusiedl region we selected 41 landscape samples based on a stratified random process. Based on orthophoto interpretation, we calculated landscape metrics with FRAGSTATS and reduced them to a core set of 13 indices by combining statistical results with literature review. Their relation to main ecological processes determined if the individual metric related positively or negatively with the land cover category and structural functionality was given by the average value of the landscape metrics. Green infrastructure elements were allocated with GUIDOS, whereas the travelling costs to move between them was also considered. Landscape elements of valuable matrix and connecting corridors ranked highest in structural functionality based on the calculated landscape indices but showed large differences between different land use regimes. Correlation and regression analysis confirmed the dependence of green infrastructure elements (corr. r(2) = 0.877) as well as travelling costs (corr. r(2) = 0.669) to functionality values. Protection status of the landscape samples proved to be a determining factor because functionality values as well as green infrastructure differed significantly (both with a p-value < 0.05) with the exception of dissecting corridors, stepping stones and travelling costs. We conclude that one simple guideline for a holistic assessment of structural functionality is hardly reachable but we did set up a comprehensive rule set. Based on a transparent sampling procedure, a qualitative assessment of habitats and landscapes can easily be conducted. The complementary use of an ecoprofile enables the valuation of green infrastructure elements and the identification of major driving forces along with scenario development for sustainable landscape planning.

AB We integrate information on functional diversity (FD) patterns from estuarine intertidal benthic communities from different habitats and along a temporal disturbance gradient, to understand the drivers of species coexistence patterns. Species and traits' biomass levels seemed to be first determined by habitat filtering, selecting those traits better adapted to the biologically challenging estuarine environment. Within that subset of traits and within each habitat, biotic interactions were probably high, as evidenced by high alpha-diversity and community weighted mean differences. The former patterns hold for the disturbance/recovery scenario considered. However, as the estuary recovered, biomass became more distributed among different trait categories, consistent with increases in FD when the seagrass started to increase. Policy towards the restoration of seagrass bed and other biogenic structures, and improving the connectivity within adjacent systems were confirmed and suggested, as this would imply higher FD and potentially higher resilience to disturbance within the estuarine intertidal system.

AB In the course of re-oligotrophication in Lower Lake Constance, Germany, the tall-growing angiosperm Myriophyllum spicatum has been almost replaced by dense and lower-growing charophytes. We hypothesise that Chara globularis negatively affects the performance of M. spicatum due to density competition and nutrient interference. Intra-and interspecific competition was assessed using a response surface experimental design with different densities of both species in mono and mixed stands in an outdoor mesocosm experiment. After 8 weeks, we measured the growth and various functional traits of both species, including stoichiometry, ash-free dry mass and dry-matter content, and for M. spicatum, additionally chlorophyll content, leaf-mass fraction, formation of autofragments, and root/shoot ratio. With increasing density, C. globularis reduced the growth of M. spicatum much more strongly than that of conspecifics. Increasing density of C. globularis led to a lower chlorophyll a to b ratio and lower nitrogen content based on ash-free dry mass in M. spicatum as well as reduced autofragmentation. Established C. globularis meadows can negatively affect tall-growing angiosperms such as M. spicatum when the environmental conditions, such as low phosphorus availability and high water-clarity, are appropriate. These findings have implications for the management of lakes, specifically those where a nuisance growth of tall macrophytes occurs, e.g. in systems where M. spicatum is invasive.

AB Opposing gradients of light and nutrients can create a variety of niche opportunities for lake phytoplankton. Theory predicts that phytoplankton vertical distribution should be associated with these gradients as different taxa maximize resource access, while minimizing competitive interactions using niche partitioning. We examined the relationships between spatial overlap (SO) of four major phytoplankton spectral groups with key biogeochemical and morphometric environmental parameters across 52 north temperate lakes. SO decreased primarily with greater thermal stratification, and where more light was available and nutrient levels lower. When greater SO did occur in highly stratified lakes, taxonomic diversity was favored through increased species evenness, but not richness. Taxonomic richness, on the other hand, increased in lakes with greater light availability, coincident with low SO. Similarly, niche partitioning associated with greater functional diversity in the range of traits present in the communities was detected when SO was low in clear lakes. Overall, our results indicate that the ability of phytoplankton to spatially separate and utilize large portions of the water column is important for augmenting species and functional trait richness related to motility and resource acquisition. However, our study also suggests that community evenness is favored when phytoplankton distributions overlap in deep chlorophyll maxima associated with stratified lakes.

AB We exposed replicated phytoplankton communities confined in semi-permeable membrane-based mesocosms to 0, 0.1, 1 and 10 mu g L-1 triclosan (TCS) and placed them back in their original environment to investigate the occurrence of trans-generational responses at individual, population and community levels. TCS diffused out of mesocosms with a half-life of less than 8 h, so that only the parental generation was directly stressed. At the beginning of the experiment and after 7 days (approximately 2 generations) we analysed responses in the phytoplankton using scanning flow-cytometry. We acquired information on several individually expressed phenotypic traits, such as size, biovolume, pigment fluorescence and packaging, for thousands of individuals per replicated population and derived population and community aggregated traits. We found significant changes in community functioning (increased productivity in terms of biovolume and total fluorescence), with maximal effects at 1 mu g L-1 TCS. We detected significant and dose-dependent responses on population traits, such as changes in abundance for several populations, increased average size and fluorescence of cells, and strong changes in within-population trait mean and variance (suggesting micro-evolutionary effects). We applied the Price equation approach to partition community effects (changes in biovolume or fluorescence) in their physiological and ecological components, and quantified the residual component (including also evolutionary responses). Our results suggested that evolutionary or inheritable phenotypic plasticity responses may represent a significant component of the total observed change following exposure and over relatively small temporal scales.

AB Plant functional traits affect the capacity of herbivores to find, choose, and consume plants. However, in a community composed of different plant species, it is unclear what proportion of herbivory on a focal plant is explained by its own traits and which is explained by the characteristics of the surrounding vegetation (i.e., nonadditive effects). Moreover, nonadditive effects could be positive or negative, and it is not known if they are related to community properties such as diversity. To quantify nonadditive effects, we developed four different additive models based on monoculture herbivory rates or plant traits and combined them with measurements of standing invertebrate herbivore damage along an experimental plant diversity gradient ranging from monocultures to 60-species mixtures. In all four models, positive nonadditive effects were detected, i.e., herbivory levels were higher in polycultures than what was expected from monoculture data, and these effects contributed up to 25% of the observed variance in herbivory. Importantly, the nonadditive effects, which were defined as the deviance of the models' predictions from the observed herbivory, were positively correlated with the communities' plant species richness. Consequently, interspecific interactions appear to have an important impact on the levels of herbivory of a community. Identifying those community properties that capture the effects of these interactions is a next important challenge for our understanding of how the environment interacts with plant traits to drive levels of herbivory.

AB Ecological communities exhibit regular shifts in structure along environmental gradients, but it has proved difficult to dissect the mechanisms by which environmental conditions determine the relative success of species. Functional traits may provide a link between environmental drivers and mechanisms of community membership, but this has not been well tested for phytoplankton, which dominate primary production in many aquatic ecosystems. Here we test whether functional traits of phytoplankton can explain how species respond to gradients of light and phosphorus across U.S. lakes. We find that traits related to light utilization and maximum growth rate can predict species' differential responses to the relative availability of these resources. These results show that laboratory-measured traits are predictive of species' performance under natural conditions, that functional traits provide a mechanistic foundation for community ecology, and that variation in community structure is predictable in spite of the complexity of ecological communities.

AB The loss of species diversity due to habitat fragmentation has been extensively studied. In contrast, the impacts of habitat fragmentation on functional diversity remains relatively poorly understood. We conducted bird functional diversity studies on a set of 41 recently isolated land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. We analysed differences in bird species richness and a recently developed suite of complementary functional diversity indices (FRic, volume of functional space occupied; FEve, evenness of abundance distribution in the functional trait space; FDiv, divergence in the distribution of abundance in the trait volume) across different gradients (island area and isolation). We found no correlations between FRic and FEve or FEve and FDiv, but negative correlations between FRic and FDiv. As predicted, island area accounted for most of the variation in bird species richness, whereas isolation explained most of the variation in species evenness (decreasing species evenness with increasing isolation). Functional diversity appears to be more strongly influenced by habitat filtering as opposed to limiting similarity. More specifically, across all islands, both FRic and FEve were significantly lower than expected for randomly assembled communities, but FDiv showed no clear patterns. FRic increased with island area, FEve decreased with island area and FDiv showed no clear patterns. Our finding that FEve decreases with island area at TIL may indicate low functional stability on such islands, and as such large islands and habitat patches may deserve extra attention and/or protection. These results help to demonstrate the importance of considering the effects of fragmentation on functional diversity in habitat management and reserve design plans.

AB Questions What are the species and functional trait composition of riparian forests in near-natural Southwest European rivers? Are functional trait and species assemblages constrained by environment? Location Near-natural riparian habitats throughout mainland Portugal, Southwest Europe. Methods We collected data on riparian woody abundances and environmental variables from 175 river locations. Twenty-eight key functional traits were assigned to the surveyed species. Hierarchical clustering and indicator species analysis were used to derive compositional and functional groups of sites. We used Mantel tests to relate species and trait abundances and environmental gradients, and identified sets of relevant variables at diverse spatial scales. Then, four Dispersion indicators were developed to assess the extent to which the groups are constrained by the environment. These measures were tested for significance using iteration procedures. Results Clustering revealed four compositional groups of sites: Alder woods, Ash woods, Tree-heath shrublands and Semi-arid shrublands; and three functional groups: Mixed riparian forests, Shrublands with fleshy fruits and Stress-tolerant shrublands. These groups were primarily defined by broad-scale gradients of climate, elevation and river hierarchy. The most dispersed groups had broad trait composition (e.g. Mixed riparian forests) and were floristically diverse (Alder woods). In general, the compositional groups were more closely related to environmental gradients than the functional groups. Conclusions Assemblages with very specific functional traits or with homogeneous species composition were largely constrained to the most extreme environmental conditions in the study area. Future research to assist environmental management should be directed to the role of fine-scale environmental determinants of riparian assemblages, especially those related to flow variability and water stress.

AB This article presents a framework to diagnose and predict the effects of chemicals, integrating 2 promising tools to incorporate more ecology into ecological risk assessment, namely traits-based approaches and ecological modeling. Traits-based approaches are used increasingly to derive correlations between the occurrence of species traits and chemical exposure from biological and chemical monitoring data. This assessment can also be used in a diagnostic way, i.e., to identify the chemicals probably posing the highest risks to the aquatic ecosystems. The article also describes how ecological models can be used to explore how traits govern the species-substance interactions and to predict effects at the individual, population, and community and ecosystem level, i.e., from the receptor to the landscape level. This can be done by developing models describing the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of the chemical in the individual, the life-history of species and the connectivity of populations, determining their recovery, and the food web relations at the community and ecosystem level that determine the indirect effects. Special attention is given on how spatial aspects can be included in the ecological risk assessments using ecological models. The components of the framework are introduced and critically discussed. We describe how the different tools and data generated through experimentation (laboratory and semifield) and biomonitoring can be integrated. The article uses examples from the aquatic compartment, but the concepts that are used, and their integration within the framework, can be generalized to other environmental compartments.

AB We studied benthic macroinvertebrate communities upstream and downstream of five small reservoirs (surface release in autumn-winters) (north Spain) to assess the effect of flow regulation on structural and functional characteristics of stream ecosystems. We based our approach on the use of structural metrics (density, biomass, richness and diversity) in combination with two functional diversity indices based on biological and ecological traits: FDPG index, related to species richness, and FDQ, which incorporates evenness across taxa. Although water physicochemical parameters were unaffected by the reservoirs during the study period (autumn-winter), macroinvertebrate metrics were lower below the dams, with detritivores (shredders and collector-gatherers) being the most affected. The alder leaf breakdown rate estimated by the litter-bag technique was related to the density, biomass, richness, diversity and FDPG index of shredders, compromising the ecosystem functioning. The most plausible origin for the observed differences in macroinvertebrate metrics between upstream and downstream reaches was the change of the flow regime caused by the impoundments at downstream sites, leading to droughts in summer in those naturally permanently flowing streams. The observed functional diversity loss might reduce the chances of the community to override natural or man-induced fluctuations in their environment with possible repercussions on important ecosystem functions and services.

AB Inter and intra-population variation in morphological traits, such as body size and shape, provides important insights into the ecological importance of individual natural populations. The radiation of Diaptomid species (similar to 400 species) has apparently produced little morphological differentiation other than those in secondary sexual characteristics, suggesting sexual, rather than ecological, selection has driven speciation. This evolutionary history suggests that species, and conspecific populations, would be ecologically redundant but recent work found contrasting ecosystem effects among both species and populations. This study provides the first quantification of shape variation among species, populations, and/or sexes (beyond taxonomic illustrations and body size measurements) to gain insight into the ecological differentiation of Diaptomids. Here we quantify the shape of five Diaptomid species (family Diaptomidae) from four populations each, using morphometric landmarks on the prosome, urosome, and antennae. We partition morphological variation among species, populations, and sexes, and test for phenotype-by-environment correlations to reveal possible functional consequences of shape variation. We found that intraspecific variation was 18-35% as large as interspecific variation across all measured traits. Interspecific variation in body size and relative antennae length, the two traits showing significant sexual dimorphism, were correlated with lake size and geographic location suggesting some niche differentiation between species. Observed relationships between intraspecific morphological variation and the environment suggest that divergent selection in contrasting lakes might contribute to shape differences among local populations, but confirming this requires further analyses. Our results show that although Diaptomid species differ in their reproductive traits, they also differ in other morphological traits that might indicate ecological differences among species and populations.

AB Free-living nematodes are efficiently used as bio-indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in marine ecosystems. Among various criteria, functional traits may represent useful tools for monitoring environmental impact in coastal areas. A study of nematode assemblages was carried out in three locations of the Central Adriatic Sea (Italy), one at the mouth of the Foglia River (Baia Flaminia) and two enclosed in the Monte San Bartolo Natural Park (Monte Brisighella and Fiorenzuola di Focara). Taxonomic composition and the functional traits of the nematode assemblage revealed a possible influence of the organic load of the Foglia River. Biotic data, as well as environmental parameters, suggested a particularly negative impact of the river on the assemblage at Baia Flaminia. Here, the increasing impact of the river led to a rise in the relative abundance of r-strategist genera like Chromadora, Sabatieria and Viscosia. Poor ecological conditions were also present at Brisighella, where the river might exert its influence due to the presence of long shore currents. In contrast, the results revealed that the best ecological quality was at Fiorenzuola di Focara, where the impact of anthropogenic activities was generally irrelevant. This study documents how nematodes can be used as an early warning indicator with which to monitor the health quality of vulnerable littoral areas.

AB River impoundments and waste water discharge are a serious threat to the integrity and biodiversity of river ecosystems, especially in central Italy. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled in autumn and summer along the Aniene River to assess the cumulative biological effect of the numerous dams and sewage treatment plants that affect its middle and lower course. We hypothesized that (i) increasing habitat impairment would promote the formation of nestedness in species assemblage, where species poor locations support only a sub-set of organisms from richer sites; (ii) specific life-history traits would confer sensitivity to habitat degradation. Patterns of macroinvertebrate richness and diversity along the river tracked the distribution of dams and sewage treatment plants. Partial Mantel test showed that dissimilarity in assemblages increased with the number of dams and treatment plants between reaches after controlling for longitudinal distance. Assemblages were significantly nested, and nestedness appeared related to both water quality gradients (phosphorous, turbidity) that reflected anthropogenic inputs, and to natural gradient in altitude. Reaches with nested assemblages (supporting a sub-set of the species pool) were characterized by greater representations of taxa with shorter life cycles, while, in contrast, species rich sites supported taxa with longer life cycles and lower dispersal ability. These results suggest that the cumulative effect of dams and sewage treatment plants promoted the formation of nested subsets in species distribution. Moreover, it appeared that certain functional traits that conferred sensitivity also dictated the progressive non-random loss of taxa in face of multiple anthropogenic stressors. These findings have conservation implications in the regions, but need to be considered preliminary since anthropogenic and natural factors co-varied systematically along the study river precluding the identification of single factor effects.

AB The application of functional approaches in understanding phytoplankton community-level responses to changes in the environment has become increasingly widespread in recent years. Eutrophication is known to cause profound modifications in ecosystem processes; however, the underlying relationships between environmental drivers and phytoplankton diversity and functioning are complex and largely unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated and compared the temporal diversity patterns of phytoplankton functional groups in the mesotrophic eastern and eutrophic western basin of the shallow Lake Balaton situated in Hungary. Diversity data were derived from taxonomic composition and biomass data corresponding to the years 2005-2006 and 2008-2009. With the use of cluster analysis, phytoplankton species were classified into eight distinct groups representing different combinations of functionally relevant traits including greatest axial linear dimension; surface-to-volume ratio; photosynthetic pigment composition; N-2 fixation; phagotrophic potential; growth form/complexity (unicell, filamentous, colony-, or coenobium-forming); and motility. Our results have revealed that there is a significant inverse relationship between the functional group diversity used in our study and trophic state (total phytoplankton biomass) as opposed to species diversity, where no correlation was observed. In addition, group evenness showed an even stronger negative correlation with trophic state, while species evenness yielded only a weak relationship. The observed variability in functional group diversity suggests that such an approach could provide an efficient means of revealing structural changes in phytoplankton communities, establishing new hypotheses and highlighting fundamental points in ecosystem functioning.

AB In the long term absence of catastrophic disturbance ecosystem retrogression occurs, and this is characterized by reduced soil fertility, and impairment of plant biomass and productivity. The response of plant traits to retrogression remains little explored. We investigated how changes plant traits and litter decomposability shift during retrogression for dominant trees and understory shrubs.
   We characterized changes in intraspecific, interspecific and community-averaged values of plant traits and litter decomposability, for six abundant species across thirty lake islands in boreal forest that undergo retrogression with increasing time since fire.
   For understory shrubs, trait values and litter decomposability often changed as soil fertility declined in a manner reflective of greater conservation (versus acquisition) of nutrients, particularly at the interspecific and whole community levels. Such responses were seldom observed for trees, meaning that trees and shrubs show a decoupled response to declining soil fertility during retrogression.
   Our results only partially agree with previous studies on temperate and subtropical retrogressive chronosequences. Because traits of only shrubs were responsive, they also highlight that impairment of belowground ecosystem processes during retrogression is primarily driven by changes in the trait spectra of understory vegetation rather than that of the trees.

AB The evolution of reproductive isolation in an ecological context may involve multiple facets of species divergence on which divergent selection may operate. These include variation in quantitative phenotypic traits, regulation of gene expression, and differential transmission of particular allelic combinations. Thus, an integrative approach to the speciation process involves identifying the genetic basis of these traits, in order to understand how they are affected by divergent selection in nature and how they ultimately contribute to reproductive isolation. In the Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), dwarf and normal species pairs sympatrically occur in several North American postglacial lakes. The limnetic dwarf whitefish distinguishes from its normal benthic relative by numerous life history, behavioural, morphological and gene expression traits, in relation with the exploitation of distinct ecological niches. Here, we have applied the RAD-Sequencing method to a hybrid backcross family to reconstruct a high-density genetic linkage map and perform QTL mapping in the Lake Whitefish. The 3061cM map encompassed 3438 segregating RAD markers distributed over 40 linkage groups, for an average resolution of 0.89cM. We mapped phenotypic and expression QTL underlying ecologically important traits as well as transmission ratio distortion QTL, and identified genomic regions harbouring clusters of such QTL. A narrow genomic region strongly associated with sex determination was also evidenced. Positional and functional information revealed in this study will be useful in ongoing population genomic studies to illuminate our understanding of the genomic architecture of reproductive isolation between whitefish species pairs.

AB Genetic variation within and among six populations of Juniperus excelsa M. Bieb., in a common garden in Lakes District of Turkey, was analyzed using four nuclear microsatellite primer pairs originally developed for J. communis. A total of five loci were observed as Jc037 amplified two distinct size ranges. The number of alleles observed for the species varied from 2 to 13, with an average of 4.5 alleles per locus. The mean expected heterozygosity (H (e)) of populations was 0.584, after correction for null alleles. The mean F (IS) value (-0.014) was close to zero showing no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A low level of genetic differentiation was observed among populations (F (ST) = 0.028; p < 0.001) and Nei's genetic distance ranged from 0.014 to 0.120 between population pairs. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between genetic distances on the one hand and geographic distances and trait differentiation on the other hand. However, the eastern populations BeyAYehir and Sorgun showed very similar genotypic structures and were differentiated from all other populations. A continuous monitoring of phenotypic traits and the association between nucleotide variation in functional genes and adaptive traits such as drought and frost tolerance of J. excelsa populations in common gardens will be useful to design effective conservation strategies in the future.

AB Species traits have been identified as a component of biodiversity that is worthy of investigation as a tool for exploring ecological effects of anthropogenic disturbances. We used meta-analysis to show how selected species traits of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera can be used to examine the ecological effects of flow and water-level regulation in freshwater ecosystems used for hydropower generation. We hypothesized that hydrological regulation would favor an opportunistic ecological strategy and bring about increased similarity in species composition across samples. We found higher reproductive capacity, faster life cycles, and a tendency toward a changed composition of functional feeding groups in lotic stonefly assemblages in response to hydrological regulation. However, the effects of hydrological regulation on mayfly species traits and lentic stonefly species traits were limited. We found lower species turnover in mayflies and stoneflies from regulated than from unregulated lotic and lentic sites, a result suggesting selection of a subset of mayflies and stoneflies from the regional species pool by flow and water-level regulation. The limited support for our predictions probably reflects the comparatively low diversity of aquatic insect species in Norwegian freshwater ecosystems for biogeographical and historical reasons, phenotypic plasticity of the insects' life histories and feeding habits, low trait diversity, trade-offs among species traits in a marginal region, restrictions to trait combinations and, perhaps, random extinction of mayflies and stoneflies caused by hydrological regulation. We advocate inclusion of species-trait variables that may affect ecosystem-level ecological processes in environmental assessment studies because a better understanding of trait-mediated ecological functioning should facilitate assessment of the ecological consequences of anthropogenic perturbations of freshwater ecosystems.

AB The use of species traits in basic and applied ecology is expanding rapidly because trait-based approaches hold the promise to increase our mechanistic understanding of biological responses. Such understanding could transform descriptive field studies in community ecology into predictive studies. Currently, however, trait-based approaches often fail to reflect species-environment relationships adequately. The difficulties have been perceived mainly as methodological, but we suggest that the problem is more profound and touches on the fundamentals of ecology and evolution. Selection pressures do not act independently on single traits, but rather, on species whose success in a particular environment is controlled by many interacting traits. Therefore, the adaptive value of a particular trait may differ across species, depending on the other traits possessed by the species and the constraints of its body plan. Because of this context-dependence, trait-based approaches should take into account the way combinations of traits interact and are constrained within a species. We present a new framework in which trade-offs and other interactions between biological traits are taken as a starting point from which to develop a better mechanistic understanding of species occurrences. The framework consists of 4 levels: traits, trait interactions, trait combinations, and life-history strategies, in a hierarchy in which each level provides the building blocks for the next. Researchers can contribute knowledge and insights at each level, and their contributions can be verified or falsified using logic, theory, and empirical data. Such an integrated and transparent framework can help fulfill the promise of traits to transform community ecology into a predictive science.

AB A functional understanding of processes involved in adaptive divergence is one of the awaiting opportunities afforded by high-throughput transcriptomic technologies. Functional analysis of coexpressed genes has succeeded in the biomedical field in identifying key drivers of disease pathways. However, in ecology and evolutionary biology, functional interpretation of transcriptomic data is still limited. Here, we used Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of coexpressed genes in muscle and brain tissue of a lake whitefish backcross progeny. Modules were connected to gradients of known adaptive traits involved in the ecological speciation process between benthic and limnetic ecotypes. Key drivers, that is, hub genes of functional modules related to reproduction, growth, and behavior were identified, and module preservation was assessed in natural populations. Using this approach, we identified modules of coexpressed genes involved in phenotypic divergence and their key drivers, and further identified a module part specifically rewired in the backcross progeny. Functional analysis of transcriptomic data can significantly contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying ecological speciation. Our findings point to bone morphogenetic protein and calcium signaling as common pathways involved in coordinated evolution of trophic behavior, trophic morphology (gill rakers), and reproduction. Results also point to pathways implicating hemoglobins and constitutive stress response (HSP70) governing growth in lake whitefish.

AB Aim One of the main gaps in the assessment of biodiversity is the lack of a unified framework for measuring its taxonomic and functional facets and for unveiling the underlying patterns. Location Europe, 25 large river basins. Methods Here, we develop a decomposition of functional -diversity, i.e. the dissimilarity in functional composition between communities, into a functional turnover and a functional nestedness-resultant component. Results We found that functional -diversity was lower than taxonomic -diversity. This difference was driven by a lower functional turnover compared with taxonomic turnover while the nestedness-resultant component was similar for taxonomic and functional -diversity. Main conclusions Fish faunas with different species tend to share the same functional attributes. The framework presented in this paper will help to analyse biogeographical patterns as well as to measure the impact of human activities on the functional facets of biodiversity.

AB Metabolic plasticity and functional redundancy are fundamental properties of microbial communities, which shape their response to environmental forcing, and also mediate the relationship between community composition and function. Yet, the actual quantification of these emergent community properties has been elusive, and we thus do not know how they vary across bacterial communities, and their relationship to environmental gradients and to each other. Here we present an experimental framework that allows us to simultaneously quantify metabolic plasticity and functional redundancy in freshwater bacterioplankton communities, and to explore connections that may exists between them. We define metabolic plasticity as the rate of change in single-cell properties (cell wall integrity, cell size, single-cell activity) relative to changes in community composition. Likewise, we define functional redundancy as the rate of change in carbon substrate uptake capacities relative to changes in community composition. We assessed these two key community attributes in transplant experiments where bacterioplankton from various aquatic habitats within the same watershed were transplanted from their original water to waters from other systems that differ in their main resources. Our results show that metabolic plasticity is an intrinsic property of bacterial communities, whereas the expression of functional redundancy appears to be more dependent on environmental factors. Furthermore, there was an overall strong positive relationship between the level of functional redundancy and of metabolic plasticity, suggesting no trade-offs between these community attributes but rather a possible co-selection. The apparent continuum in the expression of both functional redundancy and plasticity among bacterial communities and the link between them, in turn suggest that the link between community diversity and function may also vary along a continuum, from being very tight, to being weak, or absent.

AB Insect herbivore-plant associations have been widely explored in the scientific literature over the past decades, but other insect-plant associations have received little focus so far. Tank-bromeliads host a large number of invertebrate species and, even though previous studies showed a strong variation in community composition among tank-bromeliad species, the reasons for this variation are still unclear. In this study, we first examined whether different bromeliad species supports distinct and predictable community compositions and whether such variation was caused by (i) the bromeliad species itself, (ii) to its environment, and/or (iii) the covariance between both. We found that different tank-bromeliad species hosts distinct macroinvertebrate assemblages, but community composition was particularly less predictable in the smaller tank-bromeliads. Aquatic macroinvertebrates were sorted along a gradient of environmental conditions presented by the set of tank-bromeliad species examined, according to their functional and biological traits. The tank-bromeliad species and the environmental conditions within its tanks were strongly related and equally important in structuring these communities. These results suggest that associations between bromeliads and the fauna inhabiting its tanks are likely a result of the environmental characteristics particular to each bromeliad species.

AB Functional groups of phytoplankton are widely recognized to vary in response to certain environmental variables, according to their niche preferences. The aim of this study was to evaluate the strength of the relationship between functional traits of phytoplankton and environmental predictors in a spatially heterogeneous large subtropical shallow lake (Mangueira Lake, southern Brazil), analyzing whether phytoplankton functional approach is a suitable tool to investigate spatial heterogeneity. Samples were taken twice a year (summer and winter), for six years (2001-2006) in the subsurface water at north, center and south sampling stations in that large system (90 km long). This biannual frequency enabled us to evaluate the seasonal and spatial changes of functional groups in relation to environmental variations, by means of ordination analysis (PCA and CCA). The integrated analysis of phytoplankton functional groups and abiotic variables evidenced clear and significant spatial and seasonal gradients (Monte Carlo test, p = 0.01). The seasonal gradient was related to temperature, water-level fluctuations and wind action, leading to spatial heterogeneity of the phytoplankton. The northern part of the lake proved to be dissimilar, with greater availability of soluble reactive phosphorus and higher biomass of phytoplankton. Functional groups related to turbid and mixed environments, such as MP, S1 and J were important. Hydrodynamics-related features were the driving forces for structuring the phytoplankton functional groups, which appropriately showed the main tendencies observed in this ecosystem, proving to be and adequate tool to access spatial heterogeneity.

AB Zooplankton are major primary consumers and predators in most aquatic ecosystems. They exhibit tremendous diversity of traits, ecological strategies and, consequently, impacts on other trophic levels and the cycling of materials and energy. An adequate representation of this diversity in community and ecosystem models is necessary to generate realistic predictions on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems but remains extremely challenging. We propose that the use of trait-based approaches is a promising way to reduce complexity while retaining realism in developing novel descriptions of zooplankton in ecosystem models. Characterizing zooplankton traits and trade-offs will also be helpful in understanding the selection pressures and diversity patterns that emerge in different ecosystems along major environmental gradients. Zooplankton traits can be characterized according to their function and type. Some traits, such as body size and motility, transcend several functions and are major determinants of zooplankton ecological strategies. Future developments of trait-based approaches to zooplankton should assemble a comprehensive matrix of key traits for diverse groups and explore it for general patterns; develop novel predictive models that explicitly incorporate traits and associated trade-offs; and utilize these traits to explain and predict zooplankton community structure and dynamics under different environmental conditions, including global change scenarios.

AB The Atlantic Forest domain, one of the 25 world's hotspots for biodiversity, has experienced dramatic changes in its landscape. While the loss of species diversity is well documented, functional diversity has not received the same amount of attention. In this study, we evaluated functional diversity of insects in streams utilizing three indices: functional diversity (FD), functional dispersion (FDis), and functional divergence (FDiv), seeking to understand the roles of three predictor sets in explaining functional patterns: (1) bioclimatic and landscape variables; (2) spatial variables; and (3) local environmental variables. We determined the amount of variation in different measures of functional diversity that was explained by each predictor set and their interplays using variation partitioning. Our study showed that variation in functional diversity is better explained by a set of variables linked to different scales dependent on spatial structures, indicating the importance of landscape and mainly environmental variables in the functional organization of aquatic insect communities, and that the relative importance of predictor sets depends on the indices considered. Variation in FD was better explained by the interplay among the three predictor sets and by local environmental variables, whereas variation in FDis was better explained by spatial variables and by the interplay between environmental and spatial variables. Variation in FDiv was not significantly explained by any predictors. Our study adds more evidence on the harmful effects caused by landscape changes on biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest, suggesting that these effects also influence the functional organization of stream insect communities.

AB Despite divergent evolutionary histories, Neotropical cichlids (Cichlidae) and Nearctic sunfishes (Centrarchidae) appear to have similar functional morphotypes and occupy similar ecological niches. We applied an integrative approach analyzing morphological traits, stomach contents, and stable isotope ratios (13C, 15N) to investigate whether local assemblages of cichlids (Venezuela, Peru) and centrarchids (Texas) reveal one-to-one patterns of morphological and ecological convergence. Multivariate ordinations performed on diet and morphology datasets identified a broad overlap between cichlid and centrarchid assemblages. The functional morphology of the two groups has diversified in a convergent manner within the confines of ram-suction modes of prey ingestion. Both groups had the same set of ecomorph types that corresponded to the same trophic niches, including substrate-sifting invertivores, epibenthic invertebrate gleaners, and piscivores; the one exception was a molluscivorous sunfish, comprising a niche that was not represented in the two cichlid assemblages. Estimates of trophic positions based on stable isotope analysis revealed convergent vertical trophic structure; with few exceptions, fishes with similar morphologies had similar trophic positions. Large-bodied piscivores had highest trophic positions, whereas small and medium-bodied generalists and invertivores had low to intermediate trophic positions. Consistent patterns of ecomorphological convergence in these two perciform groups provide strong evidence for adaptation involving constrains in functional morphology associated with feeding.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 146164.

AB Although functional trait variability is increasingly used in community ecology, the scale- and size-dependent aspects of trait variation are usually disregarded. Here we quantified the spatial structure of shoot height, branch length, root/shoot ratio and leaf number in a macrophyte species Potamogeton maackianus, and then disentangled the environmental and ontogenetic effects on these traits. Using a hierarchical nested design, we measured the four traits from 681 individuals across five ecological scales: lake, transect, depth stratus, quadrat and individual. A notable high trait variation (coefficient variation: 48-112%) was observed within species. These traits differed in the spatial structure, depending on environmental factors of different scales. Shoot height and branch length were most responsive to lake, transect and depth stratus scales, while root/shoot ratio and leaf number to quadrat and individual scales. The trait variations caused by environment are nearly three times higher than that caused by ontogeny, with ontogenetic variance ranging from 21% (leaf number) to 33% (branch length) of total variance. Remarkably, these traits showed non-negligible ontogenetic variation (0-60%) in each ecological scale, and significant shifts in allometric trajectories at lake and depth stratus scales. Our results highlight that environmental filtering processes can sort individuals within species with traits values adaptive to environmental changes and ontogenetic variation of functional traits was non-negligible across the five ecological scales.

AB Background: Riparian habitats are subjected to frequent inundation (flooding) and are characterised by food webs that exhibit variability in aquatic/terrestrial subsidies across the ecotone. The strength of this subsidy in active riparian floodplains is thought to underpin local biodiversity. Terrestrial invertebrates dominate the fauna, exhibiting traits that allow exploitation of variable aquatic subsidies while reducing inundation pressures, leading to inter-species micro-spatial positioning. The effect these strategies have on prey selection is not known. This study hypothesised that plasticity in prey choice from either aquatic or terrestrial sources is an important trait linked to inundation tolerance and avoidance.
   Method/Principal Findings: We used hydrological, isotopic and habitat analyses to investigate the diet of riparian Coleoptera in relation to inundation risk and relative spatial positioning in the floodplain. The study examined patch scale and longitudinal changes in utilisation of the aquatic subsidy according to species traits. Prey sourced from terrestrial or emerging/stranded aquatic invertebrates varied in relation to traits for inundation avoidance or tolerance strategies. Traits that favoured rapid dispersal corresponded with highest proportions of aquatic prey, with behavioural traits further predicting uptake. Less able dispersers showed minimal use of aquatic subsidy and switched to a terrestrial diet under moderate inundation pressures. All trait groups showed a seasonal shift in diet towards terrestrial prey in the early spring. Prey selection became exaggerated towards aquatic prey in downstream samples.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that partitioning of resources and habitat creates overlapping niches that increase the processing of external subsidies in riparian habitats. By demonstrating functional complexity, this work advances understanding of floodplain ecosystem processes and highlights the importance of hydrological variability. With an increasing interest in reconnecting rivers to their floodplains, these invertebrates represent a key functional element in ensuring that such reconnections have demonstrable ecological value.

AB We examined reassembly of winning and losing tree species, species traits including shade and fire tolerance, and associated disturbance filters and forest ecosystem types due to rapid forest change in the Great Lakes region since 1850. We identified winning and losing species by changes in composition, distribution, and site factors between historical and current surveys in Minnesota's mixed and broadleaf forests. In the Laurentian Mixed Forest, shade-intolerant aspen replaced shade-intolerant tamarack as the most dominant tree species. Fire-tolerant white pine and jack pine decreased, whereas shade-tolerant ashes, maples, and white cedar increased. In the Eastern Broadleaf Forest, fire-tolerant white oaks and red oaks decreased, while shade-tolerant ashes, American basswood, and maples increased. Tamarack, pines, and oaks have become restricted to sites with either wetter or sandier and drier soils due to increases in aspen and shade-tolerant, fire-sensitive species on mesic sites. The proportion of shade-tolerant species increased in both regions, but selective harvest reduced the applicability of functional groups alone to specify winners and losers. Harvest and existing forestry practices supported aspen dominance in mixed forests, although without aspen forestry and with fire suppression, mixed forests will transition to a greater composition of shade-tolerant species, converging to forests similar to broadleaf forests. A functional group framework provided a perspective of winning and losing species and traits, selective filters, and forest ecosystems that can be generalized to other regions, regardless of species identity.

AB Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane to the atmosphere, but factors controlling methane emissions from wetlands are a major source of uncertainty in greenhouse gas budgets and projections of future climate change. We conducted a controlled outdoor mesocosm experiment to assess the effects of plant community structure (functional group richness and composition) on potential methane production and potential iron reduction in freshwater emergent marshes. Four plant functional groups (facultative annuals, obligate annuals, reeds, and tussocks) were arranged in a full-factorial design and additional mesocosms were assigned as no-plant controls. Soil samples from the top 10 cm were collected three times during the growing season to determine potential methane production and potential iron reduction (in unamended soils and in soils amended with 200 mM formate). These data were compared to soil organic matter, soil pH, and previously published data on above and belowground plant biomass. We found that functional group richness was less important than the presence of specific functional groups (reeds or tussocks) in mediating potential iron reduction. In our mesocosms, where oxidized iron was abundant and electron donors were limiting, iron reducing bacteria outcompeted methanogens, keeping methane production barely detectable in unamended lab incubations. When the possibility of re-oxidizing iron was eliminated via anaerobic incubations and the electron donor limitation was removed by adding formate, potential methane production increased and followed the same patterns as potential iron reduction. Our findings suggest that in the absence of abundant oxidized iron and/or the presence of abundant electron donors, wetlands dominated by either reeds or tussocks may have increased methane production compared to wetlands dominated by annuals. Depending on functional traits such as plant transport and rhizospheric oxygenation capacities, this could potentially lead to increased methane emissions in some wetlands. Additional research examining the role these plant functional groups play in other aspects of methane dynamics will be useful given the importance of methane as a greenhouse gas.

AB The spatial variability of Chironomidae larvae assemblages was investigated at 6 near-pristine, temperate headwaters in Hungary. Sites were located within a relatively small mountain range but belong to two different catchment areas characterized by highly variable abiotic conditions. We hypothesised there would be differences in taxonomic composition but not in functional composition between different catchment areas and aimed to assess the primary influencing spatial factors structuring the taxonomic and functional compositions of chironomid assemblages. The spatial distribution of chironomid assemblages was examined 4 times during a 1 year period at microhabitat to catchment scales. At each site, streambed morphology, physicochemical attribute, riparian vegetation, microclimate and hydrology data were collected. Three main traits (saprobic preference, stream zonation preference, functional feeding groups) were used to characterize the functional composition of chironomid assemblages. Sharp differences were detected in taxonomic composition between the two sides of the mountain range within a relatively small spatial distance and moderate, but statistically significant differences in functional composition between catchments. The observed spatial changes in taxonomic and functional composition of midges accompanied changes in physicochemical characteristics, riparian vegetation, microclimate and altitude. Internal microhabitat heterogeneity also played a major role in structuring the taxonomic and the functional patterns of chironomid assemblages.

AB Rapid changes in global climate are likely to alter species assemblages and environmental characteristics resulting in novel ecosystems. The ability to predict characteristics of future ecosystems is crucial for environmental planning and the development of effective climate change adaptation strategies. This paper presents an approach for envisioning novel ecosystems in future climates. Focusing on riparian ecosystems, we use qualitative process models to predict likely abiotic and biotic changes in four case study systems: tropical coastal floodplains, temperate streams, high mountain streams and urban riparian zones. We concentrate on functional groups rather than individual species and consider dispersal constraints and the capacity for genetic adaptation. Our scenarios suggest that climatic changes will reduce indigenous diversity, facilitate non-indigenous invasion (especially C4 graminoids), increase fragmentation and result in simplified and less distinctive riparian ecosystems. Compared to models based on biota-environment correlations, process models built on mechanistic understanding (like Bayesian belief networks) are more likely to remain valid under novel climatic conditions. We posit that predictions based on species' functional traits will facilitate regional comparisons and can highlight effects of climate change on ecosystem structure and function. Ecosystems that have experienced similar modification to that expected under climate change (for example, altered flow regimes of regulated rivers) can be used to help inform and evaluate predictions. By manipulating attributes of these system models (for example, magnitude of climatic changes or adaptation strategies used), implications of various scenarios can be assessed and optimal management strategies identified.

AB The dynamics of abiotic and biotic environmental factors, like temperature and predation, can strongly influence the effects of anthropogenic chemical pollutants in natural systems. Responses to toxicants and their interactions with environmental factors can occur at varying temporal scales and at different levels of biological complexity (from cells to organisms, populations, communities and ecosystems). Environmental factors may affect tolerance to toxic pollutants under non-stressful conditions, and cause adverse multiple stressor effects under stressful conditions. Adaptive processes, however, have the potential to either mitigate (by co-tolerance) or increase (due to associated costs) the sensitivity of individuals, populations, and communities to pollutants through selection and evolution of traits (at the individual and population levels) and changes in species composition (at the community level). Responses to such multiple stressor effects on different biological levels and temporal scales are not considered in current risk assessment practices. We suggest that these effects should and can be addressed by: (i) designing ecotoxicological experiments with temporal exposure patterns that accommodate adaptive processes, (ii) using trait-based approaches to assess biological responses and natural selection in an integrated manner, and (iii) using energy allocation models to link responses at different levels of biological organization.

AB The study of asymmetry can provide insights into genetic and environmental influences on organismal development. Directional asymmetry (DA) can be either adaptive or non-adaptive, whereas fluctuating asymmetry (FA) defined as small non-directional departures from symmetry in bilateral traits is thought to be an indicator of genetic or environmental stress experienced during development. Using data from 28 European populations, we assessed the degree of DA and FA in the lateral plates of threespine sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus and surveyed the direction of DA and differences in levels of DA and FA in different habitat types (viz. marine, lake and river populations). DA differed between habitats, with right-biased DA found in the marine populations and no directional bias found in lake and river populations. Differences in DA among habitats may be a by-product of habitat-specific developmental instability resulting in asymmetry, or it may indicate habitat-specific differences in selection against/for symmetry, as has been proposed in previous research of sticklebacks. Also, the presence of FA varied depending upon habitat type, but it also depended on plate morph a variable confounded with the habitat effect. While we cannot rule out factors such as stress as a cause of population differences in FA, it may also simply be a by-product of other evolutionary processes (e.g. lateral plate number reduction) without functional basis.

AB Marine sessile benthic organisms living on hard substrates have evolved a variety of attachment strategies. Rhizotrochus (Scleractinia, Flabellidae) is a representative azooxanthellate solitary scleractinian coral with a wide geographical distribution and unique attachment structures; it firmly attaches to hard substrates using numerous tube-like rootlets, which are extended from a corallum wall, whereas most sessile corals are attached by stereome-reinforced structures at their corallite bases. Detailed morphological and constructional traits of the rootlets themselves, along with their evolutionary significance, have not yet been fully resolved. Growth and developmental processes of spines in Truncatoflabellum and rootlets in Rhizotrochus suggest that these structures are homologous, as they both develop from the growth edges of walls and are formed by transformation of wall structures and their skeletal microstructures possess similar characteristics, such as patterns of rapid accretion and thickening deposits. Taking molecular phylogeny and fossil records of flabellids into consideration, Rhizotrochus evolved from a common free-living ancestor and invaded hard-substrate habitats by exploiting rootlets of spines origin, which were adaptive for soft-substrate environments.

AB Although experiencing strong anthropogenic pressures in many estuaries, the ecology of tidal freshwater areas remains largely undocumented. As part of a restoration project in the freshwater zone of the Schelde estuary (Belgium), a new tidal habitat restoration technique (Controlled Reduced Tide system, CRT) was hypothesised to successfully compensate for the impairment of contemporary habitats. The suitability of this newly-created habitat (CRT) and the estuary was investigated over a period of three years for its macroinvertebrate community development. In both the estuary and the CRT, habitats along a flooding gradient were monitored. Differences between the CRT and reference sites in community functioning were explored according to environmental characteristics and organism biological attributes using the RLQ ordination analysis together with the fourth-corner method. Frequently flooded reference sites exhibited environmental characteristics resulting from a hydrological shear stress. In the CRT, after a rapid removal of the terrestrial fauna at low and mid elevations, the low-energy hydrology led to taxonomic and functional enrichment. The RLQ analysis produced significant environmental filtering of biological attributes mainly related to the terrestrial aquatic transition and to the environmental stressors. This provides an example of life history modification via estuarine ecosystem management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To understand gene expression networks leading to functional properties and compositional traits of the soybean seed, we have undertaken a detailed examination of soybean seed development from a few days post-fertilization to the mature seed using Illumina high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). RNA was sequenced from seven different stages of seed development, yielding between 12 million and 78 million sequenced transcripts. These have been aligned to the 79,000 gene models predicted from the soybean genome recently sequenced by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. Over one hundred gene models were identified with high expression exclusively in young seed stages, starting at just four days after fertilization. These were annotated as being related to many basic components and processes such as histones and proline-rich proteins. Genes encoding storage proteins such as glycinin and beta-conglycinin had their highest expression levels at the stages of largest fresh weight, confirming previous knowledge that these storage products are being rapidly accumulated before the seed begins the desiccation process. Other gene models showed high expression in the dry, mature seeds, perhaps indicating the preparation of pathways needed later, in the early stages of imbibition. Many highly-expressed gene models at the dry seed stage are, as expected, annotated as hydrophilic proteins associated with low water conditions, such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and dehydrins, which help preserve the cellular structures and nutrients within the seed during desiccation. More significantly, the power of RNA-Seq to detect genes expressed at low levels revealed hundreds of transcription factors with notable expression in at least one stage of seed development. Results from a second biological replicate demonstrate high reproducibility of these data revealing a comprehensive view of the transciptome of seed development in the cultivar Williams, the reference cultivar for the first soybean genome sequence.

AB Questions: What are the selective landscapes structuring inter-population variability on the Haida Gwaii archipelago? How much morphological variability is functional given the common potential for stochastic founder effects when new habitats are colonized?
   Organism and sites: Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from 56 isolated watersheds with separate marine ancestry encompassing 102 freshwater localities ranging from large oligotrophic mountain lakes to darkly stained bog lakes and ponds on the Haida Gwaii archipelago, western Canada.
   Field data: Biophysical attributes of the habitat (lake volume, depth, percent light transmission at 400 nm, calcium availability, pH, distance to marine waters, predation regime including puncturing, compression, and grappling species), morphological traits of the fish (body size, body depth, lateral plate number and position, dorsal spine length, pelvic girdle size, ascending process height, cross-sectional diameter, basal and lateral plate structural overlap), and geographical distance between localities. Based on previous surveys in this archipelago, we predicted the greatest expression of post-capture defences in lakes with high water clarity and the greatest reduction in small stained ponds, as this characterizes regular shifts in the predation landscape.
   Analyses: Principal components, univariate linear models, and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) analyses.
   Results: Populations range from 30 to 90 mm in adult male standard length, from full-plated to naked, and from full-spined to un-spined. Again and again, populations converge towards functional multivariate or univariate phenotypes predicted by the biophysical attributes of each habitat, primarily lake volume, aquatic spectra, and predation regime. Across a broad diversity of lake volumes, body size is larger in stained lakes and we hypothesize that this is a defence adaptation for increased burst velocity and rapid access to the aphotic zones near the water surface. Defence armour is well developed in clear lakes, independent of lake volume, and in large stained lakes. Completely plated populations are only found in clear habitats. Reduction in posterior plates is associated with accentuated armour development in the anterior trunk in large lakes where predatory vertebrates are common. Anterior armour, including lateral plates and spines, is progressively reduced towards an unarmoured condition in shallow, stained ponds.
   Conclusion: Threespine stickleback from pristine lakes and ponds on the Haida Gwaii archipelago demonstrate remarkable morphological differentiation among populations associated with habitat differences that is largely consistent with changes in predation regime, potentially mediated through a shift from post-capture to pursuit adaptations. Thus, even if founder effects occur when new populations are colonized, natural selection is a major determinant of morphological evolution. Our study emphasizes the efficacy of selective landscapes in this adaptive radiation and provides an opportunity for informed integration of emerging genome-wide data of these populations.

AB Interspecific relationships among species mean leaf traits, performance and species resource/climate distributions help provide the foundation for a predictive, functionally based plant ecology. Intraspecific responses of leaf traits and performance to resource gradients and how these vary among species may be equally important but have received less attention. Here, we examine relationships between proxies of soil resource availability, leaf traits and growth (height at 25 years, SI25) for winter deciduous Larix decidua Mill. and evergreen Pinus resinosa Ait. trees distributed over soil resource gradients in the Great Lakes region of North America. We predicted that (i) leaf trait responses to soil resources within species will be similar to reported distributions of mean leaf traits over soil resource gradients among species; (ii) soil resource-related variation in leaf traits can help explain SI25; and (iii) SI25 will be greater for Larix than Pinus at higher soil resources and greater for Pinus than Larix at lower soil resources and this pattern will be associated with species differences in leaf trait responses to soil resources. Among the measured leaf traits (live N, Mg, Ca, K, P, and Mn, litter N, N resorption, carbon isotope discrimination, specific leaf area, lifespan), soil resources only impacted live and litter N for both species and K for Pinus. In turn, only the leaf traits responsive to soil resources affected SI25 in the expected manner. Larix had greater SI25 than Pinus across soil resource gradients and both species had similar growth and leaf trait sensitivities to resources. In summary: (i) several leaf traits reported to be associated with performance and edaphic distributions across species were, within species, unresponsive to nitrogen and water availability and unrelated to growth; (ii) leaf N showed high plasticity to soil resources and this plasticity was functionally relevant to growth over its entire range of response; (iii) large species-level differences in leaf traits between Larix and Pinus did not translate into different leaf trait and growth responses to soil resources.

AB Niche theory predicts that coexisting species minimise competition by evolving morphological or behavioural specialisations that allow them to spread out along resource axes such as space, diet and temporal activity. These specialisations define how a species interacts with its environment and, by extension, determine its functional role. Here, we examine the feeding niche of three species of coral reef-dwelling rabbitfishes (Siganidae, Siganus). By comparing aspects of their feeding behaviour (bite location, bite rate, foraging distance) with that of representative species from two other abundant herbivorous fish families, the parrotfishes (Labridae, Scarus) and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae, Acanthurus), we examine whether rabbitfishes have a feeding niche distinct from other members of the herbivore guild. Measurements of the penetration of the fishes' snouts and bodies into reef concavities when feeding revealed that rabbitfish fed to a greater degree from reef crevices and interstices than other herbivores. There was just a 40 % overlap in the penetration-depth niche between rabbitfish and surgeonfish and a 45 % overlap between rabbitfish and parrotfish, compared with the almost complete niche overlap (95 %) recorded for parrotfish and surgeonfish along this spatial niche axis. Aspects of the morphology of rabbitfish which may contribute to this niche segregation include a comparatively longer, narrower snout and narrower head. Our results suggest that sympatric coexistence of rabbitfish and other reef herbivores is facilitated by segregation along a spatial (and potentially dietary) axis. This segregation results in a unique functional role for rabbitfishes among roving herbivores that of "crevice-browser": a group that specifically feeds on crevice-dwelling algal or benthic organisms. This functional trait may have implications for reef ecosystem processes in terms of controlling the successional development of crevice-based algal communities, reducing their potential to trigger macroalgal outbreaks.

AB Parallel adaptive radiation events provide a powerful framework for investigations of ecology's contribution to phenotypic diversification. Ecologically driven divergence has been invoked to explain the repeated evolution of sympatric dwarf and normal lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) species in multiple lakes in eastern North America. Nevertheless, links between most putatively adaptive traits and ecological variation remain poorly defined within and among whitefish species pairs. Here, we examine four species pairs for variation in gill, heart, and brain size; three traits predicted to show strong phenotypic responses to ecological divergence. In each of the species pairs, normals exhibited larger body size standardized gills compared to dwarfs a pattern that is suggestive of a common ecological driver of gill size divergence. Within lakes, the seasonal hypoxia experienced in the benthic environment is a likely factor leading to the requirement for larger gills in normals. Interestingly, the morphological pathways used to achieve larger gills varied between species pairs from Quebec and Maine, which may imply subtle non-parallelism in gill size divergence related to differences in genetic background. There was also a non-significant trend toward larger hearts in dwarfs, the more active species of the two, whereas brain size varied exclusively among the lake populations. Taken together, our results suggest that the diversification of whitefish has been driven by parallel and non-parallel ecological conditions across lakes. Furthermore, the phenotypic response to ecological variation may depend on genetic background of each population.

AB The reference condition approach, advocated by the Water Framework Directive, is the basis of most currently used multimetric indices using functional traits of fish species. The ecological status of streams is assessed by measuring the deviation of the observed trait values from the theoretical values of reference conditions in the absence of anthropogenic disturbances. While reference conditions serve as baselines for ecological assessment, they vary with natural environmental conditions. Therefore, global warming appears to be a major threat to the use of current indices for diagnosing future stream conditions, as climate change is projected to modify assemblage composition, suggesting that the functional structure of fish assemblages will also be affected. The main objectives of this study are to assess the potential effect of climate change on the trait composition of fish assemblages and the consequences for the establishment of reference conditions. The results highlight the relation between environmental, especially climatic, conditions and functional traits and project the effects of climate change on trait composition. Traits based on species intolerance are expected to be most negatively affected by the projected climatic shift. The consequences for the development of multimetric indices based on fish functional traits are discussed.

AB 1.We use morphology-based functional groups (MBFGs) of phytoplankton to predict ecological performance of groups with a mechanistic model. We evaluate MBFGs' performance in relation to hypothetical examples of succession and compare it with empirical data for a shallow subtropical hypertrophic lake (Lake Rodo, Uruguay). 2.Our model predicts a trade-off between maximum growth rate (max) and competitive ability (Tilman's R*) for most MBFGs. The model predicts that phytoplankton succession will proceed from groups with high surface/volume, high max and without specialised structures (opportunists) towards the dominance of large colonial or filamentous algae with lower max and specialised traits (gleaners). These predictions are generally congruent with empirical data for Lake Rodo. 3.The MBFG classification explained ecological performance of phytoplankton community dynamics while reducing system dimensionality. Despite species aggregation, MBFGs can resolve the occurrence of potentially noxious groups and thus is a promising tool for understanding and managing ponds and lakes.

AB Community dynamics in temporary waters are constrained by the hydroregime (depth, timing, duration, frequency, and predictability of water in an aquatic habitat), which in turn is influenced by climatic patterns and anthropogenic use of water in the landscape. Declining rainfall in regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as southwestern Australia, has decreased the depth and duration of water in temporary wetlands, potentially altering the composition of invertebrate communities. We used a long-term data set (6-25 y) to examine temporal changes in hydroregimes and aquatic invertebrate diversity (based on species presence/absence) at 9 seasonal wetlands. The study wetlands maintained distinctly seasonal hydroregimes, despite declining rainfall and the contraction of wetland hydroperiods. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) indicated that conductivity, NO3-+NO2-, and turbidity were the most important factors explaining the changes in invertebrate community composition over time. Allocation of species into 4 trait-based groups based on their resilience to or resistance of drought and their mode of recolonization of a water body upon rewetting revealed that the fauna is dominated by active dispersers. This result suggests that the proximity of source wetlands from which mobile invertebrate species and vertebrate vectors, such as waterbirds, can recolonize seasonal wetlands is an important factor influencing the invertebrate community response to rewetting. Despite the decline in water availability, we found little evidence of a shift to a more arid-adapted fauna. We suggest that the maintenance of a mosaic of wetlands of varying hydroregimes at the whole-landscape scale will be critical to the future persistence of aquatic invertebrate communities in Mediterranean regions where the frequency and intensity of droughts is predicted to increase.

AB Biodiversity losses over the next century are predicted to result in alterations of ecosystem functions that are on par with other major drivers of global change. Given the seriousness of this issue, there is a need to effectively monitor global biodiversity. Because performing biodiversity censuses of all taxonomic groups is prohibitively costly, indicator groups have been studied to estimate the biodiversity of different taxonomic groups. Quantifying cross-taxon congruence is a method of evaluating the assumption that the diversity of one taxonomic group can be used to predict the diversity of another. To improve the predictive ability of cross-taxon congruence in aquatic ecosystems, we evaluated whether body size, measured as the ratio of average body length between organismal groups, is a significant predictor of their cross-taxon biodiversity congruence. To test this hypothesis, we searched the published literature and screened for studies that used species richness correlations as their metric of cross-taxon congruence. We extracted 96 correlation coefficients from 16 studies, which encompassed 784 inland water bodies. With these correlation coefficients, we conducted a categorical meta-analysis, grouping data based on the body size ratio of organisms. Our results showed that cross-taxon congruence is variable among sites and between different groups (r values ranging between -0.53 to 0.88). In addition, our quantitative meta-analysis demonstrated that organisms most similar in body size showed stronger species richness correlations than organisms which differed increasingly in size (r(adj)(2) = 0.94, p = 0.02). We propose that future studies applying biodiversity indicators in aquatic ecosystems consider functional traits such as body size, so as to increase their success at predicting the biodiversity of taxonomic groups where cost-effective conservation tools are needed.

AB Mesozooplankton is a highly diverse group of organisms ranging from very small to large herbivorous, omnivorous or predatory forms. However, most aquatic ecosystem models typically contain only one or two state variables which represent all mesozooplankton forms and specify their role in marine food webs. We have extended an existing mass-balanced marine ecosystem model to include a wide range of mesozooplankton size-classes and species growing from small to large, and maturing at different size. The model includes a dynamic pool of fish with a fixed mortality rate as a closure term of the model, and mechanistic expressions for fish predation. The zooplankton consumes phytoplankton and smaller zooplankton, and responds adaptively to the instantaneous local rates of growth and predation by migrating towards more profitable habitats. We run the model for long time in a stable and repetitive diel light cycle, and explore the emerging ecosystem structure and complexity. In the stable environment the presence of fish has strong structuring effects over the size-structure of mesozooplankton, but little influence on phytoplankton because the total biomass of mesozooplankton remains relatively stable over the fish cycles. The inclusion of adaptive and flexible behaviour leads to emergent effects of multiple predators; the removal of intra-guild predation among zooplankton result in low fish abundance because zooplankton spend more time in deeper habitats. The model reveals persistent spatial and cascading behavioural interactions and is a step towards a mechanistic and adaptive representation of the upper trophic levels in ecosystem models.

AB It is well known that Taylor's power law describes spatial aggregation, but its ecological interpretation remains elusive. Here we used data on spatial organization of soil nematode communities in urban landscapes to test relationships between nematode life history characteristics and the power law aggregation indicator, b. Forty seven genera of soil inhabiting nematodes were identified from 360 samples taken from turfgrass lawns at three public schools located in each of three northeast Ohio cities in July and October 2007. The nematodes were classified according to their life-styles in three life history classifications: trophic group, colonizer-persistor (cp) class, and functional guild, a combination of trophic group and cp-class. Estimates of Taylor's b for 28 more common genera ranged from 1.21 to 2.34. Estimates of b for trophic group, cp-class and functional guild ranged from 1.41 to 2.10, 1.34 to 1.97 and 1.41 to 2.39, respectively. Segregating genera by their trophic group, cp-class and functional guild each accounted for as much inter-genus variation in Taylor's power law as fitting 28 separate regressions. The improvements of fit in parallel line analyses for the three life-style categories over 28 lines for individual genera were highly significant. Bacterial- and plant-feeding groups were more highly aggregated than omnivorous and predatory nematodes. Nematodes in cp-classes 1 and 2 tended to be more aggregated than those in higher cp-classes. The functional guilds were generally more highly aggregated than individual genera, suggesting a higher degree of aggregation at the functional guild level. We conclude that nematode genera vary in their spatial organizations, but membership in a cp-class and functional guild accounts for much of this variability. Thus, Taylor's power law aggregation indicator, b, is sensitive to nematode feeding habits and life strategy traits as they influence a population's pattern of spatial organization.

AB Performance of aquatic macrophytes is driven by many environmental factors, and a major challenge is to understand how aquatic macrophyte communities are structured in various environments. In softwater lakes in Western Europe, hydrological state (submersed/emersed), carbon dioxide and ammonium levels and species interactions are considered as driving forces in structuring amphibious plant communities. In this study we aimed at evaluating the relative importance of these factors for four species in a competitive neighbourhood. Softwater lake habitat was simulated during one growing season in laboratory conditions, mimicking water level fluctuation, photoperiod and temperature. Artificial communities consisted of small populations of four softwater macrophyte species: Luronium natans, Baldellia ranunculoides ssp. repens, Eleocharis multicaulis and Hydrocotyle vulgaris. These communities were subjected to two levels of carbon dioxide and ammonium. Additionally, monocultures of Baldellia and Eleocharis were grown at a higher nutrient level combination in order to measure their competitive response in a community. Time (hydrological state) and species identity turned out to be the only consistently significant factors determining community composition. Plant performance was clearly species-dependent, while carbon dioxide and ammonium did not have major effects. The competitive response was significant in both Eleocharis and Baldellia. Competition intensity was highest in the emersed state. Carbon dioxide had a supplementary effect on the within-species performance in Luronium, Baldellia and Eleocharis, with high carbon dioxide level mainly resulting in more flowers and more stolons. Community outcomes and competitive responses in aquatic macrophytes appear difficult to predict, because of mixed life strategies and morphological and functional plasticity. We conclude that hydrological state was the only important environmental factor. The identity of the species that were present-implying species interactions-largely determined community outcome.

AB Pesticides are a major stressor for stream ecosystem health. They enter surface waters from diffuse agricultural sources but also from point sources such as municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, to date, no studies have focused on the ecological effects of pesticide-contaminated WWTP effluent on macroinvertebrate communities. On the basis of governmental monitoring data of 328 sites in Hesse, Germany, we identified insecticidal long-term effects on the structure of the macroinvertebrate community up to 3 km downstream of WWTPs. The effects were quantified using the trait-based SPEAR(pesticides) index, which has been shown to be an effective tool for identifying community effects of pesticide contamination. In addition, based on the German Saprobic Index, we revealed that WWTPs are still an important source of oxygen-depleting organic pollution, despite the extensive technological improvements in wastewater management over several centuries. In general, our findings emphasize the need to take municipal WWTPs into consideration in the management of river basins under the EU Water Framework Directive to achieve good ecological and chemical status for European streams and rivers.

AB Urbanization is a growing threat to ecological communities and has become a leading cause of population extirpations in a wide range of taxa. Because the effects of urbanization are often multifaceted, identifying the pathways through which changes in communities occur has remained a persistent challenge. We draw upon metacommunity theory to evaluate competing explanations for the effects of urbanization, focusing on the relative importance of processes at local (e.g. abiotic and biotic characteristics) and regional (e.g. habitat connectivity and dispersal) scales. Over 4years, we sampled 201 wetlands in the Front Range region of Colorado, which is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the USA. Wetlands embedded within urban areas exhibited significantly lower taxonomic richness and diversity compared to those in agricultural or grassland areas. Relative to grassland wetlands, urban wetlands supported a 60% lower richness of amphibians and aquatic reptiles and a 33% lower richness of aquatic insects, molluscs and crayfish. These patterns were associated with changes in biotic factors (introduced fishes and bullfrogs), abiotic factors (nutrients, conductivity and vegetation) and landscape characteristics (road density and surrounding wetland area). The use of an information-theoretic approach and structural equation modelling suggested that the effects of urbanization on richness were mainly driven by changes in road density. Analyses of community composition indicated that discrete communities formed along the urban systems gradient, such that actively dispersing predators associated more negatively with urban system relative to herbivores with passive dispersal. Synthesis and applications. These results highlight the importance of considering both local and regional factors in addressing conservation-related challenges and underscore the benefits of linking conceptual work on metacommunity theory with applied efforts to mitigate the effects of urbanization.

AB Rivers and floodplains are among the most threatened ecosystems. Hydroelectric power plants and embankments have reduced the hydrological connectivity between rivers and their floodplain channels, leading to loss of freshwater habitats and biological communities. To prevent and reverse such loss, numerous restoration programmes have aimed at rejuvenating the lateral hydrological connectivity between rivers and floodplain channels. Despite considerable global attention, we know remarkably little about the ecological benefits of floodplain restoration programmes. We analysed the functional diversity of different macroinvertebrate groups (natives and aliens) along a gradient of lateral hydrological connectivity on the Rhone river in France. We used 36 sampling sites to describe the functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy) before and after the enhancement of the lateral hydrological connectivity by restoration. The effects of restoration on functional diversity were tested for each macroinvertebrate group and at multiple spatial levels (alpha and beta). Before restoration, alpha functional diversity of the entire macroinvertebrate community peaked in sites with a high lateral connectivity. The contribution of the native groups to functional diversity was higher than that of the alien group. The latter was not constrained by high values of lateral hydrological connectivity and reached a maximum in highly connected sites. After restoration, within-site functional diversity (alpha FD) declined linearly following the enhancement of lateral hydrological connectivity. The restoration operations increased the contribution of the aliens to functional diversity and reduced the contribution of a group of native taxa. In addition, among-sites functional diversity (beta FD) was successfully enlarged by restoration. Synthesis and applications. The lateral hydrological connectivity (LHC) represents a key parameter for explaining the functional diversity (FD) of macroinvertebrates in a floodplain ecosystem. Our results demonstrate that restoration-induced changes to functional diversity can be predicted. Controversially, restoration-induced enhancement of lateral hydrological connectivity increased the functional diversity of the alien macroinvertebrates. However, these species contributed only to a small part of the total macroinvertebrate functional diversity. We recommend that restoration programmes diversify the levels of lateral hydrological connectivity among the channels to ensure an optimal functional diversity at the floodplain scale.

AB Fine sediment is one of the major sources of stream physical and ecological impairment worldwide. We assessed the ecological effects of fine sediment in an otherwise undisturbed catchment (the Isabena, NE Spain). Using data from sites across the catchment we describe the spatial variability and nestedness of invertebrate assemblages and evaluate the effectiveness of compositional (taxon-based) and functional (trait-based) metrics for detecting sediment impacts on these assemblages.
   Invertebrate assemblages were relatively taxon poor and had low densities in those locations with high fine sediment content. Assemblages showed significantly nested patterns, with those in sediment-rich locations consisting of a subset of those in locations with little fine sediment. A number of biological traits appeared to promote this nestedness, particularly those conferring resistance and resilience to fine sediment (polivoltinism, short live cycles and small body sizes).
   Generalised Additive Models indicated that most metrics were able to detect ecological responses to sedimentation. Some taxon-based metrics (%EPT and evenness) performed less well, with values showing only a weak relationship with fine sediment. Results are consistent with previous studies which have highlighted the limitations of taxon-based metrics and suggest that indices of functional diversity are capable of detecting sediment related impairment.
   Overall, the study suggests that fine sediment in the Isabena was selecting for specific life-history traits, and that this selection resulted in clear differences in assemblage structure across the catchment. The use of biological traits in studies of sediment related disturbance may help identify extinction-prone species (e.g. those with univoltine and/or long life-cycles), while trait-based monitoring and assessment metrics, because they reflect the ecological mechanisms underlying observed patterns, should prove useful to help guide management in catchments subjected to excessive fine sediment. More broadly, the study indicates that nestedness in assemblage structure can be driven by local habitat changes, and not only by large scale biogeographical processes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The cost of inbreeding (inbreeding depression, ID) is an important variable in the maintenance of reproductive variation. Ecological interactions such as herbivory could modulate this cost, provided that defence traits harbour deleterious mutations and herbivores are responsible for differences in fitness. In the field, we manipulated the presence of herbivores on experimentally inbred and outcrossed plants of Solanum carolinense (horsenettle) for three-years. Damage was greater on inbred plants, and ID for growth and fitness was significantly greater under herbivory. Inbreeding reduced phenolic expression both qualitatively (phytochemical diversity) and quantitatively, indicating deleterious load at loci related to the biosynthesis of defence compounds. Our results indicate that inbreeding effects on plantherbivore interactions are mediated by changes to functional plant metabolites, suggesting that variation in inbreeding could be a predictor of defence trait variation. The magnitude of herbivore-mediated, ecological ID indicates that herbivores could maintain outcrossing mating systems in nature.

AB Plants are increasingly considered as secondary reservoirs for commensal and pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, but the ecological and functional factors involved in this association are not clear. To address this question, we undertook a comparative approach combining phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses of E.?coli isolates from crops and mammalian hosts. Phenotypic profiling revealed significant differences according to the source of isolation. Notably, isolates from plants displayed higher biofilm and extracellular matrix production and higher frequency of utilization of sucrose and the aromatic compound p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. However, when compared with mammalian-associated strains, they reached lower growth yields on many C-sources commonly used by E.?coli. Strikingly, we observed a strong association between phenotypes and E.?coli phylogenetic groups. Strains belonging to phylogroup B1 were more likely to harbour traits indicative of a higher ability to colonize plants, whereas phylogroup A and B2 isolates displayed phenotypes linked to an animal-associated lifestyle. This work provides clear indications that E.?coli phylogroups are specifically affected by niche-specific selective pressures, and provides an explanation on why E.?coli population structures vary in natural environments, implying that different lineages in E.?coli have substantially different transmission ecology.

AB The assessment of climate change impacts on biodiversity has so far been biased toward the taxonomic identification of the species likely either to benefit from climate modifications or to experience overall declines. There have still been few studies intended to correlate the characteristics of species to their sensitivity to climate change, even though it is now recognized that functional trait-based approaches are promising tools for addressing challenges related to global changes. In this study, two functional indices (originality and uniqueness) were first measured for 35 fish species occurring in French streams. They were then combined to projections of range shifts in response to climate change derived from species distribution models. We set out to investigate: (1) the relationship between the degrees of originality and uniqueness of fish species, and their projected response to future climate change; and (2) the consequences of individual responses of species for the functional diversity of fish assemblages. After accounting for phylogenetic relatedness among species, we have demonstrated that the two indices used measure two complementary facets of the position of fish species in a functional space. We have also rejected the hypothesis that the most original and/or less redundant species would necessarily experience the greatest declines in habitat suitability as a result of climate change. However, individual species range shifts could lead simultaneously both to a severe decline in the functional diversity of fish assemblages, and to an increase in the functional similarity among assemblages, supporting the hypothesis that disturbance favors communities with combination of common traits and biotic homogenization as well. Our findings therefore emphasize the importance of going beyond the simple taxonomic description of diversity to provide a better assessment of the likely future effects of environmental changes on biodiversity, thus helping to design more effective conservation and management measures.

AB Among freshwater bivalves, the brooding of embryos and larvae within the maternal ctenidia is well known. Exceptions to this generalization are the non-brooding freshwater and estuarine species of Dreissena and Mytilopsis, respectively. It was reported that the freshwater troglodytic cousin, Congeria kusceri Bole, 1962, of these dreissenids does not brood either. It is herein demonstrated that C.?kusceri undergoes one reproductive cycle each year. Sexes are separate, with an early male and later female bias. A small percentage (2.14%) of individuals is hermaphroditic. The gonads mature over summer from May to November. Spawning commences in September, when females release mature oocytes into their ctenidia and inhale sperm from mature males. Here the oocytes are fertilized, and develop within interfilamentary marsupia. Ctenidial tissues glandularize, and may provide a source of maternal nutrition for the embryos. At the late prodissoconch-1 or prodissoconch-2 stage (PR2, similar to 220?mu m), larvae are released into the infrabranchial chamber via a birth channel along the outer edge of the ventral marginal food groove of both inner demibranchs. Here, they are brooded further in mantle pouches located beneath the inhalant siphon. Subsequently, after the PR2 stage (nepioconch/dissoconch), they are released from the inhalant siphon and assume an independent life as crawling juveniles. Such juveniles may be found amongst clusters of adults. Not only is C.?kusceri unique amongst the Dreissenidae in possessing the capacity to brood internally fertilized ova, but it is also exceptional amongst the Bivalvia in possessing the described methods of brooding and birth. Explanations for both lie in its troglodytic lifestyle, decadal length longevity and habitat: that of byssal attachment to the hard surfaces of underground freshwater rivers, caves, pits, and sinkholes in the Tethyan arc of the Dinaric karst. Internal fertilization of a few large yolky eggs, lecithotrophic larvae, ctenidial brooding, and secondary pallial parental care represent relatively recent, Late Miocene, evolutionary adaptations from a Tethyan lentic ancestor.

AB A confluence zone in the Upper Parana River Floodplain was sampled to verify the influence of upstream reservoirs on the dispersion and colonisation of phytoplankton. We hypothesized that the dilutive effect and high discharge limit phytoplankton colonisation in the main stem and that the phytoplankton functional structure in floodplain lakes is influenced by upstream reservoirs. The recruitment of functional group (FG) M from Rosana Reservoir was evidenced with low establishment in the main stem and colonisation in the floodplain lake. The lower connectivity with the Parana River during limnophase reflected in water column total mixing and dominance of the FGs C and P in floodplain lake and greater stability of the water column, with dominance of the FG H (1) in a secondary channel. In the potamophase, the Parana River negatively influenced the phytoplankton biovolume in the associated environments. In this period, FG P was dominant in the secondary channel and FG X (2) in the floodplain lake. Our results emphasize that despite the contribution of inocula to the Parana River from the upstream inflow and from tributaries, the phytoplankton depletion was due to retention and seston sedimentation in the Porto Primavera Reservoir, high discharge and dilution in this confluence zone.

AB Functional characteristics play an important role in shaping phytoplankton distributions. This approach can help to explain the success of tropical taxa in temperate ecosystems. We used functional groups (FG) and functional traits (FT) to assess the phytoplankton distribution in five temperate lakes exposed to tropical taxa dispersal. We ran redundancy analyses to assess the relationship between each functional classification and the environment. Both approaches showed similar variance of the phytoplankton biomass and responded to similar environmental variables. The FG approach separated lakes by trophic status (total phosphorus: TP), while the FT approach reflected the lakes' hydromorphology (conductivity, depth, mixing regime). The traits of motility and mixotrophy coincided with low mixing and high light. Tropical taxa were dominant in two lakes, rare in one and absent in two lakes. When dominant, tropical taxa exerted an overwhelming effect on phytoplankton biomass and community composition, and contributed to foam occurrences. The success of tropical taxa in only two lakes seems related to the interplay of their traits (accessory pigments, morphology) and the prevailing environmental filters (low light, deep mixing, and intermediate TP). Their rarity or absence in the other lakes evidences how traits can increase fitness in one environment but not in other.

AB 1. Dam presence is commonly associated with strong accumulation of polluted sediments. In spite of this context of multiple stressors, physical effects are often solely considered in the ecological assessment of the dam impacts. 2. We studied four reservoir/downstream reach systems differing in levels of sediment contamination in reservoirs. Using assemblages and biotrait (i.e. ecological or biological attribute) responses of macroinvertebrate communities and leaf litter breakdown, we examined the individual effects and potential interactions between sediment contamination and dam presence along the gradient of ecotoxic pressure. 3. Leaf breakdown rates ranged from 0.0044 degrees per day in the most contaminated reservoir to 0.0120 degrees per day in the reference reservoir. Comparisons of community trait profiles among reservoirs highlighted a gradient of trait responses to sediment contamination. 4. In the absence of toxic contamination, the dam-induced modifications in biotraits of invertebrate assemblages were not related to a reduction of leaf litter breakdown. Conversely, contaminated sediment in reservoir induced strong functional disturbances (i.e. bioecological shifts and reduction of leaf litter breakdown) downstream of dams. 5. Key biotrait categories positively related to leaf litter breakdown rate have been identified. They corresponded mainly to shredders and/or small-sized (<0.5 cm) insects, using aquatic (e.g. crawlers) or aerial (e.g. fliers) active dispersal strategies. In addition, trait categories positively correlated to contamination level have been considered as response traits. They corresponded to large-sized (>4 cm) species, having several generations per year (polyvoltin), using asexual reproduction and/or disseminating by drift (aquatic, passive). 6. In the current context of ecological continuity restoration, this study has identified the risks associated with the presence of historical contamination in the run-of-river reservoirs for downstream ecosystem health.

AB Freshwater ecosystems have been fragmented by the construction of large numbers of dams. In addition to disruption of ecological continuity and physical disturbance downstream, accumulation of large amounts of sediment within run-of-river reservoirs constitutes a latent ecotoxic risk to aquatic communities. To date, run-of-river reservoirs and ecotoxic risks associated with contaminated sediment to the biodiversity and functioning of such systems are little studied. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to describe macroinvertebrate assemblages, and the functioning of these systems, and to propose indicators of sediment contamination to integrate in in-situ risk assessment methodology. To identify specific assemblages of run-of-river reservoirs, we first compared macroinvertebrate assemblages and their biotrait profiles (i.e. from a database of biological and ecological traits) in reservoirs (n = 6) and associated river sites (upstream and downstream of dams). Then, we compared responses of assemblages and biotrait profiles to sediment contamination of the banks and channels of reservoirs to select the most useful spatial scale to identify sediment contamination. Nineteen indicator taxa were observed to be specifically associated with channel habitats of reservoirs. Among these, the abundance of three taxa (Tanypodinae (Diptera), Ephemerella (Ephemeroptera) and Atherix (Diptera)) revealed the effect of metal sediment contamination. "Between-reservoirs" differences in their biotrait profile were found along the contamination gradient, with a shift of communities' composition and functionality, and an increase in functional similarity. Many traits (response traits), for example "maximum size", "transverse distribution", "substrate preferences", "saprobity", "temperature", "resistance forms", and "locomotion", were specifically linked to contamination of sediments by metals. This study indicates how sediment contamination can change the structural and functional composition of run-of-river reservoir assemblages. Indicator taxa and response traits identified in this study could improve current risk assessment methodology and potentially enable prediction of the risks of contaminated sediments stored in reservoirs in downstream ecosystems.

AB Background: Crocodilians exhibit a spectrum of rostral shape from long snouted (longirostrine), through to short snouted (brevirostrine) morphologies. The proportional length of the mandibular symphysis correlates consistently with rostral shape, forming as much as 50% of the mandible's length in longirostrine forms, but 10% in brevirostrine crocodilians. Here we analyse the structural consequences of an elongate mandibular symphysis in relation to feeding behaviours.
   Methods/Principal Findings: Simple beam and high resolution Finite Element (FE) models of seven species of crocodile were analysed under loads simulating biting, shaking and twisting. Using beam theory, we statistically compared multiple hypotheses of which morphological variables should control the biomechanical response. Brevi- and mesorostrine morphologies were found to consistently outperform longirostrine types when subject to equivalent biting, shaking and twisting loads. The best predictors of performance for biting and twisting loads in FE models were overall length and symphyseal length respectively; for shaking loads symphyseal length and a multivariate measurement of shape (PC1 - which is strongly but not exclusively correlated with symphyseal length) were equally good predictors. Linear measurements were better predictors than multivariate measurements of shape in biting and twisting loads. For both biting and shaking loads but not for twisting, simple beam models agree with best performance predictors in FE models.
   Conclusions/Significance: Combining beam and FE modelling allows a priori hypotheses about the importance of morphological traits on biomechanics to be statistically tested. Short mandibular symphyses perform well under loads used for feeding upon large prey, but elongate symphyses incur high strains under equivalent loads, underlining the structural constraints to prey size in the longirostrine morphotype. The biomechanics of the crocodilian mandible are largely consistent with beam theory and can be predicted from simple morphological measurements, suggesting that crocodilians are a useful model for investigating the palaeobiomechanics of other aquatic tetrapods.

AB The life cycle research of the past years has revealed an unexpectedly high diversity of reproduction and survival strategies. Dinoflagellate life cycles often seem to be plastic, i.e. different pathways and mechanisms may be complementary in one and the same species. The diversity of life cycle stages, strategies and regulation mechanisms will have implications for the understanding of ecological processes and functions. Versatility in reproduction and survival strategies will affect genetic diversity patterns and standing genetic variation which are important factors in adaptation to changing conditions and stability against environmental disturbance. Complex regulation mechanisms and multiple cues for life cycle transformations can lead to differences in the magnitude of cyst formation and sedimentation and thereby determine the fate of primary production. Life cycles are an important life history trait of dinofiagellates which, in their versatility and complexity, contribute to the functional diversity that structures and determines the functioning of aquatic systems.

AB Coral reef fishes represent one of the most spectacularly diverse assemblages of vertebrates on the planet, but our understanding of their mode of diversification remains limited. Here we test whether the diversity of the damselfishes (Pomacentridae), one of the most species-rich families of reef-associated fishes, was produced by a single or multiple adaptive radiation(s) during their evolutionary history. Tests of the tempo of lineage diversification using a time-calibrated phylogeny including 208 species revealed that crown pomacentrid diversification has not slowed through time as expected under a scenario of a single adaptive radiation resulting from an early burst of diversification. Evolutionary modeling of trophic traits similarly rejected the hypothesis of early among-lineage partitioning of ecologically important phenotypic diversity. Instead, damselfishes are shown to have experienced iterative convergent radiations wherein subclades radiate across similar trophic strategies (i.e., pelagic feeders, benthic feeders, intermediate) and morphologies. Regionalization of coral reefs, competition, and functional constraints may have fueled iterative ecological radiation and convergent evolution of damselfishes. Through the Pomacentridae, we illustrate that radiations may be strongly structured by the nature of the constraints on diversification.

AB Over the last few decades, molecular methods have vastly improved our ability to study the diversity of microbial communities. In molecular diversity surveys, the function of protists is often inferred from phylogeny. Yet these surveys are unable to distinguish between different trophic modes among closely related taxa. Here we present results from a culture-independent study linking bacterivory to the diversity of pelagic protists from 3 depths of a stratified mesotrophic lake. Bacteria were labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and added to lakewater samples; after incubation, total DNA was extracted from filtered samples. Part of the DNA extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-BrdU antibodies, and then both whole DNA and BrdU-labeled samples were analyzed using 454-pyrosequencing of the v9 region of 18S small subunit rRNA gene amplicons. The results show that a different community of protists exists at each depth, with limited overlap of taxonomic composition between depths. The community of BrdU-labeled protists, deemed putative bacterivores, is largely a subset of the community found in the whole DNA samples. Many of these BrdU-labeled taxa are poorly represented in GenBank and thus are probably rarely isolated and/or uncultured species. Several of the taxa identified as bacterivores are also phototrophs, highlighting the important role of mixotrophy among eukaryotic microbes. Definitive identity of functional traits among taxa requires careful experimentation, yet this method allows a first-pass assay of the trophic role of microbial eukaryotes from environmental samples.

AB In order to detect shifts in community structure and function associated with global change, the natural background fluctuation in these traits must be known. In a 6 yr study we characterized the composition of young benthic communities at 7 sites along the 300 km coast of the Kiel and Lubeck bights in the German Baltic Sea and we quantified their interannual variability of taxonomic and functional composition.
   Along the salinity gradient from NW to SE, the relative abundance of primary producers decreased while that of heterotrophs increased. Along the same gradient, annual productivity tended to increase. Taxonomic and functional richness were higher in Kiel Bight as compared to Lubeck Bight. With increasing species richness functional group richness showed saturation indicating an increasing functional redundancy in species rich communities.
   While taxonomic fluctuations between years were substantial, functionality of the communities seem preserved in most cases. Environmental conditions potentially driving these fluctuations are winter temperatures and current regimes. We tentatively define a confidence range of natural variability in taxonomic and functional composition a departure from which might help identifying an ongoing regime shift driven by global change. In addition, we propose to use RELATE, a statistical procedure in the PRIMER (Plymouth Routines in Multivariate Ecological Research) package to distinguish directional shifts in time ("signal") from natural temporal fluctuations ("noise").

AB Despite recent trends in using plant functional traits to describe ecosystem responses to environmental change, few studies have examined the capacity of traits to represent environmental variation for individual species at small spatial scales, such as across forest edges. We examined the utility of 12 easy-to-measure leaf traits (fresh weight to dry weight ratio, specific leaf area (SLA), osmolality, delta C-13, delta N-15, and concentrations of key nutrients) to detect edge effects on the function of a dominant woodland tree, Eucalyptus arenacea Marginson & Ladiges. The study included replicate E. arenacea trees at the woodland edge (0 m) and interior (75 m from edge) of three woodlands adjoined by pasture and three woodlands adjoined by plantation established on pasture. Leaf traits proved useful in identifying potentially degrading processes at woodland edges. Notably, greater leaf P concentrations and delta N-15 in edge than interior trees irrespective of edge type (pasture versus plantation) indicated persistent effects of nutrient enrichment from agricultural practices; and leaf osmolality and Na concentrations indicated greatest exposure of woodland trees to salinity at pasture edges. Nonetheless, leaf traits proved less useful in detecting edge effects on tree physiology, with most traits being non-responsive to a pronounced interactive effect of edge type and distance from edge on physiological measures. In addition, negative correlations between SLA and physiological measures of tree productivity were contrary to global relationships. Overall, we found that although particular leaf traits indicated potentially degrading processes of nutrient enrichment and salinisation, they were not reliable indicators of small-scale edge effects on the physiological function of E. arenacea.

AB The main aim of this study was to compare Grime's strategies in 91 plant taxa occurring from the eastern to the western part of the central Black Sea region of northern Turkey (Samsun). To do this, 45 sample plots were taken from different community types (from swamp forests to halophytic communities), and the strategies of plant species were compared with each other. Many tree and shrub species present in Hac1 Osman Forest, a protected swamp forest, exhibited a purely competitive (C) strategy; some other tree and shrub species exhibited secondary strategies such as competitive/competitive stress-tolerant (C/CS) and competitive/competitive ruderal (C/CR). The ecological features of Hac1 Osman Forest and Galeric Forest are similar, and species of either forest tended to adopt stress-tolerant strategies. Coastal dune species within the study area exhibited transient strategies. Finally, it was evaluated that the CSR classification model can be successfully applied to determine the responses of plant species to changing land use patterns and disturbance factors, even for woody shrub and tree species, although our data were not entirely consistent with Grime's succession theory

AB The present paper examines the functional diversity-environment relation in a placer rich tropical bay. Understanding the environmental variables that determine the biodiversity pattern will help in the effective conservation plans of coastal habitat. However, few studies have been carried out on the biodiversity-environment relation from the diverse tropical coastal ecosystem. The geographic location of Kalbadevi Bay along the west coast of India provides an opportunity to study the functional diversity pattern of macrofauna along an environmental gradient. Additionally, the area is also a potential placer mining site. Seasonal sampling was carried out for macrofauna and environmental variables. Macrofaunal functional diversity showed significant temporal variation related to the environmental parameters. The most important environmental variables were organic matter and sediment texture. Filter feeders dominated during postmonsoon which is a period when the water column is enriched with sinking detritus. The deposit feeders which rapidly ingest the settled detritus and also transport it to deeper sediment for the subsurface deposit feeders dominated during premonsoon. Abundance of carnivores was high during premonsoon, a response to increase in food in terms of deposit feeders. The result thus indicates that the temporal environmental variation influenced the macrofaunal functional diversity pattern in the Kalbadevi Bay.

AB Species-specific traits are relevant to understand variation in the effect of grazers on primary producers and are critical in determining their functional roles as controllers of productivity in marine ecosystems. In intertidal habitats, periphyton, composed of bacteria, cyanophytes, microalgae and early stages of macroalgae, constitutes the main food for many benthic grazers. Using field experiments, we examined the overall effect of grazers and the importance of direct and indirect effects of different grazer species on periphyton composition, richness, diversity and productivity. We manipulated the main grazer species present along Chilean rocky shores, en closing adult individuals of the keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa, the chiton Chiton granosus, the scurrinid limpet Scurria araucana and the pulmonate limpet Siphonaria lessoni. These organisms overlap broadly in diet but exhibit differences in foraging behavior. Differences in the individual effects of grazer species on periphyton productivity, as well as on richness and diversity characterized the assemblage. C. granosus grazing led to lower periphyton productivity, richness and diversity compared with all other grazers, who had positive effects for all variables. Richness and diversity of the major periphyton groups were maximal at intermediate levels of total grazing pressure, highlighting the importance of ecological interactions within the periphyton assemblage. Our results demonstrate the complexity of functional roles and relationships of grazers involved in the control of composition and production of the periphyton assemblage. Given the importance of direct and indirect effects of grazers, understanding species interactions within the microbenthic community can shed light on the mechanisms through which herbivores modify community structure and productivity.

AB The relation between biological diversity and ecosystem functioning is a central theme in ecology. Ecological traits of species are often regarded as a link between structure and function, and trait distributions in a community may change in response to environmental stressors. Likewise, resilience in a community may be derived from the diversity in traits and trait values relevant to a particular stressor. We combine two approaches to test this: a novel trait frequency analysis and a multivariate ordination approach. The two methods are applied on a case study of an earthworm community in a frequently flooded floodplain in the Netherlands. Periodic flooding in floodplains restricts population growth and recolonization of earthworms. The strategies employed by different earthworm species for coping with this stress can be described by a combination of ecological traits. From the literature we compiled 10 ecological traits for the earthworm species encountered along an inundation gradient in the Duursche Waarden floodplain area flanking the river IJssel. Trait frequency analysis showed a greater diversity at low elevation sites of traits considered to be associated to flood tolerance, suggesting greater community resilience to flooding. The ordination analysis using trait composition provided information on which trait classes in the community were related with the inundation stress. Results from both analyses showed that important traits in species to deal with flooding are active dispersal, high hydrophily, diapause and parthenogenetic reproduction. Thus, a further understanding of community resilience was gained by combining traditional ordination analysis with trait diversity analysis.

AB Silicon is described as beneficial for grasses by enhancing yield and fitness via a considerable contribution to pathogen, drought, and pest resistance. Silicic acid is the predominant form for uptake and transport within the plant and will precipitate in leaves. But it is unknown whether polymeric nanosilicon compounds in its synthetic form, with an increasing concentration in aquatic environments, can be suitable for plant nutrition. Therefore, we investigated the uptake, transport, and deposition of silicic acid/silica within plants using synthetic nanosilica. Our results show a significant difference in silicon (Si) content within the different tissues of Phragmites australis. The nanosilica had been dissolved prior to the uptake by plants. The chemical form of Si during uptake was not traceable. A significant enhancement in the condensation state of the silica was found from root to leaves especially from culm to leaf tips visible by the increasing content of Q(4)-groups in the NMR spectra. We conclude that synthetic nanosilica has the same quality as source for the beneficial element Si like natural silica. Since the condensation state is described to control silica solubility, we suggest that different condensation states within the plant may result in different remobilization of silicon during decomposition of the plant material.

AB There is a recognized need to design a new framework for sediment toxicity testing that meets current scientific standards and regulatory requirements, such as reliable assessment of toxicity, which prevents any harmful effects on biodiversity, a strong capability to predict population- and community-level effects, and applicability of the results to decision-making. We propose a new framework for prospective sediment toxicity testing, and suggest solutions to the key methodological challenges that hinder establishment of this framework (comparison of sensitivities, design of test batteries, consideration of different exposure routes, extrapolations to population and community levels, use of test results for decision-making). The proposed framework consists of the following three units: test-battery system, higher-tier testing systems and additional ecological modeling, and a decision support system. The key methodologies proposed to establish this framework are compound-tailored test-battery use approach, relative sensitivity distribution analysis, toxicity tests that combine bacteria and arthropods, micro- and mesocosms studies, population and community models, and model-driven decision support systems. The proposed framework, as well as the key methods mentioned above, has the potential to improve not only prospective toxicity testing for sediments, but also ecological risk assessment in general.

AB The geometric shape is traditionally used to calculate phytoplankton cell measurements (e.g. biovolume), but it can also play an important role in determining community distributions. Little is known about how geometric shapes relate to other morphological traits or to the environment. We explored whether shapes and related morphological traits are selected by environmental forcing. For this, samples were collected seasonally at 21 stations in coastal-marine waters of the Salento Peninsula (Italy). Phytoplankton taxa were classified in terms of geometric shape, biovolume (organism size) and surface-to-volume ratio (S:V). The relationship between greatest axial linear dimension (GALD) and S:V was assessed for each shape. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was performed to evaluate phytoplankton shape distribution on temporal and spatial scales. Phytoplankton community was characterized by high morphological diversity. GALD and S:V were inversely related in most of the shapes. CCA showed that phytoplankton shape distribution was influenced more by seasonal than by spatial variation: elongated shapes characterized the cold period; rounded and combined shapes the warmer period. Most of the shapes showed conservatism of the S:V and trade-off with the size. Geometric shapes represent an interesting feature to be considered in trait-based approaches to study phytoplankton distributions in aquatic ecosystems.

AB The Antarctic marine environment is extreme in its low temperatures and short periods of primary productivity. Invertebrates must therefore adapt to maximise reproductive output where low temperature and limited food slow larval development. Brooding is a common reproductive trait in Antarctic marine bivalves; larval development occurs within the mantle cavity, and larvae are released as fully developed young. Lissarca miliaris is a small, short-lived, shallow-water brooding bivalve of circum-Antarctic distribution and found most abundant in the sub-Antarctic Magellan Region and islands of the Scotia Arc. Here, an unusual hermaphrodite reproductive trait is described for L. miliaris from King George Island (62A degrees 14'S, 58A degrees 38'W) and Signy Island (60A degrees 42'S, 45A degrees 36'W), Antarctica, using histological and dissection techniques. Specimens demonstrate simultaneous and sequential hermaphrodite traits; male and female gonads develop simultaneously, but the production of oocytes is reduced while testes are ripe. Functional females are more abundant in specimens above 3 mm shell length, although male reproductive tissue persists and functional males are found in all size classes. The number of previtellogenic oocytes produced by far exceeds the number of oocytes extruded and brooded, which may indicate an ancestral link to a planktotrophic past. Hermaphroditism in L. miliaris maximises reproductive efficiency in a short-lived species, in which the female's capacity to brood its young is limited, and demonstrates a specialised adaptation to a cold stenothermal and food-limited environment prevailing in the Southern Ocean.

AB Background: Phenotypic evolution may occur through mutations that affect either the structure or expression of protein-coding genes. Although the evolution of color vision has historically been attributed to structural mutations within the opsin genes, recent research has shown that opsin regulatory mutations can also tune photoreceptor sensitivity and color vision. Visual sensitivity in African cichlid fishes varies as a result of the differential expression of seven opsin genes. We crossed cichlid species that express different opsin gene sets and scanned their genome for expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) responsible for these differences. Our results shed light on the role that different structural, cis-, and trans-regulatory mutations play in the evolution of color vision.
   Results: We identified 11 eQTL that contribute to the divergent expression of five opsin genes. On three linkage groups, several eQTL formed regulatory "hotspots" associated with the expression of multiple opsins. Importantly, however, the majority of the eQTL we identified (8/11 or 73%) occur on linkage groups located trans to the opsin genes, suggesting that cichlid color vision has evolved primarily via trans-regulatory divergence. By modeling the impact of just two of these trans-regulatory eQTL, we show that opsin regulatory mutations can alter cichlid photoreceptor sensitivity and color vision at least as much as opsin structural mutations can.
   Conclusions: Combined with previous work, we demonstrate that the evolution of cichlid color vision results from the interplay of structural, cis-, and especially trans-regulatory loci. Although there are numerous examples of structural and cis-regulatory mutations that contribute to phenotypic evolution, our results suggest that trans-regulatory mutations could contribute to phenotypic divergence more commonly than previously expected, especially in systems like color vision, where compensatory changes in the expression of multiple genes are required in order to produce functional phenotypes.

AB Gaining understanding of food-web processes often requires a simplified representation of natural diversity. One such simplification can be based on functional traits, as functionally similar species may provide a similar contribution to ecosystem level-processes. However, understanding how similarity in functional traits actually translates into similar contributions to ecosystem-level properties remains a challenge due to the complex ways in which traits can influence species' dynamics. Moreover, in many communities, seasonality alters the abiotic and biotic forcing regime, causing ongoing changes to patterns of species' dominance; groups of species do not stay intact but are rather continuously subjected to changes throughout the year. Using long-term high frequency measurements of phytoplankton in Lake Constance, we investigated the effect of seasonal changes on the relationship between functional similarity and temporal dynamics similarity of 36 morphotypes, and the relative contribution of different functional traits during the different parts of the year. Our results revealed seasonal differences in the overall degree of synchronization of morphotypes' temporal dynamics and how combinations of functional traits influence the relationship between functional trait similarity and temporal dynamics similarity, showing that different forcing regimes change how species cope with their environment based on their functional traits. Moreover, we show that the individual functional traits matter at different periods of the year indicating that species which are dynamically similar at certain parts of the year may not be at others. The differential strength of the overall and individual impact of functional traits on species' temporal dynamics makes the cohesion of a pair of functionally similar species dependent on the different forcing. Hence, simplifying food webs based solely on functional traits may not provide consistent estimates of functional groups over all seasons.

AB Perennial pans are a common feature of the Mpumalanga Highveld in South Africa and are increasingly under threat from mining and agricultural activities. Pans are endorheic wetlands that can be perennial or ephemeral in nature. They are widespread in arid and semi-arid regions throughout the world. Although phyllopod crustaceans dominate pan communities in arid regions, the invertebrate communities of perennial pans have not been well studied. The aim of the current research was to characterise the invertebrate communities of several pans (both natural and impaired). A combination of taxonomic and functional approaches was followed to study these communities. The macroinvertebrate species diversity of the pans was comparable to similar ecosystems in southern Africa and other parts of the world. Results indicate large spatial and temporal variations in diversity. This variation became less obvious when the analysis was based on biological traits. It was also evident that both coal mining and agricultural activities had an impact on the aquatic invertebrate community structures. These changes were apparent in both the diversity and the biological traits of the invertebrate communities of adjacent pans.

AB MicroRNA (miRNA) are a class of small, single-stranded, non-coding RNA that regulate mRNA expression at the post-transcriptional level and play important roles in many fundamental biological processes. There is emerging evidence that miRNA are critical regulators of widespread cellular functions, such as differentiation, proliferation, and migration. At present, little is known about miRNA expression profiles related to skeletal muscle growth in aquatic organisms. This study aimed to investigate the phenotypic variation in the body growth of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and to identify and quantify the differential expression levels of selected growth-related transcriptomic miRNA in the skeletal muscle of this fish. To this end, we performed next-generation sequencing to define the full miRNA transcriptome in muscle tissue from Nile tilapia and to detect differentially expressed miRNA between 2 strains of Nile tilapia. These tilapia strains exhibited significant (P < 0.05) phenotypic variation with respect to growth-related traits (body length and BW), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype diversity, and the differential expression of selected growth-related genes. The results obtained from the transcriptome analysis and real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed significant differences in miRNA expression between fast-growing and control strains of tilapia. Digital gene expression (DGE) profiling was performed based on the obtained read abundance, and we identified down-regulated miRNA, including let-7j, miR-140, miR-192, miR-204, miR-218a, miR-218b, miR-301c, and miR-460, and up-regulated miRNA, including let-7b, let-7c, miR-133, miR-152, miR-15a, miR-193a, miR-30b, and miR-34, associated with body growth in tilapia. These results were further validated using real-time qRT-PCR and microarray profiling. In summary, the up-and down-regulation of miRNA involved in the GH/IGF-1 axis signaling pathway suggests that the differential expression levels of growth-related miRNA may serve as molecular markers that are predictive of specific functional and diagnostic implications. The obtained data on genetic polymorphisms in miRNA-target interactions are particularly useful for Nile tilapia breeding programs.

AB Floodplains are characterized by high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Despite low active mobility, Central European floodplain gastropod communities show a high species diversity. They are supposed to have developed a large range of resistance and/or resilience strategies to survive in the highly variable and frequently disturbed floodplain habitats. Relating gastropod diversity and species traits to hydrological conditions, we tested how different groundwater and flood regimes affect gastropod diversity and identified the main species traits favouring their survival in highly dynamic floodplain grasslands. Species richness, species diversity and functional diversity peaked at intermediate flood disturbance and moisture levels. Harsher environmental conditions in either dryer or frequently flooded habitats restricted the gastropod communities to a few specialized species. Morphological and life-history traits showed significant variations along the hydrological gradient. Shell character and mode of reproduction proved to be important functional determinants for gastropod community composition. Species with strongly calcified shells, which limit the risk of injuries in case of dislodgment, were more often found in flood prone sites. Uniparental reproduction dominated in the driest as well as in highly flood-disturbed habitats, providing reproductive assurance where harsh environmental conditions may reduce the number of potential mates. Intermediate disturbance and moisture levels favoured local gastropod diversity whereas dryer or highly flood-disturbed habitats sheltered specialized species. Therefore, the maintenance of areas with different disturbance and moisture levels is of major importance in favouring taxonomical and functional mollusc diversity across the whole floodplain.

AB Studies focusing on the linkage between numerical and functional trait diversity frequently consider functional diversity indices but rarely evaluate them empirically or evaluate the use of other than continuous traits such as body size. Here, we present an extensive compilation on functional knowledge of benthic macrofauna using the categorical trait approach and scores of both common and rare species for 25 biological traits, including 102 modalities. We empirically quantify functional trait richness, within-trait species richness (redundancy), and trait variability on a large regional scale (>1000 km), in three environmentally different areas (basins of a sea), over a long time-span (10 years). To develop further the usage of multiple categorical traits as an analysis tool, we examine the effect of sampling effort for the understanding of the functional properties of the benthic meta-assemblages. We also evaluate the relationship between species richness and trait richness in order to understand co-variation between trait modalities and how traits are packaged within species. Results show that the biological diversity in terms of traits could be distinguished between areas of higher and lower salinity, higher and lower anthropogenic stress, and higher and lower species richness. A considerably lower number of samples are needed to portray the functional structure of an area in relation to the taxonomic structure, thereby demonstrating the advantage of using traits when considering management and conservation issues. Using categorical traits empirically requires, as shown within this study, an understanding of the relationship between species richness and expression of traits, co-variation of traits at different species richness and composition levels, acknowledgment of differences in trait expressions between common and rare species, and variability in abundance of species. Empirical trait-based analysis can reveal large-scale differences and insights into complexities between assemblage structure and function, and simultaneously be a valid tool for finding generalities.

AB Much is known about invertebrate community traits in basins across Europe, but no comprehensive description of traits exists for the continental US. Little is known about the trait composition of invertebrates in reference or least-disturbed basins of the US, how trait composition varies among ecoregions, or how consistently traits respond to land use. These elements are essential to development of trait-based tools for conservation and assessment of biological integrity. We compared invertebrate traits of least-disturbed basins among ecoregions of the US. Benthic invertebrate data (presence/absence) from 1987 basins were translated into 56 binary traits (e.g., bivoltine, clinger). Basins were classified as least-disturbed, agricultural, or urban, and grouped into 9 ecoregions. Landuse, climatic, physiographic, and hydrologic data were used to describe ecoregions and to evaluate least-disturbed basin quality. The unique habitat template of each ecoregion selected for trait compositions in least-disturbed basins that differed among ecoregions. Among the traits examined, life-history (e.g., voltinism, development) and ecological traits (e.g., rheophily, thermal preference) differed most among ecoregions. Agricultural and urban land uses selected for trait compositions that differed from least-disturbed, but the extent of the differences depended on ecoregion and quality of the least-disturbed basins. No trait compositions unique to specific land uses were found. However, a disturbance syndrome was observed in that the magnitude and direction of trait responses to urban and agricultural land uses were consistent among ecoregions. Each ecoregion had a unique trait composition, but trait compositions could be used to aggregate ecoregions into 3 broad regions: Western Mountains, Plains and Lowlands, and Eastern Highlands. Our results indicate that large-scale trait-based assessment tools for the US will require calibration to account for regional differences in the trait composition of basins and in the quality of least-disturbed basins.

AB Understanding models of networks formation is fundamental to explore the role of the structure in the functioning of the systems they describe, and their ability to respond to change. In this work, we aimed to understand whether and how the modular (or compartmented) structure of a network composed by macroinvertebrates and leaf detritus in six pools of aquatic system was related with the decomposition process. First, we evaluated the relationship between the temporal patterns of leaf detritus colonization and the modular subdivision of the network. Modularity was then related with the clustering of the pools based on convergent traits of leaf detritus consumption and environmental conditions. A significant relationship between the colonization patterns and the distribution of taxa and pools in well-defined modules was found. The modular and clustering subdivision of the pools showed a significant overlap, which revealed the intimate linkage between the structure and functioning of the system. Modularity shapes the functional architecture of the network, by increasing the spatial differences of leaf litter decomposition over time and the diversity of functional traits among detritus feeder. As a consequence, modularity influences the variability of communities' responses to disturbance, increasing the diversity and robustness of functional processes. Our results have also implications from a conservation point of view, showing the importance of habitat heterogeneity for the robustness of ecosystem functioning, potentially enhancing biodiversity with positive, long-term effect on the whole food web.

AB Intense harvesting and slash fires during the late 1800s and early 1900s led to homogenization throughout the Great Lakes region via the conversion from tamarack, pine, and spruce forests to aspen forests, which are supported by the forest products industry. Subsequently, mesophication occurred in the eastern United States due to fire suppression, transforming oak woodlands to mixed mesophytic forests. We explored both homogenization and mesophication at a regional scale by quantifying changes in community composition and density between historical General Land Office survey points and current USDA Forest Analysis and Inventory plots for Minnesota's Laurentian Mixed and Eastern Broadleaf Forest provinces. We used the Morisita plotless density estimator and applied corrections for surveyor bias to estimate density for historical forests and we used known densities of FIA plots to predict current densities with random forests, an ensemble regression tree method, and terrain and soil predictor variables. Of the 43 ecological units used in the analysis, only one current community was similar to its historical counterpart. Within the Laurentian Mixed Forest province, forest density of primarily mature aspen stands is reduced slightly today compared to the tamarack-dominated forests of the past. Conversely, in the Eastern Broadleaf Forest province, forest densities have increased compared to historical pine and oak woodlands, due to increases of densely growing, fire-sensitive species. Ordinations of functional traits and structure showed substantial changes between current and historical communities as well as reduced differentiation among current communities compared to their historical counterparts. Homogenization in the Laurentian Mixed Forest is occurring by transition from early-successional to late-successional species, with associated changes in forest ecosystems, and homogenization and mesophication in the Eastern Broadleaf Forest are occurring by transition from disturbance-stabilized genera of open forest ecosystems to non-disturbance-dependent genera of dense forests. Despite different starting points of historical forest ecosystems in the Laurentian Mixed Forest and Eastern Broadleaf Forest, we found homogenization and mesophication to be interrelated in the convergence of composition and densities along a common trajectory to dense forests composed of late-successional species in Minnesota.

DT Article
DE Life history traits; Habitat templet hypothesis; RLQ analysis;
   Fourth-corner analysis
AB Despite an increasing interest in the study of functional diversity, there have been no attempts to link aquatic insect traits, habitat variations, and community structure in subtropical Asian streams. We examined relationships between habitat characteristics and aquatic insect traits at 7 sites along a subtropical stream in Taiwan by an RLQ analysis and fourth-corner analysis. The habitat was described by the slope, mineral substrate size, and water chemistry, while aquatic insect traits were described using 40 categories of 9 functional traits. The 1st axis of the RLQ analysis explained 96.5%, suggesting a strong longitudinal environmental gradient structuring the characteristics of sites and aquatic insect assemblages. The most influential habitat variables were the slope, mineral substrate size, conductivity, and alkalinity, which reflected both natural variations and human impacts along the stream. The main covariations between traits and habitat were a shift from organisms with combining features, such as crawlers, a large body size, a flat body form, and low body flexibility to organisms which are swimmers, possess high body flexibility and a small body size, and feed on fine detritus and microinvertebrates. In the results of the fourth-corner analysis, 18 of 40 trait categories were significantly correlated with environmental variables. In particular, traits relating to flow, such as body form, attachment to substrate, body flexibility, and food type, showed the strongest correlations with environmental variables. Longitudinal gradients of aquatic insect assemblages corresponded to a gradual shift from aquatic insects that preferred larger and more stable mineral substrates (rubble) to those that preferred still waters in lowlands with finer substrates. The results suggested that the low substrate heterogeneity and stability at downstream sites led to a simpler but less stable functional organization, and that functional traits should be sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in environmental variables and can be used for biomonitoring streams in Taiwan.

AB This study aimed to compare the intensity and the sensitivity of the responses of four river biological quality elements (BQEs) - macrophytes, fish, diatoms and macroinvertebrates - to human pressures excluding natural variations in stream ecosystem functioning. Biological, water quality and hydro-morphological data were compiled for 290 French river sites.
   Out of the 93 metrics tested, 51 covering the four BQEs responded significantly to global degradation. The responses to specific pressures were consistent with the BQEs' ecological and biological characteristics. For the four BQEs, metrics responded strongly to water quality degradations. Like fish, macroinvertebrate metrics were very sensitive to morphological degradations such as the presence of an impoundment, while diatom and macrophyte metrics did not show strong responses to these changes. Among the four BQEs' metrics, fish metrics responded the strongest to hydrological perturbations. Although a high proportion of the metrics responded only to high levels of human-induced degradations, trait-based metrics seemed the most sensitive and responded to lower levels of pressure. Global and water quality degradations of the river appear to be better detected by BQE metrics than channel morphological and hydrological degradations. Our results highlight the different impacts of human-induced pressures on the four BQE metrics and the challenging task of assessing the effect of single pressures when most of sites are multi-impacted.

AB There is a long tradition of river monitoring using taxonomy-based metrics to assess environmental quality in Europe via benthic macroinvertebrate communities. A promising alternative is the use of their species life-history traits. Both methods (taxonomy-based and trait-based), however, have relied on the time-consuming identification of taxa. River biotopes, (i.e. 1-100 m(2) 'habitats' with associated species assemblages), have long been seen as a useful and meaningful way of linking the ecology of macroinvertebrates and river hydro-morphology and can be used to assess hydro-morphological degradation in rivers. However, between-river taxonomic differences, especially at large spatial scale, had prevented a general test of this concept until now. The species trait approach may overcome this obstacle across broad geographical areas, using biotopes as the hydro-morphological units which have characteristic species trait assemblages. We collected macroinvertebrate data from discrete 512 patches, comprising 13 river biotopes, from seven rivers in England and Wales. The aim was to test whether river biotopes were better predictors of macroinvertebrate trait profiles than taxonomic composition (genera, families, orders) in rivers, independently of the phylogenetic effects and catchment scale characteristics (i.e. hydrology, geography and land cover). We also tested whether species richness and diversity were better related to biotopes than to rivers. River biotopes explained 40% of the variance in macroinvertebrate trait profiles across the rivers, largely independently of catchment characteristics. There was a strong phylogenetic signature, however. River biotopes were better at predicting macroinvertebrate trait profiles than taxonomic composition across rivers, whatever the taxonomic resolution. River biotopes were better than river identity at explaining the variability in taxonomic richness and diversity (40% and <= 10%, respectively). Detailed trait-biotope associations agreed with independent a priori predictions relating trait categories to near river bed flows. Hence, species traits provided a much needed mechanistic understanding and predictive ability across a broad geographical area. We show that integration of the multiple biological trait approach with river biotopes at the interface between ecology and hydro-morphology provides a wealth of new information and potential applications for river science and management.

AB Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) is a recently proposed method for addressing ecological functioning based on traits exhibited by members of biological assemblages. This multi-trait approach was applied to the soft-bottom subtidal macrobenthic communities of the Mondego estuary (Portugal), aiming to assess its functioning following a management measure implemented in this system. In particular, the response of benthic assemblages to restoration efforts was investigated over a 5-year period, testing for temporal differences before and after management, in order to assess the effectiveness of this recovery action.
   BTA revealed to be a useful approach providing valuable information on the functioning of the subtidal benthic communities. Overall, results suggested that there have been some changes in the ecosystem over the study period, although the success of the management measure at the benthic functional level revealed unclear. The climatic variability experienced in the estuary over the monitoring period seemed to have played a significant role in masking the potential effects of restoration. Furthermore, evidence suggested a possible persistence in the benthic functioning despite the occurrence of shifts in taxonomic composition, assured by the potential ability of different species with an alike set of traits to perform similar roles in the ecosystem.
   To best of our knowledge, this study constituted one of the first attempts to investigate the effects of a management measure in an estuary by means of Biological Traits Analysis. As such, it can thus be useful as a guideline for further management actions in the Mondego estuary extendable to other poikilohaline estuaries as well, and to provide insights on the BTA application to this type of ecosystems.

AB The ecological consequences of freshwater land-based salmonid farms on rivers were studied by monitoring eight farms with substantial differences in annual trout production (29-368 t year(-1)) connected to rivers of contrasted hydrology (mean annual discharge ranging from 0.3 to 4.8 m(3) s(-1)) in France. Samples of water and benthic invertebrates were collected in the river immediately upstream and at two locations downstream of fish farm outlets during low flow period in summer. Suspended solids, PO43- and NH4+ concentrations increased downstream of the outlets, suggesting that fish food-derived wastes led to a dilute mixture of suspended solids and dissolved nutrients. The total abundance of benthic invertebrates consistently increased immediately downstream of the effluent outlets, and a positive correlation was observed with the biomass of fish in the aquaculture facilities at the sampling date. The proportions of oligochaetes and chironomids increased downstream of the farms and, conversely, proportions of ephemeropterans, plecopterans and trichopterans decreased. Similarly, the relative abundances of shredders and scrapers decreased in the benthic invertebrate community downstream of the outlets, whereas deposit-feeders and filter feeders increased. This consistent pattern outlined a major change in the ecosystem functioning, with particulate organic matter from fish food-derived wastes becoming a central source of energy in river benthic food webs. Furthermore, the taxonomic-based ecological indicator usually used for monitoring biotic integrity in French Rivers overlooked these functional impairments in larger streams (mean annual discharge above 2 m(3) s(-1)). This study outlines the interest of using benthic invertebrate functional feeding groups together with the results of water chemistry analyses for monitoring the ecological disturbances induced by land-based salmonid farm effluents in running waters.

AB In the present study, biological traits analysis (BTA) was used to explore and characterise effects of pollution on functional attributes of soft bottom infaunal species assemblages. The data comprised 38 sampling stations in the Oslofjord, Norway, ranging from heavily polluted to minimally impacted areas. At each station, species composition (113 taxa in total), contaminants (cadmium, mercury, lead, DDT, PCB) and sediment parameters were determined. Species functions were analysed for eight biological traits defined for activity and life history features. Traits were scored according to the fuzzy coding technique. The most distinct patterns were shown for mobility, size, sediment dwelling depth, feeding type and larval development in relation to contaminants, sediment physical structure and sediment oxidation status. At high levels of contaminants, particularly cadmium, features such as shallow sediment dwelling depth, small size, subsurface deposit feeding and lecitotroph larval development prevailed, while at low contaminant levels characteristic features included deeper sediment dwelling depth, larger size, surface deposit feeding and permanent attachment. Deep sediment dwelling depth (>15 cm) was related to minimally contaminated oxidised sediments at greater water depths. Mobility and carnivorous feeding prevailed in coarser sediments. The study showed that BTA detected and depicted specific features that correlated with gradients in pollution and may be important for sediment reworking and nutrient cycling. As part of the present work, trait information for >500 macrofaunal taxa have been assembled and entered in a comprehensive database. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Premise of the Study: Leaf area is a key trait that links plant form, function, and environment. Measures of leaf area can be biased because leaf area is often estimated from dried or fossilized specimens that have shrunk by an unknown amount. We tested the common assumption that this shrinkage is negligible.
   Methods: We measured shrinkage by comparing dry and fresh leaf area in 3401 leaves of 380 temperate and tropical species and used phylogenetic and trait-based approaches to determine predictors of this shrinkage. We also tested the effects of rehydration and simulated fossilization on shrinkage in four species.
   Key Results: We found that dried leaves shrink in area by an average of 22% and a maximum of 82%. Shrinkage in dried leaves can be predicted by multiple morphological traits with a standard deviation of 7.8%. We also found that mud burial, a proxy for compression fossilization, caused negligible shrinkage, and that rehydration, a potential treatment of dried herbarium specimens, eliminated shrinkage.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the amount of shrinkage is driven by variation in leaf area, leaf thickness, evergreenness, and woodiness and can be reversed by rehydration. The amount of shrinkage may also be a useful trait related to ecologically and physiological differences in drought tolerance and plant life history.

AB 1. Coleoptera species show considerable diversity in life histories and ecological strategies, which makes possible their wide distribution in freshwater habitats, including highly stressed ones such as saline or temporary waterbodies. Explaining how particular combinations of traits allow species to occupy distinctive habitats is a central question in ecology. 2. A total of 212 sites, sampled over a wide range of inland aquatic habitats in the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula, yielded 272 species belonging to 68 genera and 11 families. The affinities of genera for 11 biological and 11 ecological traits, gathered from literature and the authors own expertise, were used to assess the degree of congruence between taxonomic, biological and ecological traits. 3. Taxonomic richness was significantly related to the number of both biological and ecological trait categories, with the richest families also showing the highest functional and ecological diversity. A fuzzy correspondence analysis performed on the abundance-weighed array of biological traits separated genera according to categories of diet, feeding habits, respiration, reproduction and locomotion. A similar analysis of ecological traits revealed that preferences related to longitudinal distribution (headwater to mouth), local habitat and current velocity best discriminated genera. At the family level, there was a distinctive functional grouping of genera based on biological traits. Only Elmidae showed noticeable homogeneity across genera for both biological and ecological traits. 4. Co-inertia analysis demonstrated a significant match between biological and ecological traits (Rv-correlation = 0.35, P < 0.001). Elmidae genera displayed the highest concordance, whereas Hydraenidae demonstrated the lowest. 5. These results indicate that the predominance of habitat filtering processes in headwater streams yields biological trait conservatism (as shown by Elmidae genera), as well as trait convergence for some specific traits (for instance, respiration) among certain Dytiscidae genera and other typical rheophilic taxa, whereas other biotic factors, such as competition among species, appear more prominent in less stressed habitats. Further knowledge of traits, especially regarding physiological capabilities, is needed to better understand water beetle life history strategies.

AB The objective of this study was to test if morphological differences in pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus found in their native range (eastern North America) that are linked to feeding regime, competition with other species, hydrodynamic forces and habitat were also found among stream- and lake- or reservoir-dwelling fish in Iberian systems. The species has been introduced into these systems, expanding its range, and is presumably well adapted to freshwater Iberian Peninsula ecosystems. The results show a consistent pattern for size of lateral fins, with L. gibbosus that inhabit streams in the Iberian Peninsula having longer lateral fins than those inhabiting reservoirs or lakes. Differences in fin placement, body depth and caudal peduncle dimensions do not differentiate populations of L. gibbosus from lentic and lotic water bodies and, therefore, are not consistent with functional expectations. Lepomis gibbosus from lotic and lentic habitats also do not show a consistent pattern of internal morphological differentiation, probably due to the lack of loticlentic differences in prey type. Overall, the univariate and multivariate analyses show that most of the external and internal morphological characters that vary among populations do not differentiate lotic from lentic Iberian populations. The lack of expected differences may be a consequence of the high seasonal flow variation in Mediterranean streams, and the resultant low- or no-flow conditions during periods of summer drought.

AB The relationship between form and function can have profound effects on evolutionary dynamics and such effects may differ for simple versus complex systems. In particular, functions produced by multiple structural configurations (many-to-one mapping, MTOM) may dampen constituent trade-offs and promote diversification. Unfortunately, we lack information about the genetic architecture of MTOM functional systems. The skulls of teleost fishes contain both simple (lower jaw levers) as well as more complex (jaws modeled as 4-bar linkages) functional systems within the same craniofacial unit. We examined the mapping of form to function and the genetic basis of these systems by identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) in hybrids of two Lake Malawi cichlid species. Hybrid individuals exhibited novelty (transgressive segregation) in morphological components and function of the simple and complex jaw systems. Functional novelty was proportional to the prevalence of extreme morphologies in the simple levers; by contrast, recombination of parental morphologies produced transgression in the MTOM 4-bar linkage. We found multiple loci of moderate effect and epistasis controlling jaw phenotypes in both the simple and complex systems, with less phenotypic variance explained by QTL for the 4-bar. Genetic linkage between components of the simple and complex systems partly explains phenotypic correlations and may constrain functional evolution.

AB Aim In times of biodiversity crisis, it is extremely important to understand diversity gradients. In particular, the study of the diversity of ecological functions is a key issue for the management of ecosystem integrity. Here we identify areas of low functional diversity of the native fish fauna in European drainage basins and we determine the relative importance of three underlying mechanisms: environmental filtering, geographic isolation and climatic history. Location The European continent. Methods Based on 14 morphological traits that are closely related to fish function (habitat and dietary niches), three independent functional diversity indices [functional richness (FR), functional evenness (FE), functional divergence (FD)] were calculated for 128 European drainage basins with a total of 230 fish species. The indices were standardized for species richness using null models. The patterns of the standardized indices are described and three potentially underlying mechanisms are tested using variance partitioning and multi-linear regression models. Results FR and FD were highest in eastern European drainage basins and in Great Britain and lowest in the Mediterranean. FE patterns were less pronounced. All observed patterns were mainly governed by geographic isolation and present environmental conditions. Within the environmental conditions, average annual temperature and precipitation were good predictors for functional diversity. The role of habitat diversity and size was negligible. Main conclusions Geographic isolation coupled with harsh environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures and low precipitation, as in Mediterranean regions, can lead to low FR and FD. This can be explained by extinction that could not be compensated by re-colonization and high speciation. Due to their high functional redundancy, communities in these areas might better withstand further species extinctions on a small scale. Over the short term, however, their often extremely low FR suggests a less flexible functioning that can hinder their ability to withstand today's rapid environmental and anthropogenic threats.

AB To evaluate the first stages of adaptation and differentiation following colonization into a vacant and ecologically divergent habitat, 100 melanistic and low-plated adult threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) exhibiting gigantism in body size and robust spines were transferred in 1993 from a large dystrophic lake (Mayer Lake, Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada) with a diverse vertebrate predator regime, into an adjacent fishless eutrophic pond with macroinvertebrate piscivores. Eight generations were examined as a test of multiple functional hypotheses on the morphological traits that differentiate lake and pond stickleback throughout their distribution. Measurements of 20 defence and trophic traits were made on 275 wild-caught fish collected from the source and transplant populations over multiple years. There have been significant reductions (males: females) in plate count (8%: 0.5%), lateral plate?2 frequency (46%: 17%), lateral plate?3 height (17%: 18%), pelvic spine length (12%: 6%), dorsal spine length (21%: 16%), gill raker number (5%: 1%), and gill raker length (37%: 43%), and an increase in gill raker spacing (+5%: 0%), jaw length (+5%: +4%), and eye diameter (+8%: +7%). These changes within eight generations represent one-third of the morphological differences observed between naturally established large lake and pond populations in these archipelago and are all in the direction predicted from the change in habitat. Field samples indicate strong selection in the colonists although lab-reared individuals implicate an additional role of plasticity for dorsal spine and gill raker lengths, which may contribute to the rapid adaptation into novel and highly divergent selective landscapes.

AB The identification of the main factors driving phytoplankton community structure is essential to understand and adequately manage freshwater ecosystems. We hypothesize that differences in morphological traits reflect phytoplankton functional properties that will be selected under particular environmental conditions, namely their habitat template. We apply a morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) approach to classify phytoplankton organisms and define each group template. We use machine learning techniques to classify a large number of phytoplankton communities and environmental variables from different climate zones and continents. Random forest analysis explained well the distribution of most groups' biovolume and the selected variables reflected ecological preferences according to morphology. By means of a classification tree it was also possible to identify thresholds of the environmental variables promoting groups dominance in different lakes. For example group III (filaments with aerotopes and high surface/volume including potentially toxic species) was dominant when light attenuation coefficient was > 3.9 m(-1) and total nitrogen was > 2,800 mu g l(-1). We demonstrate that morphology captures ecological preferences of phytoplankton groups and provides empirical values to describe their habitat template.

AB Disturbance-mediated species loss has prompted research considering how ecosystem functions are changed when biota is impaired. However, there is still limited empirical evidence from natural environments evaluating the direct and indirect (i.e. via biota) effects of disturbance on ecosystem functioning. Oxygen deficiency is a widespread threat to coastal and estuarine communities. While the negative impacts of hypoxia on benthic communities are well known, few studies have assessed in situ how benthic communities subjected to different degrees of hypoxic stress alter their contribution to ecosystem functioning. We studied changes in sediment ecosystem function (i.e. oxygen and nutrient fluxes across the sediment water-interface) by artificially inducing hypoxia of different durations (0, 3, 7 and 48 days) in a subtidal sandy habitat. Benthic chamber incubations were used for measuring responses in sediment oxygen and nutrient fluxes. Changes in benthic species richness, structure and traits were quantified, while stress-induced behavioral changes were documented by observing bivalve reburial rates. The initial change in faunal behavior was followed by non-linear degradation in benthic parameters (abundance, biomass, bioturbation potential), gradually impairing the structural and functional composition of the benthic community. In terms of ecosystem function, the increasing duration of hypoxia altered sediment oxygen consumption and enhanced sediment effluxes of NH4+ and dissolved Si. Although effluxes of PO43- were not altered significantly, changes were observed in sediment PO43- sorption capability. The duration of hypoxia (i.e. number of days of stress) explained a minor part of the changes in ecosystem function. Instead, the benthic community and disturbancedriven changes within the benthos explained a larger proportion of the variability in sediment oxygen-and nutrient fluxes. Our results emphasize that the level of stress to the benthic habitat matters, and that the link between biodiversity and ecosystem function is likely to be affected by a range of factors in complex, natural environments.

AB Vegetative diversity metrics are often used to characterize wetland restoration success. Here we examine whether other important vegetative traits (nutrient standing stocks and tissue nutrient concentrations) can improve our understanding of the structure of restored and reference wetlands and aid in the assessment of functional equivalency. We focus on wetlands of the Upper Klamath Basin (UKB), Oregon because this basin supports a mosaic of remnant, restored, and degraded wetlands dominated by a limited number of common emergent plant species. We summarize nutrient standing stocks using 11 growth limiting micro- and macronutrients present in aboveground tissues of three emergent plant species. We show that interspecific variation in nutrient standing stocks and tissue nutrient concentrations was high and greater than inter-site differences. Interspecific variation for nitrogen standing stocks was 3X larger than inter-site variation. Although less common, inter-site differences in nutrient standing stocks and tissue nutrient concentrations were detected and tissue phosphorus concentrations in a recently restored wetland were nearly twice those of a reference wetland; corresponding levels of aboveground biomass in this wetland were not detected. Our detection of elevated phosphorus in the vegetation of a recently restored wetland is consistent with predictions from both experimental and observational work in UKB and demonstrates that nutrient standing stocks provide important clues about the fate and retention of nutrients in restoration wetlands. Importantly, we show that these vegetative attributes also provide a measure of functional equivalency that is rarely used in the assessment of restoration success.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key component of the carbon cycle and has significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems and potable water treatment. Upward trends in river and lacaustrine DOC concentrations have been observed and a number of key drivers have been proposed. Here, we present DOC concentration data from plot scale pore waters at one site and surface water from artificial drains sampled within a national survey which demonstrate a significant correlation between peatland vegetation type and DOC concentration. Calluna dominance was associated with the highest DOC concentration, Molinia and Sphagnum dominance with lower concentrations, and sedge dominance with intermediate concentrations. Water sampled from drains dominated by Calluna had greater DOC concentrations than water sampled from pore waters in plots dominated by Calluna. In contrast DOC concentrations from plots dominated by sedges were greater than those sampled from drains dominated by sedges. We discuss these findings in relation to plant functional traits and their influence on the physical and biotic conditions that regulate DOC concentrations. Given the known effects of management activities and climate change on peatland vegetation composition there is potential to manage plant community composition to ameliorate the observed rising DOC concentration.

AB Despite the long history of vegetation mapping with remote sensing, challenges remain in effectively linking remote sensing observations with plant traits and environmental disturbance across species and functional types. This study proposes a classification of aquatic and wetland vegetation plant functional types (PFTs) using time series remotely sensed data applicable to wetland ecosystems with large annual water level changes like Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake-wetland of China. We first developed the aquatic and wetland PFT classification scheme which included perennial C-4 grasses, perennial C-3 reed, C-3 (sedges and taller forbs), short C-3 forbs, floating aquatic macrophytes, and submerged aquatic macrophytes. Using this scheme, time series normalized difference vegetation index (time series NDVI) images and time series vegetation-water index (time series VWI) images extracted from 32-m spatial resolution Beijing-1 microsatellite data were applied to perform two PFT classifications with a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. We found that the time series NDVI-based SVM classification method mapped aquatic and wetland PFT distribution with an overall accuracy of 81.3%. However, when the information on water level fluctuation was combined with time series NDVI into a new time series index (referred to as time series VWI), the overall accuracy increased to 90.4%. Results suggest that time series VWI has a stronger capability in distinguishing wetland PFTs with different submersion times and flood tolerances than time series NDVI, and thus may be considered as a key input dataset for future PFt classifications in seasonally dynamic wetlands.

AB Riparian ecotones in the fynbos biome of South Africa are heavily invaded by woody invasive alien species, which are known to reduce water supply to downstream environments. To explore whether variation in species-specific functional traits pertaining to drought-tolerance exist, we investigated wood anatomical traits of key native riparian species and the invasive Acacia mearnsii across different water availability proxies. Wood density, vessel resistance against implosion, vessel lumen diameter and vessel wall thickness were measured. Wood density varied significantly between species, with A. mearnsii having denser wood at sites in rivers with high discharge. As higher wood density is indicative of increased drought tolerance and typical of drier sites, this counter-intuitive finding suggests that increased wood density was more closely related to midday water stress, than streamflow quantity per se. Wood density was positively correlated with vessel resistance against implosion. Higher wood density may also be evidence that A. mearnsii is more resistant against drought-induced cavitation than the studied native species. The observed plastic response of A. mearnsii anatomical traits to variable water availability indicates the ability of this species to persist under various environmental conditions. A possible non-causal relationship between wood anatomy and drought tolerance in these riparian systems is discussed.

AB Recent documentation of a few compelling examples of sympatric speciation led to a proliferation of theoretical models. Unfortunately, plausible examples from nature have rarely been used to test model predictions, such as the initial presence of strong disruptive selection. Here I estimated the form and strength of selection in two classic examples of sympatric speciation: radiations of Cameroon cichlids restricted to Lakes Barombi Mbo and Ejagham. I measured five functional traits and relative growth rates in over 500 individuals within incipient species complexes from each lake. Disruptive selection was prevalent in both groups on single and multivariate trait axes but weak relative to stabilizing selection on other traits and most published estimates of disruptive selection. Furthermore, despite genetic structure, assortative mating, and bimodal species-diagnostic coloration, trait distributions were unimodal in both species complexes, indicating the earliest stages of speciation. Long waiting times or incomplete sympatric speciation may result when disruptive selection is initially weak. Alternatively, I present evidence of additional constraints in both species complexes, including weak linkage between coloration and morphology, reduced morphological variance aligned with nonlinear selection surfaces, and minimal ecological divergence. While other species within these radiations show complete phenotypic separation, morphological and ecological divergence in these species complexes may be slow or incomplete outside optimal parameter ranges, in contrast to rapid divergence of their sexual coloration.

AB Ecological risk assessment (ERA) has followed a taxonomy-based approach, making the assumption that related species will show similar sensitivity to toxicants, and using safety factors or species sensitivity distributions to extrapolate from tested to untested species. In ecology it has become apparent that taxonomic approaches may have limitations for the description and understanding of species assemblages in nature. Therefore it has been proposed that the inclusion of species traits in ERA could provide a useful and alternative description of the systems under investigation. At the same time, there is a growing recognition that the use of mechanistic approaches in ERA, including conceptual and quantitative models, may improve predictive and extrapolative power. Purposefully linking traits with mechanistic effect models could add value to taxonomy-based ERA by improving our understanding of how structural and functional system facets may facilitate inter-species extrapolation. Here, we explore whether and in what ways traits can be linked purposefully to mechanistic effect models to predict intrinsic sensitivity using available data on the acute sensitivity and toxicokinetics of a range of freshwater arthropods exposed to chlorpyrifos. The results of a quantitative linking of seven different endpoints and twelve traits demonstrate that while quantitative links between traits and/or trait combinations and process based (toxicokinetic) model parameters can be established, the use of simple traits to predict classical sensitivity endpoints yields little insight. Remarkably, neither of the standard sensitivity values, i.e. the LC50 or EC50, showed a strong correlation with traits. Future research in this area should include a quantitative linking of toxicodynamic parameter estimations and physiological traits, and requires further consideration of how mechanistic trait-process/parameter links can be used for prediction of intrinsic sensitivity across species for different substances in ERA.

AB Identifying the environmental gradients that control the functional structure of biological assemblages in reference conditions is fundamental to help river management and predict the consequences of anthropogenic stressors. Fish metrics (density of ecological guilds, and species richness) from 117 least disturbed stream reaches in several western Iberia river basins were modelled with generalized linear models in order to investigate the importance of regional-and local-scale abiotic gradients to variation in functional structure of fish assemblages. Functional patterns were primarily associated with regional features, such as catchment elevation and slope, rainfall, and drainage area. Spatial variations of fish guilds were thus associated with broad geographic gradients, showing (1) pronounced latitudinal patterns, affected mainly by climatic factors and topography, or (2) at the basin level, strong upstream-downstream patterns related to stream position in the longitudinal gradient. Maximum native species richness was observed in midsize streams in accordance with the river continuum concept. The findings of our study emphasized the need to use a multi-scale approach in order to fully assess the factors that govern the functional organization of biotic assemblages in 'natural' streams, as well as to improve biomonitoring and restoration of fluvial ecosystems.

AB Premise of the study: The filamentous chlorophyte Cladophora produces abundant nearshore populations in marine and freshwaters worldwide, often dominating periphyton communities and producing nuisance growths under eutrophic conditions. High surface area and environmental persistence foster such high functional and taxonomic diversity of epiphytic microfauna and microalgae that Cladophora has been labeled an ecological engineer. We tested the hypotheses that (1) Cladophora supports a structurally and functionally diverse epiphytic prokaryotic microbiota that influences materials cycling and (2) mutualistic host-microbe interactions occur. Because previous molecular sequencing-based analyses of the microbiota of C. glomerata found as western Lake Michigan beach drift had identified pathogenic associates such as Escherichia coli, we also asked if actively growing lentic C. glomerata harbors known pathogens.
   Methods: We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing to examine the microbiota of C. glomerata of Lake Mendota, Dane, Wisconsin, United States, during the growing season of 2011, at the genus-or species-level to infer functional phenotypes. We used correlative scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy to describe major prokaryotic morphotypes.
   Key results: We found microscopic evidence for diverse bacterial morphotypes, and molecular evidence for ca. 100 distinct sequence types classifiable to genus at the 80% confidence level or species at the 96-97% level within nine bacterial phyla, but not E. coli or related human pathogens.
   Conclusions: We inferred that bacterial epiphytes of lentic C. glomerata have diverse functions in materials cycling, with traits that indicate the occurrence of mutualistic interactions with the algal host.

AB Much is known about how environmental stress mediates the strength of facilitation, but less is known about how different plant traits affect facilitation. We examined interactions between the shrub Tamarix chinensis and two congeneric forbs (Suaeda salsa and S. glauca) on the Chinese coast. Although S. salsa and S. glauca are both annuals, morphologically similar, and have synchronous phenologies, they have contrasting adaptive strategies. S. glauca is salt intolerant but competitively superior, and S. salsa is salt tolerant but competitively inferior. Field surveys showed that S. glauca was associated with T. chinensis canopies while S. salsa was more abundant in open areas. A T. chinensis removal experiment showed that S. glauca cover was lower and soil salinity higher after two years in removal than in control plots. Transplant experiments showed that S. salsa performance under T. chinensis canopies was reduced by competition from S. glauca and T. chinensis, while in open areas S. glauca was not affected by S. salsa competition. Thus, contrasting competitive abilities and stress tolerances of S. glauca and S. salsa underlie their facilitative and competitive interactions with T. chinensis, suggesting that plant strategies are critical to the outcome of species interactions.

AB Macroinvertebrate species composition data are often expressed as proportional abundances when assessing water-quality conditions or responses to disturbance. Proportional abundances represent the probability of belonging to one of many mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups (taxa). Proportional abundances have some unique properties that must be considered when analyzing these data: 1) the probabilities of group membership must sum to 1 and 2) a change in any 1 group affects all other groups. We used multinomial regressions to analyze changes in proportional abundances along gradients of urbanization in 9 metropolitan areas across the USA. Multinomial regression can be used to address multiple nonlinear responses simultaneously, whereas simple linear regressions must be used to analyze linear or polynomial responses of each group independently. We established that: 1) abundance ratios of tolerant and moderately tolerant groups responded consistently (3-5% increase in the ratios for every 1% increase in developed land cover in the watershed) across the urban gradient, 2) functional groups did not change significantly, and 3) ratios based on assemblage metrics were better indicators of environmental disturbance than ratios based on individual taxa. Multinomial regression, with its flexible model form, can capture patterns of species succession along a resource or stressor gradient. Our results also demonstrate that users of multinomial regression may encounter numerical problems with rare taxa, especially when these taxa have a complete separation along the gradient. Consequently, multinomial regressions are more suitable for analyzing aggregations of taxa or taxon traits.

AB Detritus processing is driven by a complex interplay between macroinvertebrate and microbial activities. Bioturbation/feeding activities of invertebrates in sediments are known to influence decomposition rates. However, direct effects of invertebrates on bacterial communities and detritus processing remain ill-defined, mainly because identifying interactions between invertebrates and sediments is methodologically challenging. We incubated 5 macroinvertebrate species with various bioturbation/feeding traits separately in sediment-filled microcosms inoculated with bacterial communities for 5 d. At the end of the experiment, we assessed: 1) detritus processing (mass loss on ignition [LOI] and dissolved organic C accumulation in the overlying water [absorbance at 280 nm]), 2) bacterial community structure (intergenic spacer analysis [RISA]) and bacterial activity (electron transport system activity [ETSA]), and 3) development of redox potential (Eh) over time (with permanently installed microelectrodes). Invertebrates enhanced bacterial activity and detritus processing, and the magnitude depended on bioturbation/feeding traits. Bacterial community structure differed significantly between microcosms with burrowing invertebrates and microcosms with sediment-dwelling invertebrates. Eh profiles were similar among microcosms with invertebrates with similar bioturbation/feeding traits, but differed among microcosms with invertebrates with dissimilar bioturbation/feeding traits. Our results suggest that bioturbation by aquatic invertebrates mediates detritus processing, Eh dynamics, and structure of the microbial community. These findings highlight the significance of bioturbation and show the utility of spatiotemporal Eh dynamics as footprints reflecting functioning of benthic detrital food webs.

AB Aim Ecologists seeking to describe patterns at ever larger scales require compilations of data on the global abundance and distribution of species. Comparable compilations of biological data are needed to elucidate the mechanisms behind these patterns, but have received far less attention. We assess the availability of biological data across an entire assemblage: the well-documented demersal marine fauna of the United Kingdom. We also test whether data availability for a species depends on its taxonomic group, maximum body size, the number of times it has been recorded in a global biogeographic database, or its commercial and conservation importance. Location Seas of the United Kingdom. Methods We defined a demersal marine fauna of 973 species from 15 phyla and 40 classes using five extensive surveys around the British Isles. We then quantified the availability of data on eight key biological traits (termed biological knowledge) for each species from online databases. Relationships between biological knowledge and our predictors were tested with generalized linear models. Results Full data on eight fundamental biological traits exist for only 9% (n= 88) of the UK demersal marine fauna, and 20% of species completely lack data. Clear trends in our knowledge exist: fish (median biological knowledge score = six traits) are much better known than invertebrates (one trait). Biological knowledge increases with biogeographic knowledge and (to a lesser extent) with body size, and is greater in species that are commercially exploited or of conservation concern. Main conclusions Our analysis reveals deep ignorance of the basic biology of a well-studied fauna, highlighting the need for far greater efforts to compile biological trait data. Clear biases in our knowledge, relating to how well sampled or important species are suggests that caution is required in extrapolating small subsets of biologically well-known species to ecosystem-level studies.

AB The river valleys in Southwest China are characterized by a dry-hot climate and relatively rich soils, and host valley-type savannas that are dominated by deciduous species. However, little is known about the ecological adaptations of Chinese savanna plants to the local environments. We hypothesize that Chinese savanna species mainly possess a drought-avoiding strategy by having a deciduous leaf habit and have productive leaf traits. To test this hypothesis, we measured 26 anatomical, morphological, physiological, and chemical traits for 33 woody species from a valley savanna in Southwest China and compared them with the literature data of other dry and wet tropical tree species and a global dataset. We found that Chinese savanna species showed drought avoidance adaptations and exhibited productive leaf traits, such as thin and dense leaves with high ratio of palisade to spongy mesophyll, leaf nutrient concentrations and photosynthetic capacity. Correlations of photosynthetic capacity with N, P, and stomatal conductance across Chinese savanna species were consistent with global patterns reported for seed plants. However, the Chinese savanna species had consistently greater carbon gain at a given specific leaf area, N, P, and stomatal conductance, suggesting higher nutrient- and intrinsic water use efficiencies. These results suggest that paradoxically, Chinese savanna species are adapted to the stressful dry-hot valley habitat by having productive leaves.

AB 1. Quantifying the relative importance of environmental filtering versus regional spatial structuring has become an intensively studied area in the context of metacommunity ecology. However, most studies have evaluated the role of environmental and spatial processes using taxonomic data sets of single snapshot surveys. 2. Here, we examined temporal changes in patterns and possible processes behind the functional metacommunity organization of stream fishes in a human-modified landscape. Specifically, we (i) studied general changes in the functional composition of fish assemblages among 40 wadeable stream sites during a 3-year study period in the catchment area of Lake Balaton, Hungary, (ii) quantified the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors as determinants of metacommunity structure and (iii) examined temporal variability in the relative role of spatial and environmental processes for this metacommunity. 3. Partial triadic analysis showed that assemblages could be effectively ordered along a functional gradient from invertebrate consuming species dominated by the opportunistic life-history strategy, to assemblages with a diverse array of functional attributes. The analysis also revealed that functional fish assemblage structure was moderately stable among the sites between the sampling periods. 4. Despite moderate stability, variance partitioning using redundancy analyses (RDA) showed considerable temporal variability in the contribution of environmental and spatial factors to this pattern. The analyses also showed that environmental variables were, in general, more important than spatial ones in determining metacommunity structure. Of these, natural environmental variables (e.g. altitude, velocity) proved to be more influential than human-related effects (e.g. pond area, % inhabited area above the site, nutrient enrichment), even in this landscape with relatively low variation in altitude and stream size. 5. Pond area was, however, the most important human stressor variable that was positively associated with the abundance of non-native species with diverse functional attributes. The temporal variability in the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors was probably shaped by the release of non-native fish from fish ponds to the stream system during flood events. 6. To conclude, both spatial processes and environmental control shape the functional metacommunity organization of stream fish assemblages in human-modified landscapes, but their importance can vary in time. We argue, therefore, that metacommunity studies should better consider temporal variability in the ecological mechanisms (e.g. dispersal limitation, species sorting) that determine the dynamics of landscape-level community organization.

AB 1. To assess the biological status and response of aquatic resources to management actions, managers and decision-makers require accurate and precise metrics. This is especially true for some parts of the Florida Everglades where multiple stressors (e.g. hydrologic alterations and eutrophication) have resulted in a highly degraded and fragmented ecosystem. Biological assessments are required that directly allow for the evaluation of historical and current status and responses to implantation of large-scale restoration projects. 2. Utilising periphyton composition and water-quality data obtained from long-term (15 years) monitoring programmes, we developed calibrated and verified periphyton-based numerical models (transfer functions) that could be used to simultaneously assess multiple stressors affecting the Everglades peatland (e.g. salinity, nitrogen and phosphorus). Periphyton is an ideal indicator because responses to stressors are rapid and predictable and possess valued ecological attributes. 3. Weighted averaging partial least squares regression was used to develop models to infer water-quality concentrations from 456 samples comprising 319 periphyton taxa. Measured versus periphyton-inferred concentrations were strongly related for log-transformed salinity ( = 0.81; RMSEP 0.15 mg L-1) and log-transformed total phosphorus (TP; = 0.70; RMSEP 0.18 mg L-1), but weakly related for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) ( = 0.46; RMSEP 0.12 mg L-1). Validation results using an independent 455 sample data set were similar (log(salinity) r2 = 0.78, log(TP) r2 = 0.65 and log(TKN) r2 = 0.38). 4. Water Conservation Area 1 (WCA-1), a large ombrotrophic subtropical peatland impacted by multiple water-quality stressors that has undergone major changes in water management, was used as a case study. The models were applied to a long-term periphyton data set to reconstruct water-quality trends in relation to restoration efforts to reduce nutrient loading to the Everglades. The combination of biologically inferred TP and salinity was used to identify the ecological status of periphyton assemblages. Periphyton assemblages were ecologically imbalanced with respect to salinity and TP. Salinity imbalance varied spatially and temporally, whereas TP was spatially restricted. Imbalances caused by water management were owing to salinity more so than to TP. 5. The transfer functions developed for the Everglades are trait-based quantitative numerical methods and are ideal because the abundances of species are modelled numerically in relation to a stressor. The resulting inferred value is a numerical representation of the stressors effect on biological condition that can be compared against the management of the stressor independent of other factors. The benefits are that biological lags or hysteresis events can easily be identified and environmental conditions can be estimated when measurements are lacking. Reporting biological assessments in terms of well-defined water-quality metrics (e.g. numeric criterion) increased the communicative ability of the assessment. The use of multiple metrics to assess ecological imbalance increased the ability to identify probable causes.

AB The occasion of the Xenarthra Symposium during the ICVM 9 meeting allowed us to reflect on the considerable advances in the knowledge of sloths made by the "X-community" over the past two decades, particularly in such aspects as locomotion, mastication, diet, dental terminology, intraspecific variation, sexual dimorphism, and phylogenetic relationships. These advancements have largely been made possible by the application of cladistic methodology (including DNA analyses) and the discovery of peculiar forms such as Diabolotherium, Thalassocnus, and Pseudoglyptodon in traditionally neglected areas such as the Chilean Andes and the Peruvian Pacific desert coast. Modern tree sloths exhibit an upside-down posture and suspensory locomotion, but the habits of fossil sloths are considerably more diverse and include locomotory modes such as inferred bipedality, quadrupedality, arboreality or semiarboreality, climbing, and an aquatic or semi-aquatic lifestyle in saltwater. Modern tree sloths are generalist browsers, but fossil sloths had browsing, grazing, or mixed feeding dietary habits. Discovery of two important sloth faunas in Brazil (Jacobina) and southern North America (Daytona Beach and Rancho La Brea) have permitted evaluation of the ontogenetic variation in Eremotherium laurillardi and the existence of possible sexual dimorphism in this sloth and in Paramylodon harlani. A new dental terminology applicable to a majority of clades has been developed, facilitating comparisons among taxa. An analysis wherein functional traits were plotted onto a phylogeny of sloths was used to determine patterns of evolutionary change across the clade. These analyses suggest that megatherioid sloths were primitively semiarboreal or possessed climbing adaptations, a feature retained in some members of the family Megalonychidae. Pedolateral stance in the hindfoot is shown to be convergently acquired in Mylodontidae and Megatheria (Nothrotheriidae + Megatheriidae), this feature serving as a synapomorphy of the latter clade. Digging adaptations can only be securely ascribed to scelidotheriine and mylodontine sloths, and the latter are also the only group of grazing sloths, the remainder being general browsers.

AB The present study aims to detect functional diversity as well as functional redundancy patterns of soft bottom benthic communities in relation to the prevailing environmental factors, across several brackish water areas. We further tested whether differences in spatial scale can account for the possible variability in functional trait distribution, as well as for the local community assembly processes driven by species functional traits. Our main results suggested that environmental variation induces a large amount of variability in functional trait distribution at local and regional scale, a result which underscores the importance of habitat and environmental variation in the functioning of soft sediments in brackish areas. Conversely to functional diversity, functional redundancy remained invariable in both local and regional scales, therefore acting as an insurance against the enhanced environmental variability and maintaining ecosystem processes and services. Our findings led us also to conclude that environmental factors control the distribution of certain functional traits thus acting as environmental filters, in both local and regional scales. On the other hand, dominant species interactions accounted for the reduced levels of functional divergence at the less confined brackish water areas. This finding supported the view that interactions among dominant species can potentially induce negative effects on the functionality of brackish water soft sediments. From all the above, it is reasonable to assume that community shaping and functioning of the examined brackish water areas are governed by both biotic interactions and environmental filters, which are acting simultaneously at varying degrees of influence.

AB Human-induced reductions in species richness might alter the quality of ecosystem services when the remaining species are not able to substitute the functions provided by extirpated species. We examined how human disturbances (nutrient enrichment, land use intensification, instream habitat degradation and the presence of alien species) influence the species richness of stream invertebrates. Stream invertebrates (425 native species) were collected by kick and sweep sampling technique at 274 stream sites covering the entire area of Hungary. We measured the species richness, functional richness (i.e. number of unique functional roles provided by community members) and functional redundancy (i.e. the functional insurance of the community) using information on the feeding habits of each species. To remove the effect of natural variability, we tested the effect of stressors on the residuals of models relating species richness, functional richness and functional redundancy with natural environmental gradients. Our results showed that species richness was negatively influenced by instream habitat degradation and nutrient enrichment. Independent of the way of quantifying functional richness and functional redundancy, we found that functional richness is more sensitive to human impact than functional redundancy of stream invertebrates. The finding that a reduction of species richness is associated with a loss of unique functional roles (functional richness) is important for conservation issues, because the number of unique functional roles is usually regarded as driver of ecosystem functioning.

AB Within transitional/estuarine environments 'ecosystem functioning' has been mostly investigated with "traditional" taxonomic analysis, based on the taxonomic composition of benthic invertebrate communities. However, 'ecosystem functioning' depends also greatly on the functional characteristics (biological traits) of organisms.
   It was a priori suggested that the biological traits of the subticlal benthic invertebrate communities within an estuarine environment would respond to the high variability of environmental pressures (natural and human induced) within this type of ecosystem.
   For this study, traditional taxonomic analysis (species richness, species density and Shannon-Wiener diversity) as well as biological trait analysis were used together for the first time to investigate the response of the subtidal benthic invertebrate communities to the environmental pressures within the Mondego estuary (Portugal).
   Biological trait analysis, in addition to traditional taxonomic analysis provided a more comprehensive understanding of the functioning within this type of ecosystem. Some of the most important outcomes are: (i) the trait "salinity preference" was the most important trait that distributed the species along the estuary, (ii) the central part of the estuary appeared to be under higher environmental stress levels than the other areas, as suggested by a dominance of some "opportunistic" traits (e.g. small short-lived species), (iii) the ratio between functional diversity (FD) and Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') indicated lower functional redundancy at the upper reaches of the estuary. Our results, suggest that the ratio (FD/H') might be a helpful tool to visualize this functional attribute and could potentially be applied to different communities from distinct environments. Using the traditional taxonomic analysis alone, this last functional aspect would not be detectable. Therefore, the inclusion of biological traits analysis is recommendable for estuarine ecological studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Global environmental change necessitates a new approach to lotic bioassessment. Although biotic indices are widely accepted by regulatory authorities they are labor intensive to develop and biogeographically restricted in application. While trait-based assessment circumvents these problems, difficulties associated with non-discrete responses to stressors, less robust metric formulation (e.g. % abundance) and complications of the trait syndrome limit its potential uptake.
   We assumed that trait combinations, within the syndrome, would effectively represent synergistic, antagonistic and null interactions with respect to stress sensitivity. Applying this principle of positive and negative complementarity we constructed indicator scores for macroinvertebrate families for the complex stressor of organic pollution based on potentially relevant traits: respiration, habit, trophic class, flow preference, thermal preference, size and activity/mobility. We compared trait-derived sensitivity scores to empirically-derived scores from three versions of a biotic index: the BMWP, a statistically-based revision of the BMWP (s_BMWP) and the BMWP modified for the Iberian Peninsula (IBMWP).
   Trait-derived sensitivity scores were significantly correlated with empirical sensitivity scores: IBMWP > s_BMWP > BMWP. Despite the overall good correspondence, trait-derived scores tended to be consistently underestimated for Heteroptera, Odonata and Ephemeroptera in comparison with BMWP scores. Conversely sensitivity scores for Hirudinea and Gastropoda tended to be overestimated. While revision of the composite trait algorithm could, in some cases, improve these disparities they also indicate the importance of evolution and phylogeny in determining organism sensitivity to river pollution.
   Despite the potentially contentious issues of trait selection and trait weighting, the concept of trait complementarity is arguably more scientifically justifiable than regarding traits as isolated entities. It may offer the most pragmatic means to elaborate biotic indices where empirical methods are problematic. The subsequent ability to deconstruct sensitivity scores to verify their appropriateness would greatly facilitating moves towards harmonized assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tetrapods possess up to five morphologically distinct vertebral series: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral and caudal. The evolution of axial regionalization has been linked to derived Hox expression patterns during development and the demands of weight-bearing and walking on land. These evolutionary and functional explanations are supported by an absence of similar traits in fishes, living and extinct. Here, I show that, Tarrasius problematicus, a marine ray-finned fish from the Mississippian (Early Carboniferous; 359-318 Ma) of Scotland, is the first non-tetrapod known to possess tetrapod-like axial regionalization. Tarrasius exhibits five vertebral regions, including a seven-vertebrae 'cervical' series and a reinforced 'sacrum' over the pelvic area. Most vertebrae possess processes for intervertebral contact similar to tetrapod zygapophyses. The fully aquatic Tarrasius evolved these morphologies alongside other traits convergent with early tetrapods, including a naked trunk, and a single median continuous fin. Regional modifications in Tarrasius probably facilitated pelagic swimming, rather than a terrestrial lifestyle or walking gait, presenting an alternative scenario for the evolution of such traits in tetrapods. Axial regionalization in Tarrasius could indicate tetrapod-like Hox expression patterns, possibly representing the primitive state for jawed vertebrates. Alternately, it could signal a weaker relationship, or even a complete disconnect, between Hox expression domains and vertebrate axial plans.

AB Background: Estuaries are highly productive ecosystems that can export organic matter to coastal seas (the 'outwelling hypothesis'). However the role of this food resource subsidy on coastal ecosystem functioning has not been examined.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the influence of estuarine primary production as a resource subsidy and the influence of estuaries on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in coastal mollusk-dominated sediment communities. Stable isotope values (delta C-13, delta N-15) demonstrated that estuarine primary production was exported to the adjacent coast and contributed to secondary production up to 4 km from the estuary mouth. Further, isotope signatures of suspension feeding bivalves on the adjacent coast (Dosinia subrosea) closely mirrored the isotope values of the dominant bivalves inside the estuaries (Austrovenus stutchburyi), indicating utilization of similar organic matter sources. However, the food subsidies varied between estuaries; with estuarine suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) dominant at Tairua estuary, while seagrass and fringing vegetation detritus was proportionately more important at Whangapoua estuary, with lesser contributions of estuarine SPOM. Distance from the estuary mouth and the size and density of large bivalves (Dosinia spp.) had a significant influence on the composition of biological traits in the coastal macrobenthic communities, signaling the potential influence of these spatial subsidies on ecosystem functioning.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our study demonstrated that the locations where ecosystem services like productivity are generated are not necessarily where the services are utilized. Further, we identified indirect positive effects of the nutrient subsidies on biodiversity (the estuarine subsidies influenced the bivalves, which in turn affected the diversity and functional trait composition of the coastal sediment macrofaunal communities). These findings highlight the importance of integrative ecosystem-based management that maintains the connectivity of estuarine and coastal ecosystems.

AB Little is known about the diversity and ecology of earthworms in flocdplains, as well as their response to natural and anthropic perturbations (e.g. floods, river channelisation, floodplain restoration). We characterised the patterns of earthworm communities and species traits in the different habitats of a lowland restored floodplain in Switzerland. In addition to classical species-based metrics, such as species richness and Shannon diversity, species traits were used to calculate the community weighted means (CWMs) of traits and functional dispersion (FDis). We hypothesised that trait-based metrics would reveal clearer patterns than classical approaches. The distribution of earthworm traits varied among habitats in relation to changes in flooding frequency: poorly developed gravel bar soils most exposed to flooding were characterised by high abundance of small epigeic species and low abundance of large anecic species. Differences in anecic and endogeic earthworm community structure matched flood frequency. In agreement with our hypothesis, CWMs were more strongly correlated to environmental variables than species composition, diversity, or functional diversity. Based on these results, the ratio of the relative abundances of epigeic and anecic species, and the differences in species composition within anecic and endogeic ecological types of earthworms were identified as indicators of soil development in floodplains.

AB Macroinvertebrate species traits, such as physiological sensitivity, have successfully been introduced in trait-based bioassessment approaches and are important predictors of species sensitivity in the field. The authors ranked macroinvertebrate species according to their physiological sensitivity to heavy metals using toxicity data from acute laboratory assays. Rankings for each of the heavy metals, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Hg, were standardized based on all available species data. Rankings for different heavy metals on the species level showed no significant difference between compounds and were reasonably well correlated pairwise (0.50?<?r?<?0.73). Thus, an aggregated heavy metal ranking was developed, which assigns a single physiological sensitivity value (Smetal) to macroinvertebrate taxa. Considering the high variation, especially for higher taxonomic levels, that is, in the order level, it is recommended to use S values of the genus or species level for meaningful analyses. In terms of taxonomic ranking, crustaceans were overall the most sensitive taxonomic group, whereas insects were generally the most tolerant group. Species in the order of Cladocera were three orders of magnitude more sensitive than insects of the order of Trichoptera. By contrast, mollusks covered a wide range of sensitivities, with bivalves being on average one order of magnitude more sensitive than gastropods. The authors concluded that physiological sensitivity represents a promising trait for trait-based risk assessment that together with other demographic and recolonization traits may help to identify the effects of heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Ecomorphological changes as a result of natural perturbations in estuarine fish communities were investigated in two South African estuaries (Swartvlei and East Kleinemonde), both before and after the loss of aquatic macrophyte beds in these systems. The fish communities were analysed using an ecomorphological diversity index (EMI) and the results compared to a traditional index, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. The EMI revealed that the major changes in fish community composition recorded in both estuaries were associated with quantitative variations at the species level. Both estuaries essentially lost their macrophyte beds and ended up with the same type of bottom habitat (bare sediment). In both cases the fish morphological variability decreased immediately after aquatic macrophyte loss and then increased to end above the initial value. The ecomorphological analysis appeared to be sensitive to major ecological disturbances that occurred during the study period and this was confirmed by the morphospace configuration. The results indicate that the ecomorphology of the fish community responds to habitat changes and that this change corresponds to alterations in the representation of the different feeding types. These findings therefore contribute to the measurement of morphological changes in estuarine fish assemblages as a result of habitat changes within the ecosystem and we propose that ecomorphological analyses add another dimension to the information provided by existing diversity indices in studying changing fish communities.

AB We studied the effects of re-oligotrophication and climate warming on plankton richness and community stability over a period of 30 years in the deep mesotrophic Lake Zurich (Switzerland). We assembled monthly time-series of phytoplankton and zooplankton taxonomic richness, phytoplankton functional groups (species with similar functional traits) and physico-chemical environmental descriptors (temperature, conductivity, pH, P-PO43-, N-NO3-, light absorption). We used multiple linear regression to test: 1) the effect of environmental variability over time and depth on the accrual of plankton richness; and 2) the relative effect of richness and environmental variability on the stability of plankton. Environmental change was characterised by increase in temperature, decrease in phosphorus levels, reduced temporal variability of both, and higher heterogeneity of phosphorus over depth (spatial heterogeneity). These conditions occurred concurrently with accrual in plankton taxonomic and functional richness. Increase in temperature and spatial heterogeneity were the best predictors of phytoplankton richness, while phytoplankton richness and spatial heterogeneity had the strongest effects on zooplankton richness. Temporal stability in phytoplankton biovolume was mainly affected by variability in phosphorus and temperature, while zooplankton abundance levels were more strongly linked to fluctuations in nitrogen, temperature and phytoplankton biovolumes. Our analysis highlights that climate warming and re-oligotrophication may favour an increase in spatial (depth) heterogeneity in the water column of deep lakes, enhancing the potential for phytoplankton species co-existence and an increase in plankton richness. Our analysis also suggests that the intensity of fluctuations in key environmental variables can be a better predictor of plankton community stability then average richness.

AB Environmental risk assessments (ERA) support regulatory decisions for the commercial cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops. The ERA for terrestrial agroecosystems is well-developed, whereas guidance for ERA of GM crops in aquatic ecosystems is not as well-defined. The purpose of this document is to demonstrate how comprehensive problem formulation can be used to develop a conceptual model and to identify potential exposure pathways, using Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize as a case study. Within problem formulation, the insecticidal trait, the crop, the receiving environment, and protection goals were characterized, and a conceptual model was developed to identify routes through which aquatic organisms may be exposed to insecticidal proteins in maize tissue. Following a tiered approach for exposure assessment, worst-case exposures were estimated using standardized models, and factors mitigating exposure were described. Based on exposure estimates, shredders were identified as the functional group most likely to be exposed to insecticidal proteins. However, even using worst-case assumptions, the exposure of shredders to Bt maize was low and studies supporting the current risk assessments were deemed adequate. Determining if early tier toxicity studies are necessary to inform the risk assessment for a specific GM crop should be done on a case by case basis, and should be guided by thorough problem formulation and exposure assessment. The processes used to develop the Bt maize case study are intended to serve as a model for performing risk assessments on future traits and crops.

AB Large-bodied zooplankton play important roles in the flow of nutrients and energy along the food chain in freshwater ecosystems. However, the importance of functional traits of zooplankton in trophic flow is not well understood. We used the minimal food-chain model, which includes producers (algae), first-order consumers (grazer zooplankton), and secondary consumers (fish), to reveal which functional traits of phyto- or zooplankton affect one of the most important ecosystem processes for functioning, the trophic transfer efficiency (TTE) across three trophic levels. Numerical simulations indicated that, regardless of the level of nutrient loading and the fish density, the conversion coefficient of grazer zooplankton was one of the most important and general factors for determining TTE. The antipredator defense and maximum grazing rate of zooplankton greatly affected TTE, but the effect depended on the level of nutrient loading and the fish density. For an ecosystem that had high nutrient loading and high fish density and in which the zooplankton density was regulated by the top-down effect, antipredator defense and maximum grazing enhanced TTE. Opposite relationships were observed for other states of the ecosystem. In general, those functional traits of the first-order consumers that affected vertical ecological interaction were important for trophic flow in the ecosystem, whereas the sensitivity of trophic flow to these traits depended largely on whether the zooplankton were regulated by the bottom-up or the top-down effect.

AB (Differences in morphological and physiological leaf characteristics between Tabebuia aurea and T. impetiginosa is related to their typical habitats of occurrence). The genus Tabebuia is representative of the Cerrado biome, occurring in savanna and forest formations. These vegetation types are associated with distinct environmental conditions in terms of water availability, microclimate and soil properties. We compared morphological and physiological traits between Tabebuia aurea (Silva Manso) Benth. & Hook. f. ex S. Moore, which is typical of the savanna vegetation, and T impetiginosa (Mart. ex DC.) Standl, which is commonly found in the gallery forests that occur along streams and rivers. Both were sampled in savanna conditions under full sun. The savanna species had higher values of leaf and petiole thickness, specific leaf mass, maximum CO, assimilation on a leaf area basis, stomatal conductance, transpiration and in leaf concentration of carotenoids. The forest species stood out by higher values of specific leaf area, petiole length and of CO, assimilation on a mass basis, parameters related to shade tolerance and higher growth rates. This functional distinction in a range of leaf traits that was maintained when both were naturally growing under similar environmental conditions, suggests that these are probably the result of differences in the evolutionary history of the two species in response to the contrasting environmental conditions in the typical habitats where they occur.

AB The potential for tree components of coffee agroforestry systems to provide ecosystem services is widely recognized. Management practices are a key factor in the amount and quality of ecosystem services provided. There is relatively abundant information on ecosystem services provision within agroforestry systems, but comparatively scant information regarding how coffee farmers manage their plantations, the factors influencing their farming practices and the extent to which farmers' local knowledge - as opposed to global scientific understanding - underpins management decisions. Policymakers and scientists too frequently design development programs and projects in the coffee sector. On occasion technicians are included in the design process, but farmers and their knowledge are always excluded. This research explores farmers' knowledge regarding how trees affect coffee productivity and ecosystem services in Costa Rica. Farmers' knowledge on the effects of trees on coffee productivity was compared with that of other knowledge sources: coffee processors, technicians and scientists. Farmers were shown to have detailed knowledge regarding ecosystem services that their coffee agroforestry systems provide as well as on the interactions between trees and coffee productivity. When asked on the services that trees provide, farmers classified trees according to water protection, soil formation, or contribution to biodiversity conservation. These classifications were related to tree attributes such as leaf size, biomass production or root abundance. Comparison of coffee productivity knowledge from different knowledge sources revealed considerable complementarity and little contradiction.
   The effects of shade trees on biophysical conditions and their interactions with coffee productivity were well understood by farmers. They recorded and classified shade trees as 'fresh' (suitable for integration with coffee) or 'hot' (unsuitable) based on their leaf texture and size, foliage density, crown shape, and root system attributes. The fresh/hot classification significantly related to positive/negative provision of services. This classification was widely used by farmers, and unknown by coffee technicians.
   Detailed local knowledge included several different topics, such as the role of trees in soil formation and in abundance of pollinators. Farmers were also aware of the influence of these ecosystem services on crop productivity. Generally, management decisions were made to maintain coffee productivity rather than ecosystem services. Based on these results, it is suggested that technical interventions addressing the improvement of coffee plantations are more likely to be successful if they take into account not only the scientific information on agroforestry interactions but also the knowledge possessed by farmers. Lack of comprehension of local coffee knowledge could be expected to reduce the success of development programs and projects aimed at improving productivity or other ecosystem services.

AB The Gambia River of West Africa is a large unobstructed river, characterized by a natural flow regime and lateral connectivity across its floodplain. Construction of a major dam, however, is planned. We compared patterns of fish diversity, habitat use, assemblage structure, and the distribution of trophic position and body morphology in riverine and floodplain habitats in Niokolo Koba National Park, located downstream of the planned dam site. A total of 49 fish species were captured, revealing a lognormal distribution as expected for species-rich assemblages. Fish species exhibited a range of habitat use patterns, from generalist to highly habitat-specific, and appeared to migrate laterally among habitats between seasons. Species richness was homogenous among habitats in the wet season yet appeared to increase with isolation from the main river in the dry season. Fish assemblage structure was best explained by the interaction between habitat type and season, underlining the importance of the natural flow regime and lateral connectivity among floodplain habitats. The abundance of fishes having elongate bodies increased with isolation from the main channel in the wet season only. The distribution of fishes having compressed cross-sectional morphology decreased with isolation from the main channel in the dry season only. These patterns of trait distribution support the conclusion that variation in hydrologic connectivity structures the fish assemblage. Our results suggest that altered flow regimes and loss of floodplain habitats after damming could lead to both decreased taxonomic and functional diversity of the fish assemblage.

AB Theories that link plant strategies and abiotic filters discriminate between three strategies: competitive, ruderal or stress-tolerant species, and suggest that functional diversity is higher at intermediate values along the gradients of productivity and disturbance. The mechanism by which abiotic filters screen plant traits in aquatic plant communities has been poorly tested and has led to contrasting results. The present study aimed to test whether functional diversity and abundance of life-history traits corresponding to morphology, fecundity and longevity of aquatic plants were linked to disturbance and productivity. Fifty-nine shallow lakes that were arranged along a gradient of productivity (estimated through total phosphorus concentration) and drought-disturbance frequency were sampled for aquatic plants. Species traits were documented and functional diversity was calculated (richness, dispersion and evenness) for each lake. Increasing total phosphorus concentration was associated with decreased functional richness and dispersion but not functional evenness. Functional diversity did not differ according to disturbance frequency, regardless of the index that was measured. High productivity favoured floating species with storage organs and vegetative reproduction, especially at low disturbance frequency. For all disturbance frequencies, low productivity favoured small species without storage organs and sexual reproduction. The present study partly supports the theoretical model. At high productivity levels, because phytoplankton is a better competitor for light than aquatic plants, plant traits are screened stringently, and species with traits that allow them to reach the photic zone are selected.

AB Aim It is a central issue in ecology and biogeography to understand what governs community assembly and the maintenance of biodiversity in tropical rain forest ecosystems. A key question is the relative importance of environmental species sorting (niche assembly) and dispersal limitation (dispersal assembly), which we investigate using a large dataset from diverse palm communities. Location Lowland rain forest, western Amazon River Basin, Peru. Methods We inventoried palm communities, registering all palm individuals and recording environmental conditions in 149 transects of 5 m x 500 m. We used ordination, Mantel tests and indicator species analysis (ISA) to assess compositional patterns, species responses to geographical location and environmental factors. Mantel tests were used to assess the relative importance of geographical distance (as a proxy for dispersal limitation) and environmental differences as possible drivers of dissimilarity in palm species composition. We repeated the Mantel tests for subsets of species that differ in traits of likely importance for habitat specialization and dispersal (height and range size). Results We found a strong relationship between compositional dissimilarity and environmental distance and a weaker but also significant relationship between compositional dissimilarity and geographical distance. Consistent with expectations, relationships with environmental and geographical distance were stronger for understorey species than for canopy species. Geographical distance had a higher correlation with compositional dissimilarity for small-ranged species compared with large-ranged species, whereas the opposite was true for environmental distance. The main environmental correlates were inundation and soil nutrient levels. Main conclusions The assembly of palm communities in the western Amazon appears to be driven primarily by species sorting according to hydrology and soil, but with dispersal limitation also playing an important role. The importance of environmental characteristics and geographical distance varies depending on plant height and geographical range size in agreement with functional predictions, increasing our confidence in the inferred assembly mechanisms.

AB Variation in traits across species distribution ranges is often indicative of diversifying evolution that can lead to speciation. Of particular interest is whether traits vary clinally or abruptly because the latter pattern can be indicative of incipient speciation. Understanding of intraspecific variation in chemical traits is still in its infancy because studies of population variation have tended to focus on morphology or neutral genetic markers. To address these issues, the composition of cone volatile odours was examined in ten populations of the South African cycad Encephalartos villosus across its range in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu Natal using headspace sampling and analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Because volatiles play a key role in attracting pollinators to cones of Encephalartos cycads and may thus reflect local adaptation to pollinators, pollinator assemblages were also investigated in the ten populations of E. villosus. Volatile compounds from populations in the north of the distribution range were dominated by unsaturated hydrocarbons, whereas, in the southern populations, nitrogen-containing compound and terpenoids were the major compounds. A shift between southern and northern populations appeared to occur at the Umtamvuna River, where populations had odour profiles with components of both the northern and southern populations. However, one population in the north (Vernon Crookes Nature Reserve) had a quantitatively similar odour profile to the populations in the extreme south of the range. These results reveal strong interpopulation variation in the cone scent of E. villosus, including variation in the relative emission of dominant compounds that may play key functional role in this pollination system. However, pollinator assemblages did not differ across the different populations, which suggest that these patterns were produced by co-evolution or drift, rather than by pollinator shifts.

AB In this study, we investigated how taxonomic and functional diversity of fish communities is influenced by forest cover and mesohabitat types in Neotropical lowland streams. We sampled fish fauna of 126 five-metre-long mesohabitats using an electrofishing unit in forested (n = 3) and deforested (n = 3) streams in the upper Parana River basin, south-eastern Brazil. According to velocity and depth, three mesohabitat types have been considered: riffles (shallow and fast-flowing habitat), pools (deep and slow-flowing habitat) and runs (intermediate depth and velocity). Seven functional traits and 27 trait categories related to ecological, behavioural and life-history aspects of fish were considered. Our results indicate that forest cover and mesohabitat type influence fish communities in different ways. Whereas deforestation affects communities primarily through changes in diversity (functional and taxonomic), mesohabitat types determine changes in the functional composition. The increased diversity in deforested mesohabitats is driven by a decrease in species turnover among habitat patches within streams. This can be attributed to new feeding opportunities and microhabitat availabilities in deforested streams so favours the occurrence of species having a particular set of traits, indicating a strong habitattrait relationship.

AB Glacial retreat creates new habitat which is colonized and developed by plants and animals during the process of primary succession. While there has been much debate about the relative role of deterministic and stochastic processes during terrestrial succession, evidence from freshwater ecosystems remains minimal and a general consensus is lacking. Using a unique 27 similar to years record of community assembly following glacial recession in southeast Alaska, we demonstrate significant change in the trait composition of stream invertebrate communities as catchment glacial cover decreased from similar to 70% to zero. Functional diversity increased significantly as glacier cover decreased and taxonomic richness increased. Null modelling approaches led to a key finding that niche filtering processes were dominant when glacial cover was extensive, reflecting water temperature and dispersal constraints. Thereafter the community shifted towards co-occurrence of stochastic and deterministic assembly processes. A further novel discovery was that intrinsic functional redundancy developed throughout the study, particularly because new colonizers possessed similar traits to taxa already present. Rapid glacial retreat is occurring in Arctic and alpine environments worldwide and the assembly processes observed in this study provide new fundamental insights into how glacially influenced stream ecosystems will respond. The findings support tolerance as a key primary successional mechanism in this system, and have broader value for developing our understanding of how biological communities in river ecosystems assemble or restructure in response to environmental change.

AB As the earth system changes in response to human activities, a critical objective is to predict how biogeochemical process rates (e.g. nitrification, decomposition) and ecosystem function (e.g. net ecosystem productivity) will change under future conditions. A particular challenge is that the microbial communities that drive many of these processes are capable of adapting to environmental change in ways that alter ecosystem functioning. Despite evidence that microbes can adapt to temperature, precipitation regimes, and redox fluctuations, microbial communities are typically not optimally adapted to their local environment. For example, temperature optima for growth and enzyme activity are often greater than in situ temperatures in their environment. Here we discuss fundamental constraints on microbial adaptation and suggest specific environments where microbial adaptation to climate change (or lack thereof) is most likely to alter ecosystem functioning. Our framework is based on two principal assumptions. First, there are fundamental ecological trade-offs in microbial community traits that occur across environmental gradients (in time and space). These trade-offs result in shifting of microbial function (e.g. ability to take up resources at low temperature) in response to adaptation of another trait (e.g. limiting maintenance respiration at high temperature). Second, the mechanism and level of microbial community adaptation to changing environmental parameters is a function of the potential rate of change in community composition relative to the rate of environmental change. Together, this framework provides a basis for developing testable predictions about how the rate and degree of microbial adaptation to climate change will alter biogeochemical processes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems across the planet.

AB Mountain stream monitoring is closely related to the survey of bryophyte species since it is there that these organisms are common and show very specialized ecological niches. This work hypothesizes that a close relationship between bryophyte taxonomic and functional categories and microhabitat conditions exists and proposes to explore this link as a basis for fine-scale monitoring.
   The distribution of bryophytes in mountain fluvial microhabitats of northwest and centre-west Portugal was examined at 165 locations. The response of higher level taxonomic groups and life forms and strategies categories along fine-scale hydromorphologic gradients in mountain streambeds was evaluated through multivariate statistical analysis and models.
   Frequency and abundance patterns suggested that species taxonomic groups and life forms and strategies categories distribution are mostly determined by the same microhabitat variables: water velocity, local light incidence and hydrologic zone in the streambed. Additionally, the distribution trends of each category are presented in graphic models summarizing the habitat segregation of bryophyte traits. The specificity of bryophyte distribution patterns were calibrated in undisturbed mountain watercourse to explore their use in monitoring fine-scale variation of flow and light regimes caused by anthropic influence.

AB Following the Water Framework Directive (WFD) requirements, we designed a new multimetric index (I2M2) for the invertebrate-based ecological assessment of French wadeable streams. This index should be able to identify impaired reaches for 17 anthropogenic pressure categories potentially leading to water quality alteration or habitat degradation. Based on a national database, we defined an iterative procedure to select taxonomy- and trait-based metrics exhibiting the best trade-off between (i) high discrimination efficiency, (ii) low specificity and (iii) high stability in least impaired conditions. The I2M2, defined as the best combination of such metrics, has been composed by: (i) Shannon diversity index, (ii) original ASPT score, (iii) the relative abundance of polyvoltine taxa, (iv) the relative abundance of ovoviviparous taxa and (v) taxonomic richness. The I2M2 was tested against an independent data set. It exhibited good and robust pressure-impact relationship for all the pressure categories, correctly identifying in average 82% of reaches impaired by water quality alterations or habitat degradation. The I2M2 significantly improved the detection of impaired reaches by at least 17% for nitrogen compounds and up to 35% for organic micropollutants and clogging risk, when compared to the normalized French biotic index (IBGN). The I2M2 has been proposed for future use in the national biomonitoring of wadeable reaches in the context of the WFD implementation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biodiversity is a measure of the total difference within a biological system. It is understood to arise at genetic, species and multiple levels of community organisation, hence is multidimensional in nature. Biodiversity indices have proliferated in attempts to capture this complexity but may now have confounded it. Here we attempt a reduction to the minimal set of metrics needed to describe biodiversity (often by default taken to be species richness). 1000 model communities with realistic taxonomic composition were synthesised using databases of marine benthic species. A battery of 19 biodiversity indices were calculated for every community and analysed by PCA to show inter-dependence and sensitivity to variation in taxonomic (a surrogate for genetic), functional (based on ecological roles) and structural (based on species abundance) diversity. We found the three major axes of biodiversity were (a) structural complexity, and (b) two different mixtures of taxonomic and functional diversity: it was well approximated by a three-dimensional space of these variables. A scalar distance from the origin of this space could serve as a single valued summary where needed, for example in economic valuations. The most widely used single biodiversity measure - species richness - missed 88.6% of the diversity, emphasising the importance of additional characters and the need for species databases to record functional traits, presence and abundance in communities, and phylogenetic information.

AB Background: The oriental river prawn, Macrobrachium nipponense, is an economically and nutritionally important species of the Palaemonidae family of decapod crustaceans. To date, the sequencing of its whole genome is unavailable as a nonmodel organism. Transcriptomic information is also scarce for this species. In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to produce the first comprehensive expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset for M. nipponense using high-throughput sequencing technologies.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: Total RNA was isolated from eyestalk, gill, heart, ovary, testis, hepatopancreas, muscle, and embryos at the cleavage, gastrula, nauplius and zoea stages. Equal quantities of RNA from each tissue and stage were pooled to construct a cDNA library. Using 454 pyrosequencing technology, we generated a total of 984,204 high quality reads (338.59Mb) with an average length of 344 bp. Clustering and assembly of these reads produced a non-redundant set of 81,411 unique sequences, comprising 42,551 contigs and 38,860 singletons. All of the unique sequences were involved in the molecular function (30,425), cellular component (44,112) and biological process (67,679) categories by GO analysis. Potential genes and their functions were predicted by KEGG pathway mapping and COG analysis. Based on our sequence analysis and published literature, many putative genes involved in sex determination, including DMRT1, FTZ-F1, FOXL2, FEM1 and other potentially important candidate genes, were identified for the first time in this prawn. Furthermore, 6,689 SSRs and 18,107 high-confidence SNPs were identified in this EST dataset.
   Conclusions: The transcriptome provides an invaluable new data for a functional genomics resource and future biological research in M. nipponense. The molecular markers identified in this study will provide a material basis for future genetic linkage and quantitative trait loci analyses, and will be essential for accelerating aquaculture breeding programs with this species.

AB Mechanistic understanding of consumer-resource dynamics is critical to predicting the effects of global change on ecosystem structure, function and services. Such understanding is severely limited by mechanistic models inability to reproduce the dynamics of multiple populations interacting in the field. We surpass this limitation here by extending general consumer-resource network theory to the complex dynamics of a specific ecosystem comprised by the seasonal biomass and production patterns in a pelagic food web of a large, well-studied lake. We parameterised our allometric trophic network model of 24 guilds and 107 feeding relationships using the lakes food web structure, initial spring biomasses and body-masses. Adding activity respiration, the detrital loop, minimal abiotic forcing, prey resistance and several empirically observed rates substantially increased the model's fit to the observed seasonal dynamics and the size-abundance distribution. This process illuminates a promising approach towards improving food-web theory and dynamic models of specific habitats.

AB One of the challenges for large-scale, long-term ecological assessments lies in the integration of faunal datasets. A comparison was made between various ways of analysing benthic macrofaunal datasets using both taxon names as well as functional traits. The sampling stations were located on both sides of the average location of the Polar Front in the Barents Sea, and included the Spitsbergen Bank, slope areas and the deeper basins Storfjord Trough and Hopen Trough. Taxon richness and overall faunal biomass were highest at the shallowest stations, and lowest in the depressions and ice-influenced areas. The overall functioning of the faunal communities reflected the habitat type. In the trough areas, the sediment mixing depth was greatest, reflecting the bioturbatory activities of the fauna. The shallow, gravelly, erosion areas on the Spitsbergen Bank supported mostly surface-active taxa, consistent with the relatively low biological mixing depths. The mixed sediments of the slope environments supported a mixture of surface-active and bioturbating taxa. Functional trait coding offers an additional tool for mesoscale characterisation of communities, particularly for large-scale or long-term datasets, where taxonomic identifications may not be compatible. The results are discussed in terms of future research needs, in light of changing ecological conditions in the Barents Sea, as well as the need for refining environmental assessment tools.

AB 1. The species composition of stream fish assemblages changes across the longitudinal fluvial gradient of large river basins. These changes may reflect both zonation in species distributions and environmental filtering of fish traits as stream environments change from the uplands to the lowlands of large catchments. Previous research has shown that taxonomic diversity generally increases in larger, lowland streams, and the River Continuum Concept, the River Habitat Template and other frameworks have provided expectations for what functional groups of fishes should predominate in certain stream types. However, studies addressing the functional trait composition of fish assemblages across large regions are lacking, particularly in tropical river basins.
   2. We examined functional trait-environment relationships and functional diversity of stream fish assemblages in the Rio Grijalva Basin in southern Mexico. Traits linked to feeding, locomotion and life history strategy were measured in fishes from streams throughout the catchment, from highland headwaters to broad, lowland streams. Relationships between functional traits and environmental variables at local and landscape scales were examined using multivariate ordination, and the convex hull volume of trait space occupied by fish assemblages was calculated as a measure of functional diversity.
   3. Although there were a few exceptions, functional diversity of assemblages increased with species richness along the gradient from uplands to lowlands within the Grijalva Basin. Traits related to swimming, habitat preference and food resource use were associated with both local (e.g. substratum type, pool availability) and landscape-scale (e. g. forest cover) environmental variables.
   4. Along with taxonomic structure and diversity, the functional composition of fish assemblages changed across the longitudinal fluvial gradient of the basin. Trait-environment relationships documented in this study partially confirmed theoretical expectations and revealed patterns that may help in developing a better understanding of general functional responses of fish assemblages to environmental change.

AB Nutrient cycles in both terrestrial and many freshwater habitats are fueled by terrestrial detritus. However, direct comparisons of decomposition processes in these environments are scarce. Aiming at shedding light on similarities and differences in these processes in different habitats, we studied decomposition of low-quality versus high-quality detritus through the action of shredders versus grazers in aquatic versus terrestrial microcosms under controlled climatic conditions. Decomposition processes were most strongly affected by whether they took place in the terrestrial or the aquatic environment: Leaching resulted in a rapid mass loss of detritus in the aquatic environment, and detritus traits became less pronounced over time. Thus, breakdown was mediated through dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water but through particulate organic matter (POM) on land. Litter mass loss and the promoting effects of detritivores on mass loss also depended on the environment, but shredders always had a greater effect than grazers. Both litter and detritivore diversity were overall of little relevance for litter mass loss, but more so in the aquatic than the terrestrial environment. By contrast, the influence of detritivores on microbes was stronger in water than on land, but effects depended on the litter type. The type of both litter and detritivores, however, was less significant in the aquatic than in the terrestrial environment, possibly due to leaching and abiotic processing of litter during early decomposition, resulting in diminishing differences between litter types. We conclude that the habitat type shapes the dynamics of leaf litter decomposition. Heavy leaching (in the aquatic environment) shortens initial decomposition phases and dislocates the degradation of easily accessible compounds in the form of DOM from the leaves into the water column. Consequently, initial interspecific differences in litter quality diminish, and both functional differences in, and diversity of, both litter and detritivores become less important than in the terrestrial environment.

AB The rate of information collection generated by metagenomics is uncoupled with its meaningful ecological interpretation. New analytical approaches based on functional trait-based ecology may help to bridge this gap and extend the trait approach to the community level in vast and complex environmental genetic data sets. Here, we explored a set of community traits that range from nucleotidic to genomic properties in 53 metagenomic aquatic samples from the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition. We found significant differences between the community profile derived from the commonly used 16S rRNA gene and from the functional trait set. The traits proved to be valuable ecological markers by discriminating between marine ecosystems (coastal vs. open ocean) and between oceans (Atlantic vs. Indian vs. Pacific). Intertrait relationships were also assessed, and we propose some that could be further used as habitat descriptors or indicators of artefacts during sample processing. Overall, the approach presented here may help to interpret metagenomics data to gain a full understanding of microbial community patterns in a rigorous ecological framework.

AB Hydrophytes generally exhibit highly acquisitive leaf economics. However, a range of growth forms is evident, from small, free-floating and rapidly growing Lemniden to large, broad-leaved Nymphaeiden, denoting variability in adaptive strategies. Traits used to classify adaptive strategies in terrestrial species, such as canopy height, are not applicable to hydrophytes. We hypothesize that hydrophyte leaf size traits and economics exhibit sufficient overlap with terrestrial species to allow a common classification of plant functional types, sensu Grimes CSR theory.
   Leaf morpho-functional traits were measured for 61 species from 47 water bodies in lowland continental, sub-alpine and alpine bioclimatic zones in southern Europe and compared against the full leaf economics spectrum and leaf size range of terrestrial herbs, and between hydrophyte growth forms.
   Hydrophytes differed in the ranges and mean values of traits compared with herbs, but principal components analysis (PCA) demonstrated that both groups shared axes of trait variability: PCA1 encompassed size variation (area and mass), and PCA2 ranged from relatively dense, carbon-rich leaves to nitrogen-rich leaves of high specific leaf area (SLA). Most growth forms exhibited trait syndromes directly equivalent to herbs classified as R adapted, although Nymphaeiden ranged between C and SR adaptation.
   Our findings support the hypothesis that hydrophyte adaptive strategy variation reflects fundamental trade-offs in economics and size that govern all plants, and that hydrophyte adaptive strategies can be directly compared with terrestrial species by combining leaf economics and size traits.

AB Aim The highly endemic fishes of the arid Southwest USA have been heavily impacted by human activities resulting in one of the most threatened fish faunas in the world. The aim of this study was to examine the patterns and drivers of taxonomic and functional beta diversity of freshwater fish in the Lower Colorado River Basin across the 20th century.
   Location Lower Colorado River Basin (LCRB).
   Methods The taxonomic and functional similarities of watersheds were quantified to identify patterns of biotic homogenization or differentiation over the period 1900-1999. Path analysis was used to identify the relative influence of dam density, urban land use, precipitation regimes and non-native species richness on observed changes in fish faunal composition.
   Results The fish fauna of the LCRB has become increasingly homogenized, both taxonomically (1.1% based on beta(sim) index) and functionally (6.2% based on Bray-Curtis index), over the 20th century. The rate of homogenization varied substantially; range declines of native species initially caused taxonomic differentiation (-7.9% in the 1960s), followed by marginal homogenization (observed in the 1990s) in response to an influx of non-native species introductions. By contrast, functional homogenization of the basin was evident considerably earlier (in the 1950s) because of the widespread introduction of non-native species sharing similar suites of biological traits. Path analysis revealed that both taxonomic and functional homogenization were positively related to the direct and indirect (facilitation by dams and urbanization) effects of non-native species richness.
   Main conclusions Our study simultaneously examines rates of change in multiple dimensions of the homogenization process. For the endemic fish fauna of the LCRB, we found that the processes of taxonomic and functional homogenization are highly dynamic over time, varying both in terms of the magnitude and rate of change over the 20th century.

AB Studies on disturbance regimes involving carabid beetles have mainly focused on forest habitats. We therefore decided to analyze the effects of disturbance on carabid communities in a wetland remnant (Lake Chiusi, central Italy). Results highlighted the presence of a disturbance gradient affecting the species richness and trait-displacement of carabid communities. Carabids were sampled with pitfall traps from March to October 2008 at nine randomly selected sample stations; a set of landscape attributes were also collected. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to link the distribution of carabid life-history traits and species richness with the most informative combination of landscape attributes. The first PCA axis (PC1) showed significant correlation with "distance to the lake shoreline" and "perimeter-area ratio", highlighting the presence of a disturbance-axis. The second and third axes accounted only for a trivial portion of the total variance. GLMMs revealed a progressive decrease in the number of hygrophilous species from the core of the wetland to its outer areas. Similar trends were observed for species richness and for predator species with good dispersal ability and larval period in summer. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account community-wide functional implications in landscape ecology studies.

AB While the importance of biotic interactions in shaping zooplankton communities has long been established in lentic environments, river plankton is traditionally thought to be primarily abiotically constrained. The role of interactions among zooplankters has thus only occasionally been examined and mainly regarded as secondary or negligible in rivers. This study addresses the question whether and under which conditions biotic interactions within the zooplankton can become the chief drivers of community structure and dynamics in riverine environments. A short-term, high-frequency sampling campaign was performed in the potamal reach of the Po River (Italy). To test for the presence of association patterns among zooplankters, which might be suggestive of potential trophic interactions (predation/competition), taxa were aggregated into functional groups according to their feeding ecology, and time series of their abundances were analysed by means of a variance ratio test, which revealed the occurrence of compensatory dynamics among functional groups under low and stable, although truly advective, discharge conditions. Evidence on the importance of predatorprey interactions and intra-population regulation mechanisms also came from further analyses of the dominant predators gut contents and of the main prey population dynamics. Our results show that, under certain conditions, zooplankton exhibit internal, self-regulatory mechanisms also in the main current of large rivers. The view of riverine zooplankton as a mere assemblage of taxa exclusively abiotically controlled is therefore oversimplified.

AB The role of habitat disturbance on biodiversity is central as it promotes changes in ecological systems. That said, still little is known about the functional consequences of such changes. Functional diversity can be used to revealing more mechanistically the disturbance effects on communities by considering the richness and the distribution of traits among the species. Here we analyzed the response of functional and species diversity of ground beetles to flood disturbance to better understand the functioning of alluvial invertebrate communities.
   Ground beetles were sampled in periodically flooded grasslands along the Elbe River in Germany. We used generalized linear mixed effects models to unveil the relationships between flood disturbance, species and functional diversity, respectively. We measured different components of functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, dispersion, and divergence) and analyzed species diversity by means of rarefied species richness, abundances, evenness and Simpson's diversity.
   We found contrasting relationships in that most species diversity measures peaked at highest disturbance levels, while most functional diversity measures decreased with increasing disturbance intensities.
   Inversed relationships between species and functional diversity are rarely observed, as most studies report on positive correlations. We explain increasing species diversity with a higher amount of resources available in highly disturbed sites. Decreasing functional diversity is best explained through the convergence of species traits by flood disturbance and uneven resource exploitation in highly disturbed plots (low functional evenness), suggesting strong impacts from functionally different generalist species in floodchannels. We show that the amount of resources available, and how these resources are exploited, play major roles in the functioning of floodplain ground beetle communities.

AB Despite the intensity with which ecological information involving habitat complexity has been amassed to date, much remains to be revealed for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanics and implications of the structural complexity of habitats and its influences on ecological communities. This review examines the multi-faceted characteristics of habitat complexity, focusing in particular on aquatic ecosystems. Habitat complexity in aquatic systems is characterised by at least five different traits of physical structure: (1) spatial scales, (2) diversity of complexity-generating physical (structural) elements, (3) spatial arrangement of elements, (4) sizes of elements, (5) abundance/density of elements. Of these five traits, the concept of fractal dimension fully encompasses only the last one; in this sense, habitat complexity is more complex than what fractal measures represent. It is therefore important to investigate exactly which traits of habitat structure are exerting influences on organisms/communities. We hypothesise that, where an entire range of possible fractal dimension D is considered, intermediate levels of D are most likely to be associated with the highest level of biodiversity, to which the body size spectra of assemblages would have a close bearing. In most aquatic ecosystems, broadly two-dimensional structures of bottom substrate at the scale of 1-10 m mean that the addition of vertical, three dimensional structures almost always implies an increase in both the 'diversity' and 'abundance' components of structural elements, resulting in more habitats being made available to organisms of different sizes and functional designs. The conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems would be facilitated by rigorous assessments of linkages between habitat complexity and aquatic communities, for which an integrative approach to habitat complexity seems to offer a useful and versatile framework.

AB Biological traits are increasingly used for describing ecological functioning of stream benthic assemblages. Such approaches associate information on species distribution to their biological characteristics (e.g. life history, physiology, dispersal ability) providing a biological trait profile of communities. They may complement structural bioassessment measures using taxonomic composition by providing indirect information on stream ecological functioning, with the additional advantage of being less constrained by biogeographic differences. A multivariate predictive model, that provides a site-specific list of expected taxa at least disturbed conditions was recently developed for the bioassessment of Portuguese streams. Here, we tested if the inclusion of trait information in the model would also enable the detection of most common anthropogenic disturbances (i.e., organic contamination, hydrological disturbance) and provide diagnostic hints for causal relationships.
   We used existing information on 11 invertebrate biological traits and their 54 categories to convert the observed and expected taxonomic composition at several test sites into expected and observed trait compositions. The first three axes of a normalised PCA (Principal Components Analysis) performed on disturbance variables accounted for 42.7% of explained variability. The proportion of variance in disturbance explained by the three types of trait-based metrics (overall observed/expected trait composition, trait-category profile difference and traits profile dissimilarity) ranged between 9% and 32%. Our predictions made on the response of observed to expected trait categories for organic contamination were generally confirmed and demonstrated that disturbances resulted in a change in those traits conferring species resilience capacity and sensitivity to oxygen depletion, as well as a shift in the proportion of animals with filter-feeding behaviour. Variations in observed to expected trait-category differences showed that even a small increase in organic contamination led to a significant change in the biological trait profile, as expected. By contrast, only two out of 11 trait category predictions were confirmed for hydrological disturbance. Finally, we found that 4/11 and 9/11 observed to expected trait differences showed a significant deviation with organic contamination and hydrological disturbance, respectively, whereas all 11 observed to expected trait differences responded to overall disturbance. These changes in trait profiles reflect changes in the performance of invertebrate communities to cope with disturbance, which potentially can alter ecosystem functioning (e.g., energy flow or chemical cycling). In conclusion, the integration of biological trait information in an AUSRIVAS type predictive model allowed the detection of a general disturbance gradient and particularly organic contamination, which indicates their value in addition to taxonomic-based assessment.

AB Many plant seeds and invertebrates can survive passage through the digestive system of birds, which may lead to long distance dispersal (endozoochory) in case of prolonged retention by moving vectors. Endozoochorous dispersal by waterbirds has nowadays been documented for many aquatic plant seeds, algae and dormant life stages of aquatic invertebrates. Anecdotal information indicates that endozoochory is also possible for fully functional, active aquatic organisms, a phenomenon that we here address experimentally using aquatic snails. We fed four species of aquatic snails to mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and monitored snail retrieval and survival over time. One of the snail species tested was found to survive passage through the digestive tract of mallards as fully functional adults. Hydrobia (Peringia) ulvae survived up to five hours in the digestive tract. This suggests a maximum potential transport distance of up to 300 km may be possible if these snails are taken by flying birds, although the actual dispersal distance greatly depends on additional factors such as the behavior of the vectors. We put forward that more organisms that acquired traits for survival in stochastic environments such as wetlands, but not specifically adapted for endozoochory, may be sufficiently equipped to successfully pass a bird's digestive system. This may be explained by a digestive trade-off in birds, which maximize their net energy intake rate rather than digestive efficiency, since higher efficiency comes with the cost of prolonged retention times and hence reduces food intake. The resulting lower digestive efficiency allows species like aquatic snails, and potentially other fully functional organisms without obvious dispersal adaptations, to be transported internally. Adopting this view, endozoochorous dispersal may be more common than up to now thought.

AB Functional traits (FT) offer a new framework to understand the ecology of organisms and overcome taxonomic difficulties that currently limit the study of minute soil taxa. FT are likely to be selected by environmental filters and hence they may provide more direct information on ecosystem characteristics than the species composition of a community.
   We tested the potential of testate amoeba (TA) functional traits as bioindicators of selected ecosystem processes in the context of a restored floodplain in north-western Switzerland. The floodplain was divided into six functional process zones (FPZs) associated to distinct post-restoration successional stages. We selected TA FT and computed three functional indices: functional richness (FRic), divergence (FDiv), evenness (FEve), and dispersion (FDis). We then compared the patterns of functional indices and classical diversity indices such as species richness, diversity and evenness. We assessed whether traits converged or were over-dispersed in the different FPZs using a randomization procedure. Finally, we related environmental variables and functional traits using the "Fourth Corner" statistic. This procedure enabled us to highlight relations that can potentially be used for bioindication. Promising candidates include the relationships between shell biovolume and vegetation structure and between shell compression and plant litter input variables. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB We examined the effect of species identity on ecosystem function across an environmental gradient by manipulating the relative dominance of three freshwater mussel species with divergent thermal preferences in mesocosms across a temperature gradient (15, 25, 35 degrees C). We measured a suite of individual performance (oxygen consumption, nutrient excretion) and ecosystem response metrics (community, water column, benthic gross primary production and nutrient concentrations) to determine if species performance across temperatures was governed by 1) physiological responses to temperature, 2) species interactions associated with dominant species, or 3) context-dependent species interactions related to temperature (interaction of 1 and 2). Our results demonstrate that environmental context (temperature) combined with the functional traits of dominant species interactively influence the performance and services provided by other species, and that these shifts can have heightened effects on multiple compartments within an ecosystem. Therefore, in addition to declines in species richness, shifts in community dominance also should be considered when interpreting the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on the structure and functioning of ecosystems.

AB A family structured population of 325 pigs (females and barrows) was produced as an intercross between 2 commercial sire lines and was subjected to a systematic transcriptome analysis of LM samples obtained shortly after slaughter. Additionally, measurements of meat quality traits of fresh and cooked loin were gathered from the same animals. The transcriptome analysis was achieved by microarray hybridization, using a custom repertoire of 15,000 6mer DNA probes targeting transcripts expressed in growing pig skeletal muscle. These data allowed us to estimate the heritability of expression abundance for each of the quantified RNA species. The abundance of 9,765 RNA was estimated as heritable with a false discovery rate of 5%, from which 1,174 were deemed as highly heritable (h(2) > 0.50). We also observed a large number of transcripts whose LM expression abundance is genetically correlated with 4 meat quality traits: the loin pH measured at 45 min postmortem (pH45), 253 transcripts; the loin cooking loss (CL), 134 transcripts; the cooked loin shear force (SFc), 184 transcripts; and the loin color redness (a*) value, 190 transcripts. Heritable and meat quality genetically correlated transcripts showed an over-representation of biological processes involved in the induction of apoptosis (genetically correlated with CL), complement activation (genetically correlated with SFc), glucose metabolism (genetically correlated with a*), and cation channel activity (genetically correlated with pH45). Overall, the biological functions highlighted in the highly heritable transcripts and the lack of transcript that would be genetically correlated with LM glycolytic potential suggest that the genetic variability of the LM postmortem transcriptome is focused on muscle tissue response to postmortem ischemia and reflects more distantly the antemortem muscle physiology. Because of the contrasting distributions of the genetic correlations between LM RNA concentrations and the different meat quality traits studied, indirect selection strategies of meat quality traits based on measurements of selected LM RNA species could be only proposed for a subset of the analyzed meat characteristics (pH45, SFc, a*, CL). A substantial improvement in the efficiency of selection for these meat quality traits could result from measuring muscle RNA concentrations on selection candidates, if the same genetic parameters can be verified using in vivo-sampled muscles.

AB Inverse trophic cascades are a well explored and common consequence of the local depletion or extinction of top predators in natural ecosystems. Despite a large body of research, the cascading effects of predator removal on ecosystem functions are not as well understood. Developing microcosm experiments, we explored food web changes in trophic structure and ecosystem functioning following biomass removal of top predators in representative temperate and tropical rock pool communities that contained similar assemblages of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. We observed changes in species abundances following predator removal in both temperate and tropical communities, in line with expected inverse effects of a trophic cascade, where predation release benefits the predator's preys and competitors and impacts the preys of the latter. We also observed several changes at the community and ecosystem levels including a decrease in total abundance and mean trophic level of the community, and changes in chlorophyll-a and total dissolved particles. Our results also showed an increase in variability of both community and ecosystem processes following the removal of predators. These results illustrate how predator removal can lead to inverse trophic cascades both in structural and functioning properties, and can increase variability of ecosystem processes. Although observed patterns were consistent between tropical and temperate communities following an inverse cascade pattern, changes were more pronounced in the temperate community. Therefore, aquatic food webs may have inherent traits that condition ecosystem responses to changes in top-down trophic control and render some aquatic ecosystems especially sensitive to the removals of top predators.

AB Assessing the sensitivity of different species to chemicals is one of the key points in predicting the effects of toxic compounds in the environment. Trait-based predicting methods have proved to be extremely efficient for assessing the sensitivity of macroinvertebrates toward compounds with non specific toxicity (narcotics). Nevertheless, predicting the sensitivity of organisms toward compounds with specific toxicity is much more complex, since it depends on the mode of action of the chemical. The aim of this work was to predict the sensitivity of several freshwater macroinvertebrates toward three classes of plant protection products: organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids. Two databases were built: one with sensitivity data (retrieved, evaluated and selected from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ECOTOX database) and the other with biological traits. Aside from the "traditional" traits usually considered in ecological analysis (i.e. body size, respiration technique, feeding habits, etc.), multivariate analysis was used to relate the sensitivity of organisms to some other characteristics which may be involved in the process of intoxication. Results confirmed that, besides traditional biological traits, related to uptake capability (e.g. body size and body shape) some traits more related to particular metabolic characteristics or patterns have a good predictive capacity on the sensitivity to these kinds of toxic substances. For example, behavioral complexity, assumed as an indicator of nervous system complexity, proved to be an important predictor of sensitivity towards these compounds. These results confirm the need for more complex traits to predict effects of highly specific substances. One key point for achieving a complete mechanistic understanding of the process is the choice of traits, whose role in the discrimination of sensitivity should be clearly interpretable, and not only statistically significant.

AB Background: As in any vertebrate, heads of fishes are densely packed with functions. These functions often impose conflicting mechanical demands resulting in trade-offs in the species-specific phenotype. When phenotypical traits are linked to gender-specific parental behavior, we expect sexual differences in these trade-offs. This study aims to use mouthbrooding cichlids as an example to test hypotheses on evolutionary trade-offs between intricately linked traits that affect different aspects of fitness. We focused on the oral apparatus, which is not only equipped with features used to feed and breathe, but is also used for the incubation of eggs. We used this approach to study mouthbrooding as part of an integrated functional system with diverging performance requirements and to explore gender-specific selective environments within a species.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Because cichlids are morphologically very diverse, we hypothesize that the implications of the added constraint of mouthbrooding will primarily depend on the dominant mode of feeding of the studied species. To test this, we compared the trade-off for two maternal mouthbrooding cichlid species: a "suction feeder'' (Haplochromis piceatus) and a "biter'' (H. fischeri). The comparison of morphology and performance of both species revealed clear interspecific and intersex differences. Our observation that females have larger heads was interpreted as a possible consequence of the fact that in both the studied species mouthbrooding is done by females only. As hypothesized, the observed sexual dimorphism in head shape is inferred as being suboptimal for some aspects of the feeding performance in each of the studied species. Our comparison also demonstrated that the suction feeding species had smaller egg clutches and more elongated eggs.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our findings support the hypothesis that there is a trade-off between mouthbrooding and feeding performance in the two studied haplochromine cichlids, stressing the importance of including species-specific information at the gender level when addressing interspecific functional/morphological differences.

AB The factors promoting the evolution of parental care strategies have been extensively studied in experiment and theory. However, most attempts to examine parental care in an evolutionary context have evaluated broad taxonomic categories. The explosive and recent diversifications of East African cichlid fishes offer exceptional opportunities to study the evolution of various life history traits based on species-level phylogenies. The Xenotilapia lineage within the endemic Lake Tanganyika cichlid tribe Ectodini comprises species that display either biparental or maternal only brood care and hence offers a unique opportunity to study the evolution of distinct parental care strategies in a phylogenetic framework. In order to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among 16 species of this lineage we scored 2,478 Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) across the genome. We find that the Ectodini genus Enantiopus is embedded within the genus Xenotilapia and that during 2.5 to 3 million years of evolution within the Xenotilapia clade there have been 3-5 transitions from maternal only to biparental care. While most previous models suggest that uniparental care (maternal or paternal) arose from biparental care, we conclude from our species-level analysis that the evolution of parental care strategies is not only remarkably fast, but much more labile than previously expected.

AB The response of ecological communities to environmental disturbances depends not just on the number of species they contain but also on the functional diversity of the constituent species; greater variation in the tolerance of species to different environmental disturbances is generally thought to confer greater resistance to the community. Here, I investigate how the functional diversity of communities changes with environmental disturbances. Specifically, I assume that there is variation in traits among species that confer tolerance or sensitivity to environmental disturbances. When a disturbance occurs, variation in species tolerances causes changes in the relative abundances of species, which in turn changes the average tolerance of the community. For example, if tolerance to an environmental disturbance is conferred by large body size, then the environmental disturbance should be expected to increase the average body size of individuals in the community. Despite this expectation, ecological interactions among species can affect the average community response. For example, if larger species are also strong competitors with each other, then this might reduce the increase in average body size in the community, because interspecific competition limits the grow in population density of large bodied species. Similarly, when disturbances affect multiple traits, the covariance in the distribution of trait values among species may restrict the response of any one trait; if two traits provide tolerance to the same disturbance but negatively covary among species, then the response of one trait will limit the response of the other trait at the community level. Using a Lotka-Volterra model for competitive communities, I derive general formulae that generate explicit predictions about the changes in average trait values in a community subject to environmental disturbances. These formulae demonstrate that competition can impede the change in average community trait values. However, the impediment is not considerable in comparison to the predominant factors of trait variances and species selection effects when species with the most similar trait values also experience the greatest interspecific competition. Similarly, negative covariances among different traits that confer resistance to the same environmental disturbance will impede their responses. I illustrate these results using phytoplankton data from a whole-lake experiment in which manipulation to the zooplankton community created a disturbance to the phytoplankton that changed the selective consumption of large vs. small phytoplankton.

AB Quantitative genetic studies in natural populations are of growing interest to speciation research since divergence is often believed to arise through micro-evolutionary change, caused by natural selection on functional morphological traits. The species flock of cichlid fishes in Africa's oldest lake, Lake Tanganyika, offers a rare opportunity to study this process. Using the cichlid species Tropheus moorii, we assessed the potential for microevolution in a set of morphological traits by estimating their quantitative genetic basis of variation. Two approaches were employed: (1) estimation of trait heritabilities (h(2)) in situ from a sample of wild caught fish, and (2) estimation of h(2) from first generation offspring produced in a semi-natural breeding experiment. In both cases, microsatellite data were used to infer pedigree structure among the sampled individuals and estimates of h(2) were made using an animal model approach. Although power was limited by the pedigree structures estimated (particularly in the wild caught sample), we nonetheless demonstrate the presence of significant additive genetic variance for aspects of morphology that, in the cichlid species Tropheus moorii, are expected to be functionally and ecologically important, and therefore likely targets of natural selection. We hypothesize that traits showing significant additive genetic variance, such as the mouth position have most likely played a key role in the adaptive evolution of the cichlid fish Tropheus moorii.

AB Nonnative species may change ecosystem functionality at the expense of native species. Here, we examine the similarity of functional traits of native and nonnative submersed aquatic plants (SAP) in an aquatic ecosystem. We used field and airborne imaging spectroscopy and isotope ratios of SAP species in the SacramentoSan Joaquin Delta, California (USA) to assess species identification, chlorophyll (Chl) concentration, and differences in photosynthetic efficiency. Spectral separability between species occurs primarily in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions, which is associated with morphological and physiological differences. Nonnatives had significantly higher Chl, carotene, and anthocyanin concentrations than natives and had significantly higher photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and d13C values. Results show nonnative SAPs are functionally dissimilar to native SAPs, having wider leaf blades and greater leaf area, dense and evenly distributed vertical canopies, and higher pigment concentrations. Results suggest that nonnatives also use a facultative C4-like photosynthetic pathway, allowing efficient photosynthesis in high-light and low-light environments. Differences in plant functionality indicate that nonnative SAPs have a competitive advantage over native SAPs as a result of growth form and greater light-use efficiency that promotes growth under different light conditions, traits affecting system-wide species distributions and community composition.

AB Aim We quantify biotic homogenization of fish fauna caused by the elimination of a natural barrier between two freshwater ecoregions. We also evaluated fish introductions by different mechanisms such as aquaculture, angling and the aquarium trade in the homogenization of fish assemblages. The relative importance of native extinctions in the homogenization process was assessed by simulating the exclusion of threatened species in the data set.
   Location Parana River, south-eastern South America.
   Methods A fish species list of the Parana River Basin was organized in a subset of species distributions, according to pre- and post-introductions caused by the elimination of the natural barrier and by other mechanisms. Biotic homogenization was verified by the use of Jaccard's and Bray-Curtis's coefficients, Whittaker's beta diversity index, non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) and nonparametric tests.
   Results For all subsets of species distributions, we observed an increase in the number of non-native species in common related to the introductions. Between 40 and 52% of the species currently present in the Upper Parana Basin dispersed upstream from the Lower Parana after the construction of Itaipu Dam, including at least 1 class, 2 orders, 4 families and 16 genera of fish. Jaccard's coefficient between the Upper and Lower Parana River increased by 6-7.5% only considering the Itaipu Dam influence and 10.5% considering all mechanisms of fish introductions. More than 50% of the increase in similarity was caused by the elimination of the barrier. Our results indicated functional homogenization related to large-bodied Siluriformes (catfish).
   Main conclusions Itaipu Lake flooded a natural barrier and allowed hydrologic connectivity between the Upper and Lower Parana River, and many fishes of the lower part of the river were able to colonize the upper stretches. The homogenization of the two assemblages between these adjacent aquatic regions was an unpredicted result of hydropower implementation. Introductions by dam can also shift longitudinal and latitudinal body size patterns (i.e. Bergmann's rule).

AB Ecological risk assessments mostly consider measures of community composition (structure) across large spatial scales. These assessments, using species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) or the relative species retention (RSR), may not be protective of ecosystem functions and services at smaller spatial scales. Here we examine how changes in biological traits, as proxy for ecosystem functions/services, at a fine spatial scale relate to larger scale assessment of structure. We use functional traits of stream insect species in south-east Australia in two habitats (riffle and edge/pool). We find that the protection of community structure in terms of 95% of species over multiple sites against adverse effects of salinity (as electrical conductivity) and turbidity will mostly, but not always, protect traits at smaller scales. Considering different combinations of trait modalities, contaminants and habitat, a mean of 17.5% (range 0%-36.8) of cases would result in under-protection of trait modalities despite protecting species composition (in terms of Jaccard's Index). This under-protection of trait modalities is only because of the different spatial scales that community structure and the traits were considered. We recommend that where the protection of biological traits, ecosystem functions or ecosystem services from stressors is a management goal, protective targets should not be solely set using measures of community structure such as SSDs or RSR. To protect both structural and functional attributes separate risk assessments should be done. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Phytoplankton are major primary producers in aquatic ecosystems and are sensitive to various aspects of global environmental change. They can respond through phenotypic plasticity, species sorting, genetic adaptation, or a combination of these processes. Here we present conceptual, experimental and theoretical ways to predict different phytoplankton responses to global change. Using phytoplankton ecological niches to predict their responses to multiple environmental stressors is a promising new approach. Functional traits of phytoplankton, such as resource utilization traits and tolerance curves for various environmental factors like temperature, can be used to define niches along major axes. Characterization of pairwise and higher dimension trade-offs among traits should help predict possible niche changes along multiple dimensions simultaneously. The potential for evolutionary responses to global change can be assessed using evolution experiments with individual strains, as well as in communities, because the responses may depend on the presence of competitors, grazers, and parasites. The evolutionary pressures induced by multiple stressors may have interactive effects and, thus, should be investigated simultaneously. Novel models of trait evolution in a community context should provide additional insights into potential adaptation trajectories under diverse global change scenarios.

AB Grapes are grown worldwide, on about 7.9 million ha, and are used to produce wine, raisins, juice, jam, concentrate, and seed oils, as well as fresh fruit. Grapes (Vitis sp.) are members of the Vitaceae. Vitis includes two subgenera, Euvitis (38 chromosomes) and Muscadinia (40 chromosomes), with about 60 species in total. The primary centers of species diversity are North America and East Asia. Scion cultivars are derived chiefly from the European grape, Vitis vinifera, which was domesticated ca. 6,000-10,000 years ago in the region between the Black and Caspian Seas. Grapes spread east into Asia and west into the Mediterranean region. Rootstocks were developed from North American species, including V. riparia, V. rupestris, and V. berlandieri. Scion breeding programs focus on the development of cultivars adapted to biotic and abiotic stress, with high fruit quality, and time of ripening during desirable periods of market demand. Fungal disease resistance is a primary goal of many programs, while cold hardy cultivars help extend the limits of grape cultivation. Rootstock breeding focuses on providing protection against phylloxera and nematodes as well as adaptation to high pH, low pH, and/or water-stressed conditions. Rootstocks should propagate easily by grafting and cuttings. New cultivars are more rapidly adapted in the raisin and table grape sectors than in the wine industry, although there are several notable examples of successful wine grape cultivars developed by breeding. The availability of two published genomic DNA sequences has stimulated numerous projects to further understand the function of the ca. 30,000 grapevine genes. Marker-assisted selection, primarily for disease resistance and seedlessness, is being applied in many breeding programs. Projects that focus on breeding seedless cultivars commonly use embryo rescue techniques, enabling the crossing of two seedless parents, to increase the percentage of seedlings that are seedless. Genetic transformation is a routine procedure and is being used for both functional analysis of gene action as well as directly for cultivar improvement (both scions and rootstocks), although transgenic grape cultivars currently are not in commercial production.

AB Apricot is in the Rosaceae family within the genus Prunus L., subgenus Prunophora Focke, and the section Armeniaca (Lam.) Koch. Depending on the classification system, the number of apricot species ranges from 3 to 12. Six distinct species are usually recognized: P. brigantina Vill., P. holosericeae Batal, P. armeniaca L., P. mandshurica (Maxim), P. sibirica L., Japanese apricot P. mume (Sieb.) Sieb. & Succ. Vavilov placed apricot in three centers of origin: the Chinese center (Central and Western China), the Central Asiatic center (Afghanistan, northwest India and Pakistan, Kashmir, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Xinjing province in China and western Tien-Shan), and the Near-Eastern center (interior of Asia Minor). Kostina further divided the cultivated apricot according to their adaptability into four major ecogeographical groups: (1) the Central Asian group, (2) the Iran-Caucasian group, (3) the European group, and (4) the Dzhungar-Zailij group. Many local cultivars are grown in the different areas and producing countries; however, these cultivars lack Important traits that needed by modern production and marketing systems. Breeding programs have and continue to develop cultivars with improved adaptability to the environment (temperature requirements, water deficit), extension of the harvest season, fruit quality for fresh consumption and processing, productivity, adequate tree size, and resistance to biotic stresses. The major objectives in apricot breeding programs are resistance to sharka caused by Plum Pox Virus, brown rot caused by Monilinia spp., bacterial diseases caused by Pseudomonas spp. and Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni (Smith), Chlorotic Leaf Roll Phytoplasma, and Apricot Decline Syndrome. Among these, PPV is the most limiting factor in Europe and much work has to be invested in developing PPV-resistant apricot cultivars. Molecular markers have been developed in apricot and used mainly for construction of linkage maps and genetic diversity studies.

AB As apex predators, chondrichthyans, or cartilaginous fishes, hold an important position within a range of aquatic ecosystems and influence the balance between species' abundance and biodiversity. Having been in existence for over 400 million years and representing the earliest stages of the evolution of jawed vertebrates, this group also covers a diverse range of eco-morphotypes, occupying both marine and freshwater habitats. The class Chondrichthyes is divided into two subclasses: the Elasmobranchii (sharks, skates, and rays) and the Holocephali (elephant sharks and chimaeras). However, many of their life history traits, such as low fecundity, the production of small numbers of highly precocious young, slow growth rates, and late maturity, make them highly susceptible to human exploitation. To mitigate the negative effects of human impacts, it is important that we understand the sensory strategies that elasmobranchs use for navigating within their environment, forming reproductive aggregations, feeding, and even communicating. One approach to investigate the sensory bases of their behavior is to examine the peripheral sense organs mediating vision, olfaction, gustation, lateral line, electroreception, and audition in a large range of species in order to identify specific adaptations, the range of sensitivity thresholds, and the compromise between sensory spatial resolution and sensitivity. In addition, we can quantitatively assess the convergence of sensory input to the central nervous system and the relative importance of different sensory modalities. Using a comparative approach and often a combination of anatomical, electrophysiological, and molecular techniques, significant variation has been identified in the spatial and chromatic sampling of the photoreceptors in the eye, the surface area and the number of olfactory lamellae within the nasal cavity, the level of gustatory sampling within the oral cavity, the type and innervation of neuromasts of the lateral line system, the distribution of electroreceptive pores over the head, and the morphology of the inner ear. These results are presented in the context of predictions of sensory capabilities for species living in a range of ecological niches, what further research is needed, and how this sensory input may be a predictor of behavior.

AB The aim of this study was to explore the differences between taxa groups with different ecological strategies for persistence, regarding their responses to environmental factors and seasonal variation. We studied the relationship between the seasonal patterns and habitat attributes of the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) and the Colepotera, Heteroptera (CH) assemblages. Sampling was carried out in May, July and October of 2009. Samples were taken according to the AQEM protocol at 10 stream sections in the Mecsek Mountains. Based on multivariate analyses (RDA, pRDA), distinctive differences were found between the EPT and the CH taxa groups regarding their response to local chemical variables and variables describing the riparian vegetation. The measured environmental variables had a higher relative influence on the distribution patterns of EPT and CH assemblages than spatial variation of species patterns. The physical structure of aquatic habitats, including the type of bedrock, had greater effects on CH than EPT patterns, whereas the structure of riparian vegetation was more important for EPT than CH. Average density and average taxon richness of EPT were seasonally variable, but CH assemblages were not.

AB Mixed beds of Ophiocomina nigra and Ophiothrix fragilis (Echinodermata, Ophiuroidea) are usually predominated by O. fragilis and are reported to be stable over time. The Bay of Brest (Brittany, France) is a highly productive ecosystem where both species co-occur in the main central part. Using a geostatistical approach, we tested for changes in O. nigra and O. fragilis density and total biomass patterns between 1987 and 2011. Our results highlighted an increase in O. nigra population size and the induction of a spatial shift of the co-occurring O. fragilis. O. nigra increased similar to 5 times in density and covered almost all the study area, while its density-dependent biomass increased similar to 3 times (22 t km(-2), ash-free dry mass) between 1987 and 2011. Overall, the O. fragilis population decreased in density by similar to 30%, but its total biomass did not change over time. The current distribution pattern revealed a clear spatial exclusion of O. fragilis from the central part of the study area toward the southern part, overlapping beds of dead slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata, which were formerly considered to be the dominant suspension-feeder species in the bay. The success of O. nigra colonization is linked to its biological and functional traits, as well as deep changes in food supply over the studied period. Ecological consequences of such a large change in the benthic compartment of the bay are explored in the light of associated changes in environmental patterns.

AB The use of river-types is of practical value, serving as groups for which assessment procedures can be developed and applied. An abiotic typology was set by the Portuguese Water Agency, mainly based on 6 major morphoclimatic regions. However, to be biologically meaningful, this typology should fit the distribution patterns of the biological quality elements communities proposed in Water Framework Directive under the lowest possible human pressure. This study aimed to identify and characterize fish-based geographical groups for continental Portugal and their environmental and geographical discriptors, using taxonomic and functional traits. Sampling took place between 2004 and 2006 during Spring. Fish fauna from 155 reference sites was analysed using a multivariate approach. Cluster Analysis on fish composition identified 10 fish-groups, expressing a clear correspondence to the river basin level, due to the restrict basin distribution of many species. Groups showed a wider aggregation in 4 regions with a larger geographical correspondence, statistically supported by Similarity Analysis, both on fish composition and mostly on fish metrics/guilds. Principal Components Analysis revealed major environmental drivers associated to fish-groups and fish-regions. Fish-groups were hierarchically grouped over major and local regions, expressing a large-scale response to a North-South environmental gradient defined by temperature, precipitation, mineralization and altitude, and a regional scale response mainly to drainage area and flow discharge. From North to South, fish-regions were related to the morphoclimatic regions. Results contributed to reduce redundance in abiotic river-types and set the final typology for Portuguese rivers, constituting a fundamental tool for planning and managing water resources.

AB We examined the influence of the Precambrian Shield, a broad-scale geological feature of North America, on stream abiotic conditions and on the associated fish communities relative to an adjacent series of sites located on sedimentary geology (i.e., "off-Shield" streams) in south-central Ontario, Canada. Constrained and unconstrained multivariate analyses were used to quantify relationships in fish species composition, abiotic variables, and fish species' functional traits. The results showed that for low-order lotic systems, streams located on the Precambrian Shield had fish communities that were distinctly different from those of off-Shield streams. Lotic fish communities on the Shield were associated with higher velocity, increased amounts of instream woody debris, higher dissolved oxygen, and shrub-marsh landscapes. In contrast, off-Shield communities were characterized by higher conductivity, alkalinity, water temperature, and turbidity and were frequently surrounded by meadow and cultivated or pastured land. In general, off-Shield sites were more species rich and were associated with species preferring a wide variety of habitats, whereas Shield sites were associated with a subset of the regional species pool that had more specific habitat associations. Overall, our results show that these sharp geological discontinuities result in distinct abiotic environments and fish communities between Shield and off-Shield low-order lotic systems within a small geographic range.

AB Ohio is an eastern USA state that historically was >70% covered in upland and mixed coniferous forest; about 60% of it glaciated by the Wisconsinan glacial episode. Its stonefly fauna has been studied in piecemeal fashion until now. The assemblage of Ohio stoneflies was assessed from over 4,000 records accumulated from 18 institutions, new collections, and trusted literature sources. Species richness totaled 102 with estimators Chao2 and ICE Mean predicting 105.6 and 106.4, respectively. Singletons and doubletons totaled 18 species. All North American families were represented with Perlidae accounted for the highest number of species at 34. The family Peltoperlidae contributed a single species. Most species had univoltine-fast life cycles with the vast majority emerging in summer, although there was a significant component of winter stoneflies. Nine United States Geological Survey hierarchical drainage units level 6 (HUC6) were used to stratify specimen data. Species richness was significantly related to the number of unique HUC6 locations, but there was no relationship with HUC6 drainage area. A nonparametric multidimensional scaling analysis found that larger HUC6s in the western part of the state had similar assemblages with lower species richness that were found to align with more savanna and wetland habitat. Other drainages having richer assemblages were aligned with upland deciduous and mixed coniferous forests of the east and south where slopes were higher. The Ohio assemblage was most similar to the well-studied fauna of Indiana (88 spp.) and Kentucky (108 spp.), two neighboring states. Many rare species and several high quality stream reaches should be considered for greater protection.

AB The seasonal variation of seston stable isotopes signature of carbon (delta C-13) in Lake Maggiore during 2008 was related to seasonal variation of the lake phytoplankton community, investigated in terms of phytoplankton taxonomic groups, morpho-functional groups (MBFG), cell size classes and cell shape classes. Three open water stations were selected to reflect truly pelagic, influenced by littoral and riverine carbon sources: phytoplankton samples were collected from two water depths, 0-20 m and 25-50 m. Among stations differences in delta C-13 signatures of seston were statistically non significant, confirming that allochthonous input may become important only after exceptional rainfall events. Nonparametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) was utilized to identify among the phytoplankton parameters (taxonomic groups, MBFG, cell shapes, cell sizes) which were the best predictors of the PC variation. Bacillariophyceae and two morpho-functional groups, Group 6 (non-flagellated organisms with siliceous exoskeletons) and Group 3 (large filamentous algae with aerotopes) were statistically significant. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination was used to investigate differences in phytoplankton samples and their relationship with delta C-13 variation. When morphological and functional phytoplankton traits were superimposed, the NMS ordination showed that cylinder cells (for cell shape classes), class 500-2000 mu m(3) (for cell size classes) and Group 6 (for MBFG) were the most related to delta C-13 variation. Our study confirms that the variation in the pelagic VC seston most probably reflects changes in phytoplankton carbon isotopic signature, consequent to changes in availability of carbon sources depending on the season and due to different isotopic fractionation of phytoplankton taxonomic groups. Statistical investigations have allowed us to investigate the potential role of phytoplankton morphological and functional traits in the seasonal variation of delta C-13 and to suggest their importance in the interpretation of natural stable isotopes studies in lake ecosystems.

AB Despite the great interest in characterizing the functional structure and resilience of functional groups in natural communities, few studies have examined in which way the roles and relationships of coexisting species change during community succession, a fundamental and natural process that follows the release of new resources in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Variation in algal traits that characterize different phases and stages of community succession on rocky shores are likely to influence the magnitude, direction of effects, and the level of redundancy and complementarity in the diverse assemblage of herbivores. Two separate field experiments were conducted to quantify per capita and population effects and the functional relationship (i.e., redundancy or complementarity) of four herbivore species found in central Chile during early and late algal succession. The first experiment examined grazer effects on the colonization and establishment of early-succession algal species. The second experiment examined effects on the late-successional, dominant corticated alga Mazzaella laminarioides. Complementary laboratory experiments with all species and under natural environmental conditions allowed us to further characterize the collective effects of these species. We found that, during early community succession, all herbivore species had similar effects on the ephemeral algae, ulvoids, but only during the phase of colonization. Once these algae were established, only a subset of the species was able to control their abundance. During late succession, only the keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa could control corticated Mazzaella. The functional relationships among these species changed dramatically from redundant effects on ephemeral algae during early colonization, to a more complementary role on established early-successional algae, to a dominant (i.e., keystone) effect on late succession. This study highlights that functional relationship within consumer assemblages can vary at different phases and times of community succession. Differentiation in herbivore roles emphasizes the need to evaluate consumer's impacts through different times of community succession, and through experimental manipulations to make even broad predictions about the resilience or vulnerability of diverse intertidal assemblages to human disturbances.

AB The functional diversity index has shown that the functional diversity of the macrobenthic community increased along a spatial gradient of distance from the Po river delta (Emilia-Romagna coast, Italy, North-Adriatic Sea), which suggests that riverine inputs have a detrimental effect on community functioning. This study focuses on two different depths along a southward gradient of increasing distance from the Po river delta where the Po river is the main source of freshwater and nutrient inputs in the North-Adriatic Sea. A Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) was used to examine a dataset of 156 soft-bottom macrobenthic species that were collected at eight stations in this area. Instead of comparing communities on the basis of their taxonomic composition, BTA uses a series of life history, morphological and behavioural characteristics of species to indicate aspects of their ecological functioning. The variability of the Emilia-Romagna dataset was governed by relatively few biological traits: growth form, trophic group, type of movement, habit, adult mobility and bioturbation activity. The community closer to the coastline was mainly composed of moderately mobile vermiform organisms with burrowing or tube-dwelling behaviour, and deposit feeding behaviour. However, the offshore community was mainly characterized by organisms with a laterally compressed or globose body and tube-dwelling behaviour; filter feeders and deposit feeders were dominant.

AB Modular variation, whereby the relative degree of connectivity varies within a system, is thought to evolve through a process of selection that favors the integration of certain traits and the decoupling of others. In this way, modularity may facilitate the pace of evolution and determine evolvability. Alternatively, conserved patterns of modularity may act to constrain the rate and direction of evolution by preventing certain functions from evolving. A comprehensive understanding of the potential interplay between these phenomena will require knowledge of the inheritance and the genetic basis of modularity. Here we explore these ideas in the cichlid mandible by investigating patterns of modularity at the clade and species levels and through the introduction of a new approach, the individual level. Specifically, we assessed patterns of covariation in Lake Malawi cichlid species that employ alternate "biting" and "suction-feeding" modes of feeding and in a hybrid cross between these two ecotypes. Across the suction-feeding clade, patterns of modularity were largely conserved and reflected a functionally based pattern. In contrast, the biting species displayed a pattern of modularity that more closely matched developmental modules. The pattern of modularity present in our F2 population was very similar to the pattern exhibited by the biter, suggesting a role for dominant inheritance. We demonstrate that our individual-level metric of modularity (IMM) is a valid quantitative trait that has a nonlinear relationship with shape. IMMs for each model were used as quantitative characters to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) that underlie modularity. Our QTL analysis offers new insights into the genetic basis of modularity in these fishes that may eventually lead to the discovery of the genetic processes that delineate particular modules. In all, our findings suggest that modularity is both a constraining and an evolvable force in cichlid evolution, as distinct patterns occur between species and variation exists among individuals.

AB Research on suction-feeding performance has mostly focused on measuring individual underlying components such as suction pressure, flow velocity, ram or the effects of suction-induced forces on prey movement during feeding. Although this body of work has advanced our understanding of aquatic feeding, no consensus has yet emerged on how to combine all of these variables to predict prey-capture performance. Here, we treated the aquatic predator-prey encounter as a hydrodynamic interaction between a solid particle (representing the prey) and the unsteady suction flows around it, to integrate the effects of morphology, physiology, skull kinematics, ram and fluid mechanics on suction-feeding performance. We developed the suction-induced force-field (SIFF) model to study suction-feeding performance in 18 species of centrarchid fishes, and asked what morphological and functional traits underlie the evolution of feeding performance on three types of prey. Performance gradients obtained using SIFF revealed that different trait combinations contribute to the ability to feed on attached, evasive and (strain-sensitive) zooplanktonic prey because these prey types impose different challenges on the predator. The low overlap in the importance of different traits in determining performance also indicated that the evolution of suction-feeding ability along different ecological axes is largely unconstrained. SIFF also yielded estimates of feeding ability that performed better than kinematic traits in explaining natural patterns of prey use. When compared with principal components describing variation in the kinematics of suction-feeding events, SIFF output explained significantly more variation in centrarchid diets, suggesting that the inclusion of more mechanistic hydrodynamic models holds promise for gaining insight into the evolution of aquatic feeding performance.

AB Food webs in different ecosystems are often connected through spatial resource subsidies. As a result, biodiversity effects in one ecosystem may cascade to adjacent ecosystems. I tested the hypothesis that aquatic predator diversity effects cascade to terrestrial food webs by altering a prey subsidy (biomass and trophic structure of emerging aquatic insects) entering terrestrial food webs, in turn altering the distribution of a terrestrial consumer (spider) that feeds on emerging aquatic insects. Fish presence, but not diversity, altered the trophic structure of emerging aquatic insects by strongly reducing the biomass of emerging predators (dragonflies) relative to non-feeding taxa (chironomid midges). Fish diversity reduced emerging insect biomass through enhanced effects on the most common prey taxa: predatory dragonflies Pantala flavescens and non-feeding chironomids. Terrestrial spiders (Tetragnathidae) primarily captured emerging chironomids, which were reduced in the high richness (3 spp.) treatment relative to the 1 and 2 species treatments. As a result, terrestrial spider abundance was lower above pools with high fish richness (3 species) than pools with 1 and 2 species. Synergistic predation effects were mostly limited to the high richness treatment, in which fish occupied each level of vertical microhabitat in the water-column (benthic, middle, surface). This study demonstrates that predator diversity effects are not limited to the habitat of the predator, but can propagate to adjacent ecosystems, and demonstrates the utility of using simple predator functional traits (foraging domain) to more accurately predict the direction of predator diversity effects.

AB The recovery of macrofaunal communities after marine aggregate dredging was assessed using both traditional indices (abundance, biomass and species diversity), and functional analysis techniques (Somatic Production, Taxonomic Distinctness, Infaunal Trophic Index, Biological Traits Analysis and Rao's Quadratic Entropy). A previously dredged area (Area 222). located off the southeast coast of England was selected for this investigation. Area 222 was split into sites that had been subjected to relatively high dredging intensity, relatively low dredging intensity, and undisturbed reference areas. Both traditional and functional analyses indicated that macrofauna at the low dredging intensity site had fully recovered at least 7 years after the dredging ceased. Recovery times at the high intensity site had a greater variability and most of the techniques recorded the recovery had yet to take place even 11 years after the dredging had ceased. Since Area 222 was dredged for a long period of time (approx. 25 years), it is suggested that a longer time series of study be carried out so that the definitive recovery period in this high intensity site can be determined. While a longer time series study is not always a realistic or cost effective, the present study could be useful to facilitate the selection of metrics to support in the assessment of macrofaunal recovery.

AB We carried out an integrated analysis of ecosystem services in the Donana social-ecological system (southwestern Spain), from the providers (different aquatic plant functional groups) to the beneficiaries (different stakeholders living in or visiting the area). We explored the ecosystem services supplied by aquatic plants by linking these services to different plant functional traits, identifying relevant ecosystem services and then working our way backward to ecosystem properties and the functional traits underpinning them. We started from 15 ecosystem services associated with aquatic systems (freshwater marshes, salt marshes, ponds on aeolian sheets, temporal coastal ponds, and estuaries) and related them to plant traits (directly or indirectly through intermediate ecosystem properties). We gathered information from the literature on the functional traits of 144 plants occurring in the aquatic ecosystems of Donana. We analyzed the species x trait matrix with multivariate classification and ordination techniques and obtained seven functional groups with different potentials for delivering ecosystem services. A survey was then administered to 477 stakeholders to analyze, through the use of a contingent valuation exercise, how the ecosystem services provided by the different functional groups were valued. We identified connections between individual plant traits, ecosystem processes, and ecosystem services, but a mismatch appeared between the functional groups and the economic values placed on them by the beneficiaries. We found that contingent valuation applied to ecosystem services tended to ignore the ecosystem properties and biodiversity underpinning them. Our results cast doubts over the suitability of the economic valuation framework of ecosystem services to capture the full value of biodiversity and ecosystems to people.

AB The adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes in East Africa have been associated with the acquisition of evolutionary novelties as well as the ecological opportunities existing in the East African Great lakes. Two remarkable evolutionary innovations are the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, found in all cichlid species, and the anal fin egg-spots of mouthbrooding cichlids. Based on their conserved functions during the development of both the jaw apparatus and pigmentation, the endothelin ligands and receptors form a putative link between these naturally and sexually selected traits. Here we study the evolutionary history of four members of two endothelin pathways (Edn1/EdnrAa and Edn3b/EdnrB1a) to elucidate their possible roles during the evolution and development of key innovations in East African cichlids species. The analyses performed on partial sequences (ca. 6,000 bp per taxon) show that all four endothelin family members evolved under purifying selection, although both ligands are characterized by an accelerated rate of protein evolution in comparison to the receptors. In accordance with earlier findings, we show that the mature protein sequence of Edn1 and Edn3 are highly conserved, also in cichlids, whereas the preproendothelin parts are variable indicating relaxed selective constraints. In the receptors, nonsynonymous substitutions were mainly found in the ligand-binding domains suggesting functional divergence. Gene expression assays with Real-Time PCR indeed reveal that the two studied endothelin pathways are expressed in the cichlid pharyngeal jaw and in the haplochromine egg-spot (among other pigment-cell containing tissues), suggesting their involvement during morphogenesis of naturally and sexually selected traits in cichlids.

AB Terrestrial invertebrates have been reported to be positively selected by stream salmonids. We assessed the importance of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates to salmonid diets in 25 streams in Finland, with the hypothesis that terrestrial prey would be important in only the smallest forest streams. Several measures of prey availability were used, including proportional abundance in benthic or drift samples, compared with a trait-based approach, to predict diet composition. Across all 25 streams in autumn, blackfly and caddis larvae were the most important prey items. Terrestrial invertebrates were of moderate importance in all streams, including the smallest. Pure availability predicted diet best and provided, in most cases, a significant fit with the observed diet. In a quantitative literature review, the mean proportion of terrestrial prey in salmonid diets was 17%, being highest for the largest fish (>= 15 cm). Species of the genus Salmo consumed significantly less terrestrials than did other salmonid genera. The proportion of terrestrial prey was highest in streams flowing through deciduous forests, but it was only weakly correlated with channel width.

AB We quantified fish assemblages in 20 streams containing mill dams in various physical conditions (dams intact, partially breached, or relict with normal flows) in Alabama, USA, during the period from 2006 to 2008. We used a backpack electroshocker to sample three 150-m reaches per stream: 500 to 1000 m downstream of the dam, 0 to 100 m downstream of the dam, and 100 m upstream of the impoundment. Species- and trait-based analyses revealed slightly different, but often complementary, information about fish assemblages. Fish species richness and benthic conditions differed longitudinally among reaches in streams with dams. In streams with breached darns, species richness, but not trait richness, was lower in upstream reaches than in downstream reaches. Overall, species and trait richness were correlated with benthic-habitat variables in streams with relict darns and were significantly correlated with water physicochemical variables in streams with intact and breached dams. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination failed to resolve any discernable site groupings based on species abundance data, and indicator species analysis revealed 1 indicator species, Esox americanus, upstream of relict dams. Fourth-corner trait analysis revealed more trait associations in reaches in streams with breached dams than in those with intact or relict dams. Generalist spawners (nest-guarding polyphils) increased and taxa with a preference for cobble substrates decreased upstream of breached dams. Few longitudinal differences were observed in streams with relict and intact dams. Taken together, dams, particularly those that are breached, appear to exert a strong upstream influence on fish species richness and functional composition and could alter the trophic structure of the entire stream through habitat modifications or limitation of fish movements.

AB 1. Most of the world's rivers are affected by dams and weirs. Information on the quantitative and qualitative effects of weirs across biological communities is crucial for successful management and restoration of stream ecosystems. Yet, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that have analysed the serial discontinuity in direct proximity of weirs including diverse taxonomic groups from algae to fish.
   2. This study compared the abiotic stream habitat characteristics upstream and downstream of weirs as well as their effects on the community structure of periphyton, aquatic macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fish at five different study rivers.
   3. Physicochemical habitat characteristics discriminated strongly between upstream and downstream sides of weirs in terms of water depth, current speed, substratum composition and the transition between free-flowing water and interstitial zone. Accordingly, abundance, diversity, community structure and functional ecological traits of all major taxonomic groups were indicative of serial discontinuity, but the discriminative power of individual taxonomic groups strongly differed between rivers.
   4. The simultaneous inclusion of abiotic habitat variables, taxonomic diversity and biological traits in multivariate non-metric multidimensional scaling was most comprehensive and powerful for the quantification of weir effects. In some cases, the intrastream discrimination induced by weirs exceeded the variation between geographically distant rivers of different geological origin and drainage systems. Community effects were generally detectable on high levels of taxonomic resolution such as family or order level.
   5. Synthesis and applications. River sections in spatial proximity to weirs are affected seriously and should be included in the ecological assessments of the European Water Framework Directive. Multivariate models that include several taxonomic groups and physicochemical habitat variables provide a universally applicable tool for the ecological assessment of impacts on serial discontinuity and other stressors on stream ecosystem health.

AB Many factors contribute to the nonrandom processes of extinctions and invasions that are changing the structure of ecological communities worldwide. These factors include the attributes of the species, their abiotic environment, and the interactions and feedbacks between them. The relative importance of these factors has been difficult to quantify. We used nested subset theory and a novel permutation-based extension of gradient analysis to disentangle the direct and indirect pathways by which these factors affect the metacommunity structure of freshwater fishes inhabiting the streams tributary to the San Francisco Bay. Our analyses provide quantitative measures of how species and stream attributes may influence extinction vulnerability and invasion risk, highlight the need for considering the multiple interacting drivers of community change concurrently, and indicate that the ongoing disassembly and assembly of Bay Area freshwater fish communities are not fully symmetric processes. Fish communities are being taken apart and put back together in only partially analogous trajectories of extinction and invasion for which no single explanatory hypothesis is sufficient. Our study thereby contributes to the forecasting of continued community change and its effects on the functioning of freshwater ecosystems.

AB 1. Long-term data on the meteorology, hydrology, physicochemistry and plankton of a reservoir and its tributaries in SE Germany run from 1976 until now. This dimictic reservoir changed from mesotrophic to eutrophic in the 1970s, remained eutrophic in the 1980s and returned to the mesotrophic state after a sharp reduction in P loading in 1990.
   2. Phytoplankton biomass reaches an annual maximum in spring and consists almost entirely of diatoms. While Asterionella formosa was dominant until 1990, Aulacoseira subarctica became more frequent at the end of the 1990s and was particularly abundant in years with short winters.
   3. Statistical analyses suggested that these changes were triggered primarily by the mild winters that were frequent after 1988. Climate-related hydrophysical variables and the initial biomass of the diatoms at the beginning of the year, considered as an 'inoculum', were identified as most important. These variables explained 39% of the total variance of the relative abundance, whereas the change in trophic conditions was responsible for about 20%.
   4. The absolute and relative abundance of A. subarctica was positively related to short ice cover, early ice-out and a long-lasting spring circulation. Owing to its physiological traits, and particularly its ability to survive under low-light conditions, A. subarctica benefitted from short, mild winters. Under such conditions, it could sustain or establish a high initial biomass, whereas the concentrations of the other diatoms decreased over winter. However, this advantage may be lost if further warming causes an early onset of summer stratification. Because of its low population growth rate and requirement for high turbulence, A. subarctica needs long, cold springs to exploit the improved starting conditions and to become abundant.
   5. In contrast to A. subarctica, A. formosa required a substantial soluble reactive phosphorus supply to compete successfully. The eutrophic conditions until 1990 were the prerequisite for its mass growth under low-light and low-temperature conditions during the spring. After reduction in P concentration from 1990, A. formosa declined and other diatom species became more abundant.
   6. These other diatoms may be viewed as 'stopgaps' when conditions were not favourable for A. subarctica or A. formosa. Diatoma elongatum exploited brief circulation periods in years with low P loading. Synedra acus and Fragilaria crotonensis, because of their poor competitive ability at low light intensity, reached high density in the upper water column in the transitional period between spring circulation and summer stratification.
   7. Our study suggests that climate-related variables have crucial impacts on the spring phytoplankton dynamics of deep stratified waterbodies. They can mask the consequences of changes in the trophic conditions and, corresponding to the functional traits of the different phytoplankton species, also decisively control their relative abundances. In this reservoir, the warmer winters and prolonged spring circulations did not only lead to high phytoplankton biomass (despite considerably reduced nutrient loads) but also cause a marked shift in the diatom assemblage during the spring bloom.

AB High quality monitoring data are vital for tracking and understanding the causes of ecosystem change. We present a potentially powerful approach for phytoplankton and aquatic ecosystem monitoring, based on integration of scanning flow-cytometry for the characterization and counting of algal cells with multiparametric vertical water profiling. This approach affords high-frequency data on phytoplankton abundance, functional traits and diversity, coupled with the characterization of environmental conditions for growth over the vertical structure of a deep water body. Data from a pilot study revealed effects of an environmental disturbance event on the phytoplankton community in Lake Lugano (Switzerland), characterized by a reduction in cytometry-based functional diversity and by a period of cyanobacterial dominance. These changes were missed by traditional limnological methods, employed in parallel to high-frequency monitoring. Modeling of phytoplankton functional diversity revealed the importance of integrated spatiotemporal data, including circadian time-lags and variability over the water column, to understand the drivers of diversity and dynamic processes. The approach described represents progress toward an automated and trait-based analysis of phytoplankton natural communities. Streamlining of high-frequency measurements may represent a resource for understanding, modeling and managing aquatic ecosystems under impact of environmental change, yielding insight into processes governing phytoplankton community resistance and resilience.

AB Neglecting the naturally existing functional diversity of communities and the resulting potential to respond to altered conditions may strongly reduce the realism and predictive power of ecological models. We therefore propose and study a predator-prey model that describes mutual feedback via species shifts in both predator and prey, using a dynamic trait approach. Species compositions of the two trophic levels were described by mean functional traits-prey edibility and predator food-selectivity- and functional diversities by the variances. Altered edibility triggered shifts in food-selectivity so that consumers continuously respond to the present prey composition, and vice versa. This trait-mediated feedback mechanism resulted in a complex dynamic behavior with ongoing oscillations in the mean trait values, reflecting continuous reorganization of the trophic levels. The feedback was only possible if sufficient functional diversity was present in both trophic levels. Functional diversity was internally maintained on the prey level as no niche existed in our system, which was ideal under any composition of the predator level due to the trade-offs between edibility, growth and carrying capacity. The predators were only subject to one trade-off between food-selectivity and grazing ability and in the absence of immigration, one predator type became abundant, i.e., functional diversity declined to zero. In the lack of functional diversity the system showed the same dynamics as conventional models of predator-prey interactions ignoring the potential for shifts in species composition. This way, our study identified the crucial role of trade-offs and their shape in physiological and ecological traits for preserving diversity.

AB Species are often grouped according to their biological or functional traits to better understand their contribution to ecosystem functioning. However, it is becoming clear that a single species can perform different roles in different habitats. Austrohelice crassa, a burrow-building mud crab shifts its primary bioturbational role to that of a vertical mixer in non-cohesive sediments as frequent burrow collapse greatly enhances sediment reworking. We conducted in situ crab density manipulations in two sediment environments (a non-cohesive sand and a cohesive muddy-sand) to examine if the context-specific functional roles were linked to changes in solute fluxes across the sediment-water interface. Across both habitats, we show that A. crassa regulated nutrient cycling, creating strong density driven effects on solute exchanges. Increasing crab density increased sediment O-2 demand and the flux of NH4+ from the sediment, indicating much of the response was physiologically driven. Clear interactions between A. crassa and microphytobenthos were also detected in both habitats. Despite lowering microphyte standing stock through deposit feeding, A. crassa increased benthic primary production per unit of chlorophyll a. Our experiment also revealed important context-specific differences, most notably for NH4+ fluxes, which were higher where burrows and their associated microbial communities were most stable (muddy-sand). This study highlights the need to integrate interactions between organism behavior and habitat type into functional group studies to broaden conceptual frameworks and avoid oversimplification of highly complex organism-sediment interactions.

AB The utility of traits involved in resource exploitation is a central criterion for the adaptive character of radiations. Here, we test for differentiation in morphology, jaw mechanics and nutrition among species and sexes of Lake Matanos sympatric roundfin sailfin silversides. The three incipient fish species differ significant in several candidate traits for adaptation following ecological selection pressure, corresponding to contrasting jaw mechanics and distinct patterns in food resource use. These findings are consistent with functional adaptation and suggest divergence following alternative modes of feeding specialization. Further, intersexual resource partitioning and corresponding adaptation in jaw mechanics is evident in two of the three incipient species, demonstrating that sexual dimorphism contributes to the ecomorphological and trophic diversity of the emerging radiation. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study reporting interspecific as well as intersexual adaptation by alternative modes of form and function in an evolving fish species flock.

AB Trade-offs among functional traits are essential for explaining community structure and species coexistence. While two-way trade-offs have been investigated in many systems, higher-dimensional trade-offs remain largely hypothetical. Here we demonstrate a three-way trade-off between cell size and competitive abilities for nitrogen and phosphorus in marine and freshwater phytoplankton. At a given cell size, competitive abilities for N and P are negatively correlated, but as cell size increases, competitive ability decreases for both nutrients. The relative importance of the two trade-off axes appears to be environment dependent, suggesting different selective pressures: freshwater phytoplankton separate more along the N vs. P competition axis, and marine phytoplankton separate more along the nutrient competition vs. cell size axis. Our results demonstrate the multidimensional nature of key trade-offs among traits and suggest that such trade-offs may drive species interactions and structure ecological communities.

AB Identification of tradeoffs among physiological and morphological traits and their use in cost-benefit models and ecological or evolutionary optimization arguments have been hallmarks of ecological analysis for at least 50 years. Carnivorous plants are model systems for studying a wide range of ecophysiological and ecological processes and the application of a cost-benefit model for the evolution of carnivory by plants has provided many novel insights into trait-based cost-benefit models. Central to the cost-benefit model for the evolution of botanical carnivory is the relationship between nutrients and photosynthesis; of primary interest is how carnivorous plants efficiently obtain scarce nutrients that are supplied primarily in organic form as prey, digest and mineralize them so that they can be readily used, and allocate them to immediate versus future needs. Most carnivorous plants are terrestrial-they are rooted in sandy or peaty wetland soils-and most studies of cost-benefit tradeoffs in carnivorous plants are based on terrestrial carnivorous plants. However approximately 10% of carnivorous plants are unrooted aquatic plants. Here we ask whether the cost-benefit model applies equally well to aquatic carnivorous plants and what general insights into tradeoff models are gained by this comparison. Nutrient limitation is more pronounced in terrestrial carnivorous plants, which also have much lower growth rates and much higher ratios of dark respiration to photosynthetic rates than aquatic carnivorous plants. Phylogenetic constraints on ecophysiological tradeoffs among carnivorous plants remain unexplored. Despite differences in detail, the general cost-benefit framework continues to be of great utility in understanding the evolutionary ecology of carnivorous plants. We provide a research agenda that if implemented would further our understanding of ecophysiological tradeoffs in carnivorous plants and also would provide broader insights into similarities and differences between aquatic and terrestrial plants of all types.

AB 1. Reinstating more natural water regimes is often a priority intervention to rehabilitate wetlands that have been degraded through anthropogenic changes to their natural wetting and drying cycles. Hydrological interventions are often made in chronically desiccated wetlands but less commonly in wetlands that have been permanently inundated and that require a drawdown phase for rehabilitation. Reports on the effectiveness of reinstating a drawdown phase in chronically inundated wetlands are particularly rare.
   2. We undertook a landscape-scale, experimental drawdown of water levels at Dowd Morass, a large, Ramsar-listed, brackish-water wetland in south-eastern Australia that had been artificially flooded for 30+ years. During the hydrological manipulation, c. 500 ha of the wetland was drawn down and re-flooded, and the remaining c. 1000 ha was used as a control site. Fringing areas with a fluctuating water regime were used as a reference site. Results were analysed in terms of gradient analysis, by classifying the different water regimes created by the hydrological interventions. The response of wetland vegetation was measured along replicated transects over a 4-year period, before, during and after drawdown. Wetland plants were assigned to plant functional groups for analysis. Assembly theory and knowledge of life-history traits were used to predict that drawdown would promote recruitment of plant species that required exposed sediment for germination and seedling establishment.
   3. Within-wetland microtopography interacted with the hydrological interventions to generate three distinct water regimes, which were differentiated by the spatial extent of exposed sediment and duration of the dry period. Drawdown promoted limited recruitment of some plant species, and the survival of cohorts then depended strongly on the extent and duration of the dry period. Species richness and vegetation cover (understorey and overstorey) continued to decline in constantly flooded areas of the wetland. Increased salinisation of sediments and surface waters reduced the effectiveness of the drawdown and dramatically affected species richness and cover of aquatic vegetation, which did not recover fully when fresher conditions returned.
   4. The capacity of vegetation to respond to the reinstatement of a drawdown cycle following chronic inundation was constrained by abiotic (e. g. salinity) and biotic (e. g. depauperate seedbanks) factors. Reinstating a dry phase in chronically inundated, brackish-water wetlands is complex and risky and may not effectively improve vegetation condition in the short term. In the case of Dowd Morass, rehabilitation was most successful in sites that had been shallowly flooded prior to drawdown and that remained dry for longest.

AB The ability to develop reversible dermal extensions on the lower jaw in some South American characiform fishes has been proposed as a way to optimize the performance of aquatic surface respiration (ASR) during hypoxic conditions. These structures are formed by edema of the hypodermal tissues and can develop in a large proportion of individuals inhabiting a lake within a few hours following daily changes in dissolved oxygen. Our study report the development of dermal lip protuberances in eleven species of characiform fishes associated with periods of strong environmental hypoxia in floodplain lakes of Salado River, Argentina. Protuberances occurred in different basic forms in fishes with divergent head morphology (genera Astyanax, Ctenobrycon, Aphyocharax, Brycon, Mylossoma, Triportheus, Oligosarcus and Acestrorhynchus). The discovery of dermal projections on the anterior border of maxillary bone extends the known range of structures affected by lip protuberances. Dermal structures began to develop simultaneously in both jaws below dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations of 1.20-1.75 mgl(-1) and rose in a steep manner as oxygen level decreased. The degree of morphological plasticity differed among traits and species. The shape of response of morphology to DO was similar to that previously reported on ASR, providing additional evidence about the functional link between these traits. Our results suggests that dermal lip protuberances are widely spread among characiform fishes, affecting several mouth structures. The different types of protuberances would make up for the limitations imposed by body size and mouth shape and position on the performance of ASR in fishes with divergent morphology.

AB The European Water Framework Directive clearly indicates that fish is one of the "quality elements" to be considered for the assessment of lentic systems. However, few fish-based indices (FBIs) of biotic integrity have been developed for lakes so far.
   Hence, the aim of our study was to develop such a tool for French lakes. Fish surveys, lakes natural environmental parameters, catchment-scale anthropogenic pressures, and local pressures were collected for 67 reservoirs and 24 natural lakes throughout France. After assigning fish species into trophic, reproductive, and tolerance guilds, we derived a set of metrics reflecting complementary aspects of community functioning and condition. Other community-level traits such as richness and evenness were added. These metrics were modeled vs. natural environmental variables and pressures. Reference conditions at each site were then assessed using hindcasting modeling. Separate indices were eventually obtained for natural and artificial lakes by combining selected metrics. Fifteen out of 73 candidate fish metrics, covering all three groups of functional traits, displayed a significant response to anthropogenic pressures. After removal of the redundant traits, the final indices for natural lakes and reservoirs included three and six metrics, respectively. Agricultural-related impacts were prominent for reservoirs, whereas for natural lakes urban and local pressures displayed the most significant effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hagfishes (Myxinidae), a family of jawless marine pre-vertebrates, hold a unique evolutionary position, sharing a joint ancestor with the entire vertebrate lineage. They are thought to fulfil primarily the ecological niche of scavengers in the deep ocean. However, we present new footage from baited video cameras that captured images of hagfishes actively preying on other fish. Video images also revealed that hagfishes are able to choke their would-be predators with gill-clogging slime. This is the first time that predatory behaviour has been witnessed in this family, and also demonstrates the instantaneous effectiveness of hagfish slime to deter fish predators. These observations suggest that the functional adaptations and ecological role of hagfishes, past and present, might be far more diverse than previously assumed. We propose that the enduring success of this oldest extant family of fishes over 300 million years could largely be due to their unique combination of functional traits.

AB Biomass of dominant and companion species in plant functional groups may reflect associations among plant functional groups and species replacement along environmental (elevation) gradients in the typical area of Yi-Luo River. Using community ecology techniques, these researchers examined the influences of elevation factors on plant functional group dynamics and population interactions along elevation gradients in the drainage area of Yi-Luo River. Leaf/stem/fruit/total biomass of dominant and companion species in plant functional groups were calculated and the correlation between elevation and species biomass was analyzed. We showed that elevation was the most important environmental factor affecting the distribution pattern of biomass of plant functional groups composition. Total leaf and stem and fruit biomasses of dominant and companion 19 perennial herbaceous species in plant functional groups were significantly correlated with elevation gradient (P<0.05, P<0.01). Understanding the changes and their causes in these PFG is essential for further research of local ecosystem functions and the goal of sustainable development in the context of biodiversity conservation.

AB DNA barcoding has unraveled issues. related to cryptic species complexes, assigning life history stages of unidentified organisms and also towards better understanding of evolutionary relationships between organismal groups. Given the advantages of DNA barcoding, one can strongly argue that barcodes may prove to be extremely useful for marine meiobenthic studies particularly for taxonomic groups such as free-living marine nematodes and polychaetes from the Indian subcontinent. An integrative taxonomic approach based on morphological traits based taxonomy and DNA barcoding would be ideal for studying the meiobenthic groups from Indian sedimentary environments.

AB Climate change and associated glacial recession create new stream habitat that leads to the assembly of new riverine communities through primary succession. However, there are still very few studies of the patterns and processes of community assembly during primary succession for stream ecosystems. We illustrate the rapidity with which biotic communities can colonize and establish in recently formed streams by examining Stonefly Creek in Glacier Bay, Alaska (USA), which began to emerge from a remnant glacial ice mass between 1976 and 1979. By 2002, 57 macroinvertebrate and 27 microcrustacea species had become established. Within 10 years of the stream's formation, pink salmon and Dolly Varden charr colonized, followed by other fish species, including juvenile red and silver salmon, Coast Range sculpin, and sticklebacks. Stable-isotope analyses indicate that marine-derived nitrogen from the decay of salmon carcasses was substantially assimilated within the aquatic food web by 2004. The findings from Stonefly Creek are compared with those from a long-term study of a similarly formed but older stream (12 km to the northeast) to examine possible similarities in macroinvertebrate community and biological trait composition between streams at similar stages of development. Macroinvertebrate community assembly appears to have been initially strongly deterministic owing to low water temperature associated with remnant ice masses. In contrast, microcrustacean community assembly appears to have been more stochastic. However;as stream age and water temperature increased, macroinvertebrate colonization was also more stochastic, and taxonomic similarity between Stonefly Creek and a stream at the same stage of development was <50%. However the most abundant taxa were similar, and functional diversity of the two communities was almost identical. Tolerance is suggested as the major mechanism of community assembly. The rapidity with which salmonids and invertebrate communities have become established across an entire watershed has implications for the conservation of biodiversity in freshwater habitats.

AB The transition from marine to freshwater life in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is accompanied by complex morphological changes-including reduction in bony armor and change in body shape-but experimental evidence for the selective agents behind these evolutionary transitions is sparse. We investigated whether selection by predatory fish affects threespine stickleback morphology differentially when refuge is absent (pelagic lifestyle-ancestral condition) or present (benthic lifestyle-derived condition). Our results show that selection favors low numbers of lateral plates in habitats with refuge, whereas fully plated individuals have a selective advantage in habitats without refuge. We also found that a decrease in the length of the caudal peduncle increased survival probability, irrespective of habitat. The effect of spine lengths on survival was evident only in a multivariate analysis of selection, implying that it is essential to account for phenotypic and genetic correlations between traits before drawing conclusions about the effects of selection on single traits. Apart from uncovering targets and patterns of predator-induced selection on threespine stickleback morphology, our results provide direct evidence to support the hypothesis that differences in antipredator strategies in pelagic versus benthic sticklebacks could play a role in the repeated, independent cases of plate number reduction following freshwater colonization in this species.

AB 1. Our understanding of the contribution of interspecific interactions to functional diversity in nature lags behind our knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns. Although two-species mutualisms are found in all types of ecosystems, the study of their ecological influences on other community members has mostly been limited to third species, while their influence on entire communities remains largely unexplored.
   2. We hypothesized that mutualistic interactions between two respective ant species and an epiphyte mediate the biological traits composition of entire invertebrate communities that use the same host plant, thereby affecting food webs and functional diversity at the community level.
   3. Aechmea mertensii (Bromeliaceae) is both a phytotelm ('plant-held water') and an ant-garden epiphyte. We sampled 111 bromeliads (111 aquatic invertebrate communities) associated with either the ant Pachycondyla goeldii or Camponotus femoratus. The relationships between ants, bromeliads and invertebrate abundance data were examined using a redundancy analysis. Biological traits information for invertebrates was structured using a fuzzy-coding technique, and a co-inertia analysis between traits and abundance data was used to interpret functional differences in bromeliad ecosystems.
   4. The vegetative traits of A. mertensii depended on seed dispersion by C. femoratus and P. goeldii along a gradient of local conditions. The ant partner selected sets of invertebrates with traits that were best adapted to the bromeliads' morphology, and so the composition of the biological traits of invertebrate phytotelm communities depends on the identity of the ant partner. Biological traits suggest a bottom-up control of community structure in C. femoratus-associated phytotelmata and a greater structuring role for predatory invertebrates in P. goeldii-associated plants.
   5. This study presents new information showing that two-species mutualisms affect the functional diversity of a much wider range of organisms. Most biological systems form complex networks where nodes (e. g. species) are more or less closely linked to each other, either directly or indirectly, through intermediate nodes. Our observations provide community-level information about biological interactions and functional diversity, and perspectives for further observations intended to examine whether large-scale changes in interacting species/community structure over broad geographical and anthropogenic gradients affect ecosystem functions.

AB Asymptomatic Salmonella-carrier pigs present a major problem in preharvest food safety, with a recent survey indicating >50% of swine herds in the United States have Salmonella-positive animals. Salmonella-carrier pigs serve as a reservoir for contamination of neighbouring pigs, abattoir pens and pork products. In addition, fresh produce as well as water can be contaminated with Salmonella from manure used as fertilizer. Control of Salmonella at the farm level could be through genetic improvement of porcine disease resistance, a potentially powerful method of addressing preharvest pork safety. In this research, we integrate gene expression profiling data and sequence alignment-based prediction of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to successfully identify SNPs in functional candidate genes to test for the associations with swine response to Salmonella. A list of 2527 genes that were differentially regulated in porcine whole blood in response to infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were selected. In those genes, SNPs were predicted using ANEXdb alignments based on stringent clustering of all publically available porcine cDNA and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences. A set of 30 mostly non-synonymous SNPs were selected for genotype analysis of four independent populations (n = 750) with Salmonella faecal shedding or tissue colonization phenotypes. Nine SNPs segregated with minor allele frequency >= 15% in at least two populations. Statistical analysis revealed SNPs associated with Salmonella shedding, such as haptoglobin (HP, p = 0.001, q = 0.01), neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 (NCF2 #2, p = 0.04, q = 0.21) and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (p = 0.066, q = 0.21). These associations may be useful in identifying and selecting pigs with improved resistance to this bacterium.

AB This paper quantifies the impacts of two invasive species, Rapana venosa (Gastropoda, Muricidae) and Corbicula fluminea (Bivalvia, Corbiculidae), in the food web of the Rio de la Plata estuary and adjacent nearshore oceanic ecosystem. We analyzed certain functional traits of these mollusks assessed by a mass balance trophic model previously constructed for the years 2005-2007. This model incorporates 37 functional groups: three marine mammals species, one coastal bird, 17 fishes, 12 invertebrates, two zooplankton, one phytoplankton, and detritus. The model also includes 5 fishing fleets operating in the area. The results showed that the two invasive species affect multiple ecosystem components both directly and indirectly. R. venosa and the whitemouth croaker, Micropogonias furnieri, exhibited a high level of niche overlap (91%), while C. fluminea exhibited a high level of niche overlap with Mytilidae (94%), which suggests in both cases high levels of competition for similar resources. R. venosa had mixed trophic impacts but exhibited a predominantly top down effect on most bivalves. R. venosa could be a threat to natural resources in the area including to the fishing fleets. C. fluminea negatively influenced phytoplankton and detritus biomass and its positive effects on higher trophic level groups suggest a central bottom-up role in the food web as a bentho-pelagic coupler. Both species had negative impacts on the five fleets modeled, showing that the effects of these invasive species could extend to the socio-economic sector.

AB Endemic New Zealand frogs of the genus Leiopelma are from a basal lineage of extant anurans that release defensive secretions onto their skin when disturbed. Here, we characterize the gross anatomy and microscopic structure of the skin of L. archeyi, L. hochstetteri, and L. pakeka using stereoscopic, light and transmission electron microscopy. The terrestrial L. archeyi and L. pakeka possess dimorphic granular glands, categorized as type I and II, based on their frequency and morphological traits, whereas the semi-aquatic L. hochstetteri lacks type I glands. This is the first report of differential dimorphism in anurans of the same genus. This dimorphism could be interpreted as an adaptation to different physiological or ecological needs of these species. However, species within this ancient genus share similar general gland morphology with other anurans, namely, a secretory unit containing storage granules ensheathed by myoepithelial cells. Type I glands are ellipsoid, large and contain a homogeneous mass of electron-dense granules (1.8 +/- 0.08 mu m in diameter). Type II glands are round and contain larger heterogeneous granules (4.06 +/- 0.16 mu m) of varying densities. Exposure to noradrenaline causes the contraction of myoepithelial cells, resulting in bulk discharge of type I glands through the epidermal duct onto the skin surface. Differential release of secretions from dimorphic glands may be indicative of their functional specialisation in antipredatory or regulative roles. Mass spectrometric techniques were used to de novo sequence peptides present in the skin secretions of Leiopelma species. A total of 30 previously undescribed peptides from Leiopelma species were fully or partially sequenced. These peptides exhibited no similarity to any known compounds. J.

AB Aims
   Salt stress resulting from soil salinization is one of the driving forces of the land degradation throughout the world. The modern Yellow River delta is one of the most saline areas in China. Phytoremediation can be an effective way to restore the salinized ecosystems, which requires selecting appropriate plant species. This study explored the germination responses of common plant species from contrasting habitats in the Yellow River delta to varying salinity, offering experimental information for ecosystem restoration in the Yellow River delta.
   Methods
   In this study, 15 common plant species from the Yellow River delta were divided into two groups (high-salinity and low-salinity groups) by their natural habitats using Canonical Correlation Analysis. Seeds of each species were treated with five salinity levels (0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 ppt), using a randomized complete block design, and germinated seeds were counted and removed daily for 28 days to calculate the final germination proportion and mean time to germination. The germination responses of seeds to salinity treatments were compared between the two groups.
   Important Findings
   In relation to salinity, seed germination behavior of the test species was closely related to the salinity level of the habitats over which they were distributed. Species from the habitats with higher salinity had generally higher final germination proportion but shorter mean time to germination than those from the habitats with lower salinity in all of five salinity treatments used. The final germination proportion and mean time to germination of low-salinity group species were more sensitive to salinity than those of high-salinity group species. Selecting the species with high final germination proportion and short mean time to germination is important for restoration of salinized land.

AB The spatial structure of contact zones is often described as disjunct, diffuse or mosaic and presumed to be related to underlying ecological gradients. However, the ecology of contact zones, how they are structured, and if that structure is predictable based on the strength and nature of ecological gradients is unknown. Large spatial scales and the unreplicated nature of many of the best studied contact zones has made it difficult to codify broader ecological patterns. Freshwater stream fish contact zones have the advantage of being potentially replicated with well defined boundaries and predictable linear gradients (river continuum concept). We sampled four replicate topminnow (Fundulus olivaceus and F. notatus) contact zones in Gulf of Mexico drainages. In each, we quantified contact zone spatial structure and the strength of ecological gradients (habitat, physicochemical variables and fish community functional traits). All three types of contact zone structure were represented. Systems with weaker gradients had diffuse contact zones, low species richness and were numerically dominated by generalist species. Rates of hybridization were also variable among systems. There was no hybridization detected in the mosaic zone while hybrids were found at most of the co-occurrence sites in the diffuse and disjunct zones. Overall, local ecology clearly influences contact zone structure and the two species interact in fundamentally different ways in these four systems.

AB Benthic communities show changes in composition and structure across different environmental characteristics and habitats. However, incorporating species biological traits into the analysis can provide a better understanding of system functioning within habitats. We compare the functional diversity of macrobenthic communities from a contrasting shallow (15 m) and deep (50 m) sublittoral soft-sediment habitats in northern Chile, using biological traits analysis. Our aim was to highlight the biological characteristics responsible for differences between habitats and the implications for ecosystem functioning. Trait analysis showed that the deep habitat was restricted in providing functionally important biogenic structure and bioturbation and supports less diverse feeding-related energy pathways. The shallow habitat is characterized by more diverse energy pathways and a higher potential for matter exchange through bioturbation. We provide support to the predictions of transfer of energy from the benthos to upper trophic levels in the shallow, which is characterized mainly by normoxia and little organic matter content in the sediment. In the deep habitat, characterized by hypoxia and more organic matter, energy appears to be transferred to microbial components. We suggest that trait analysis should be added to the traditional approaches based on species diversity, because it provides indicators of ecosystem stress.

AB Climate change exerts direct effects on ecosystems but has additional indirect effects due to changes in agricultural practice. These include the increased use of pesticides, changes in the areas that are cultivated, and changes in the crops cultivated. It is well known that pesticides, and in particular insecticides, affect aquatic ecosystems adversely. To implement effective mitigation measures it is necessary to identify areas that are affected currently and those that will be affected in the future. As a consequence, we predicted potential exposure to insecticide (insecticide runoff potential, RP) under current conditions (1990) and under a model scenario of future climate and land use (2090) using a spatially explicit model on a continental scale, with a focus on Europe. Space-for-time substitution was used to predict future levels of insecticide application, intensity of agricultural land use, and cultivated crops. To assess the indirect effects of climate change, evaluation of the risk of insecticide exposure was based on a trait-based, climate-insensitive indicator system (SPEAR, SPEcies At Risk). To this end, RP and landscape characteristics that are relevant for the recovery of affected populations were combined to estimate the ecological risk (ER) of insecticides for freshwater communities. We predicted a strong increase in the application of, and aquatic exposure to, insecticides under the future scenario, especially in Central and Northern Europe. This, in turn, will result in a severe increase in ER in these regions. Hence, the proportion of stream sites adjacent to arable land that do not meet the requirements for good ecological status as defined by the EU Water Framework Directive will increase (from 33% to 39% for the EU-25 countries), in particular in the Scandinavian and Baltic countries (from 6% to 19%). Such spatially explicit mapping of risk enables the planning of adaptation and mitigation strategies including vegetated buffer strips and nonagricultural recolonization zones along streams.

AB The expression of phenotypically plastic traits in prey organisms, triggered by changes in the abundance of their predators, is customarily assumed to involve costs in some fitness components such as fecundity, growth or survival. However, these plastic responses may also have an interaction cost, which is assessed by the strength of interspecific interactions such as increased vulnerability to other predators or a reduction in competitive ability. This study assesses experimentally the effects of induced morphological defenses triggered by the carnivorous rotifer Asplanchna brightwelli, on the competitive ability of two herbivorous populations, and the reciprocal dominance between the rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus and Brachionus havanaensis. Our results support the existence of a trade-off between the expression of induced morphological defenses and competitive ability in aquatic animals. Specifically, we show that: (i) a consumer which reduces its vulnerability to predation via induced defenses increases its resource requirement to maintain zero population growth; and (ii) the expression of induced defenses promotes a qualitative shift in the relative competitive performance of the two herbivores over a single resource gradient. These results reinforce the general idea of functional community consequences of phenotypic plasticity, in particular the expression of inducible defenses of prey.

AB Quantitative biological assessment protocols are needed for monitoring river status and evaluating river rehabilitation efforts. We conducted a standardized macroinvertebrate survey at 100 sites on 38 nonwadeable rivers in Wisconsin to construct, test, and apply an index of biotic integrity (IBI) intended to be such a bioassessment tool. We assigned independent samples to IBI development (n = 75) and IBI validation (n = 25) data sets. We placed Hester-Dendy artificial substrates at the sites for 6 wk and processed the samples of colonizing macroinvertebrates in the laboratory with a 500-target subsampling procedure plus a large-rare taxon search. Independent of the biota, we assigned an environmental disturbance score to each site based upon water chemistry, land cover, flow modification, and point-source pollution. Ten metrics that represent macroinvertebrate assemblage structure, composition, and function constitute the IBI: the number of taxa in: 1) Insecta or 2) Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT); % individuals that were: 3) Insecta, 4) intolerant EPT, 5) tolerant chironomids, 6) gatherers, 7) scrapers, or from 8) the dominant 3 taxa; 9) the mean pollution tolerance value; and 10) the number of unique ecological functional trait niches. Analyses on both the validation subset of sites and all sites inclusive confirmed that least-disturbed sites had the highest IBI scores, severely disturbed sites had the lowest scores, and moderately disturbed sites had intermediate scores. Chironominae and Hydropsychidae taxa known to tolerate nutrient enrichment and overall degraded conditions dominated samples with low IBI scores. In contrast, a diverse assemblage that thrives in relatively undisturbed conditions was present in samples with high IBI scores. Comparison of the new macroinvertebrate IBI with an existing fish IBI suggested that the indices respond to different environmental stressors and illustrated the limitations of using only one taxonomic group for bioassessment. We discuss new macroinvertebrate methods, an IBI development process, and the refinement of metrics that may be useful in tailoring assessment tools for large rivers or wadeable streams in other regions. We also present applications of the IBI, including its potential use in comprehensive large river monitoring programs and for evaluating management efforts.

AB Benthic invertebrates have important ecosystem engineering functions (bioturbation and biodeposition) in freshwater and marine benthic systems. Bioturbation and biodeposition affect the metabolism of the water-sediment interface through modification of water-sediment fluxes or organic-matter enrichment of sediments by biodeposits. The functional significance of these processes depends strongly on the type of invertebrate activities (the functional traits of the invertebrates) and on the modulation of this activity by environmental conditions. The aim of my article is to propose a common framework for the role of bioturbation/biodeposition in benthic habitats of both marine and freshwater environments. In these ecosystems, hydrological exchanges between the water and sediments (interstitial flow rates) control the microbial activity inside sediments. The ability of ecosystem engineers to influence benthic microbial processes differs strongly between diffusion-dominated (low interstitial flow rates) and advection-dominated (high interstitial flow rates) habitats. Bioturbation/biodeposition may play a role in diffusion-dominated habitats where invertebrates can significantly modify water and particle fluxes at the water-sediment interface, whereas a slight influence of ecosystem engineers is expected in advection-dominated habitats where fluxes are predominantly controlled by hydrological processes. A future challenge will be to test this general framework in marine and freshwater habitats by quantifying the interactions between the functional traits of species and the water-sediment exchanges.

AB A range of biodiversity metrics are available to assess the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. However, performance varies considerably among different types of metrics and provides different information regarding ecosystem conditions, thus making difficult the selection of appropriate metrics for biomonitoring. The present study evaluated the robustness of six biodiversity metrics to assess environmental change and determine their utility as relevant indicators of ecosystem biodiversity and functionality. Traditional metrics such as species richness and Shannon diversity were considered along with alternative metrics such as functional diversity, size diversity and taxonomic distinctness. To that end, invertebrate assemblages in a river floodplain were used as a case study to evaluate the performance of metrics using Generalized Additive Models (GAM). GAM explained between eight and 49% of the variability in biodiversity. The regression models exhibited differences in the response of biodiversity indicators to environmental factors, suggesting that intermediate levels of turbidity and low salinity are conditions favouring increased biodiversity in the study area. Based on correlations among metrics and responses to primary environmental factors, it is concluded that Shannon and functional diversity, and rarefied species richness generated similar information regarding ecosystem conditions (i.e., the metrics were redundant): while size diversity and distinctness provided useful additional data characterizing ecosystem quality (i.e., the metrics were complementary). Functional diversity indicated riot only number and dominance of species, but also each species functional role in the community, and was therefore the most informative biodiversity metric. Nevertheless, the use of a combination of metrics, for example functional and size diversity, and variation in taxonomic distinctness, provides complementary data that will serve to achieve a more thorough understanding of ecosystem structure and function, and response to primary environmental influences.

AB During the last decade multimetric indices (MMIs) have been greatly improved by the use of appropriate criteria to define reference conditions and by the use of statistical analysis to select a consistent set of metrics. Among the large number of MMIs developed to assess the ecological status of streams based on fish communities, the emphasis was mainly put on warmwater assemblages. When compared with warmwater fish assemblages, coldwater assemblages present depauperate faunas with a limited suit of traits. Thus, very often the number of metrics used to compute MMIs for coldwater streams is lower than for warmwaters. The objective of this study was to develop new metrics specific to European coldwater assemblages that integrate both the species traits and the body size of fish. Indeed, whereas the use of size or age classes has been highly advocated for developing MMIs, it remains largely underrepresented. Therefore, we used eight biological and ecological traits to characterize species and two size classes: small and large individuals. Among the 96 metrics tested, four were successfully related to environmental gradients and three displayed a significant response to anthropogenic pressures: the number of small rheophilous individuals, the number of small oxygen-intolerant individuals, and the number of small-habitat-intolerant individuals. These results demonstrate that metrics based on size classes could be used in the development of MMIs for coldwater streams and more generally for low-species rivers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was describe functional faunal assemblages occurring in streams with high influence of urbanization in USA and Brazil to answer the question whether similar biological traits of fish assemblages would be found between streams with high influence of urbanization in USA and Brazil. We compiled data on the structure and composition of freshwater fishes in 46 urban streams in the USA and 10 urban streams in Brazil. Data on functional traits was established in accordance with ordinal data on abundance. Cluster analysis was conducted to examine relationships among species composition across all sites sampled and to uncover patterns in functional traits of the fish assemblages by nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS). The cluster analysis separated the biogeographic regions in relation to the fish fauna composition. However, the ordination analysis (NMS) did not reveal differences between functional traits in Brazil and USA urban fish assemblages, suggesting functional similarity of very disparate zoogeographic assemblages.

AB The genetic and functional diversity of Bacillus and Bacillus-derived genera was analyzed in soil samples collected from three different fields near Century Paper Mill, Lal Kuan, Uttarakhand, India. Two had been subjected to concentrated and diluted effluent irrigation for the past 25 years and were designated as a concentrated effluent irrigated field (CEIF) and a dilute effluent irrigated field (DEIF), respectively. The field irrigated with fresh water was designated as a water irrigated field (WIF). Increase in pH, Na and Zn content and decrease in Fe content was observed due to effluent irrigation. The population count of Bacillus and Bacillus-derived was maximum in DEIF followed by WIF and CEIF Variations in plant growth-promoting traits and extracellular enzymes were observed among the isolates from the three different field soils. Based on the amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) with three restriction enzymes, all the selected 104 isolates were clustered into 14 groups. The sequencing of the representative isolates revealed that the majority belonged to the genus Bacillus, while three isolates belonged to Paenibacillus, Lysinibacillus and Orthinibacillus. There were a few species like Orthinibacillus contaminans, B. oleronius, B. safensis, B. methylotrophicus, B. stratosphericus, B. aryabhattai, B. asahii and B. bataviensis that were prevalent only in DEIF and CEIF but not in WIF field soil. The diversity index parameters like the Shannon Index, indices of species richness and species evenness based on biochemical profiling and ARDRA profiling revealed that Bacillaceae members in the fresh water irrigated field were diverse.

AB Macrobenthic community changes were assessed in relation to different levels of fishing intensity following a before-after, control-impact experimental design with a control, a moderately impacted area, and a highly impacted area. Samples were collected before, immediately after, and 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 120 days after fishing. Communities in fished areas showed short-term significant effects on abundance, number of species, biomass, and diversity 1-3 days after fishing, with fished areas presenting lower mean values than the control. The opposite pattern was found for the carnivore-to-suspension feeding ratio. The main taxonomic groups showed different responses to fishing. Only gastropod abundance and the abundance of the polychaete families Pectinariidae and Sabellidae showed persistent negative effects of fishing. The effects on these polychaete families confirms the sensitivity of sedentary and suspension feeders to fishing. Some variables presented slightly higher negative effects with fishing intensity, but differences were subtle. Between 30 days and 120 days, a period of storms occurred, resulting in a general decrease of biological variables in all areas. This decrease was usually more pronounced than after fishing. The general short-term effects of fishing observed may reflect the resilience of communities that are able to cope with frequent natural disturbance events.

AB Clonality resulting from the growth of specialized organs is common among plants in wetland habitats. We hypothesize that different wetland habitats select for different attributes of clonal traits. This hypothesis is based on studies of individual species but has not been previously tested at the level of habitat. We compared the functional diversity of clonal growth traits of plants in bogs, fens, wet heathlands, floodplains, river beds, open fresh water habitats, salt marshes, and open marine habitats. Clonal traits (including number of offspring, lateral spread, persistence of connections between ramets, and shoot life span) were analysed with multivariate techniques using species frequency data and with permutation tests using presence/absence data. Based on species frequencies, clonal plants in aquatic habitats (open fresh water habitats, open marine habitats, and river beds) were characterized by the abundant production of freely dispersible propagules, annual shoots, and splitting clones. Species of daily flooded salt marshes were characterized by bi-annual connections between ramets and medium dispersability. In contrast, plants in permanently wet bogs were characterized by polycyclic shoots and low offspring production. The specificity of river beds and open freshwater habitats was also confirmed by permutation tests, which gave equal weight to rare and abundant species. However, species in all other wetland habitats were characterized by the entire range of clonal traits, suggesting weak environmental filtering of analyzed traits by habitat at the present scale.

AB Adaptive radiations are known for rapid morphological and species diversification in response to ecological opportunity, but it remains unclear if distinct mechanisms drive this pattern. Here, we show that rapid rates of morphological diversification are linked to the evolution of novel ecological niches in two independent Cyprinodon radiations nested within a wide-ranging group repeatedly isolated in extreme environments. We constructed a molecular phylogeny for the Cyprinodontidae, measured 16 functional traits across this group, and compared the likelihoods of single or multiple rates of morphological diversification. We found that rates of morphological diversification within two sympatric Cyprinodon clades containing unique trophic specialists are not part of an adaptive continuum with other clades, but are instead extreme outliers with rates up to 131 times faster than other Cyprinodontidae. High rates were not explained by clade age, but were instead linked to unique trophic niches within Cyprinodon, including scale-eating, zooplanktivory, and piscivory. Furthermore, although both radiations occur in similar environments and have similar sister species, they each evolved unique trophic specialists and high rates of morphological diversification in different sets of traits. We propose that the invasion of novel ecological niches may be a key mechanism driving many classic examples of adaptive radiation.

AB The benthic community was analyzed to evaluate pollution-induced changes for the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated site at Hunters Point (HP) relative to 30 reference sites in San Francisco Bay, California, USA. An analysis based on functional traits of feeding, reproduction, and position in the sediment shows that HP is depauperate in deposit feeders, subsurface carnivores, and species with no protective barrier. Sediment chemistry analysis shows that PCBs are the major risk drivers at HP (1,570 ppb) and that the reference sites contain very low levels of PCB contamination (9 ppb). Different feeding traits support the existence of direct pathways of exposure, which can be mechanistically linked to PCB bioaccumulation by biodynamic modeling. The model shows that the deposit feeder Neanthes arenaceodentata accumulates approximately 20 times more PCBs in its lipids than the facultative deposit feeder Macoma balthica and up to 130 times more than the filter feeder Mytilus edulis. The comparison of different exposure scenarios suggests that PCB tissue concentrations at HP are two orders of magnitude higher than at the reference sites. At full scale, in situ sorbent amendment with activated carbon may reduce PCB bioaccumulation at HP by up to 85 to 90% under favorable field and treatment conditions. The modeling framework further demonstrates that such expected remedial success corresponds to exposure conditions suggested as the cleanup goal for HP. However, concentrations remain slightly higher than at the reference sites. The present study demonstrates how the remedial success of a sorbent amendment, which lowers the PCB availability, can be compared to reference conditions and traditional cleanup goals, which are commonly based on bulk sediment concentrations.

AB Loss of ecological integrity due to excessive suspended sediment in rivers and streams is a major cause of water quality impairment in the USA. Current assessment protocols for development of sediment total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) lack a means to link temporally variable sediment transport rates with specific losses of ecological functions as loads increase. In order to accomplish this linkage assessment, a functional traits-based approach was used to correlate site occurrences of 17 fish species traits in three main groups (preferred rearing habitat, trophic feeding guild, and spawning behavior) with suspended sediment transport metrics. The sediment transport metrics included concentrations, durations, and dosages for a range of exceedance frequencies; and mean annual suspended sediment yields (SSY). In addition, this study in the Northwestern Great Plains Ecoregion examined trait relationships with three environmental gradients: channel stability, drainage area, and elevation. Potential stressor responses due to elevated suspended sediment concentration (SSC) levels were correlated with occurrences of five traits: preferred pool habitat; feeding generalists, omnivores, piscivores, and nest-building spawners; and development of ecologically based TMDL targets were demonstrated for specific SSC exceedance frequencies. In addition, reduced site occurrences for preferred pool habitat and nest-building spawners traits were associated with unstable channels and higher SSY. At an ecoregion scale, a functional traits assessment approach provided a means to quantify relations between biological impairment and episodically elevated levels of suspended sediment, supporting efforts to develop ecologically based sediment TMDLs.

AB Studies investigating the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem processes have often reached different conclusions, probably because insufficient attention has been paid to some aspects including (1) which biodiversity measure (e.g., species number, species identity or trait) better explains ecosystem functioning, (2) the mechanisms underpinning biodiversity effects, and (3) how can environmental context modulates biodiversity effects. Here, we investigated how species number (one to three species) and traits of aquatic fungal decomposers (by replacement of a functional type from an unpolluted site by another from a metal-polluted site) affect fungal production (biomass acumulation) and plant litter decomposition in the presence and absence of metal stress. To examine the putative mechanisms that explain biodiversity effects, we determined the contribution of each fungal species to the total biomass produced in multicultures by real-time PCR. In the absence of metal, positive diversity effects were observed for fungal production and leaf decomposition as a result of species complementarity. Metal stress decreased diversity effects on leaf decomposition in assemblages containing the functional type from the unpolluted site, probably due to competitive interactions between fungi. However, dominance effect maintained positive diversity effects under metal stress in assemblages containing the functional type from the metal-polluted site. These findings emphasize the importance of intraspecific diversity in modulating diversity effects under metal stress, providing evidence that trait-based diversity measures should be incorporated when examining biodiversity effects.

AB 1. The use of trait-based approaches to examine the ecology of stream fish assemblages is increasing. However, selection of traits that will be useful in testing spatial or temporal hypotheses about ecological organisation is currently limited by availability of data, rather than empirical evaluation.
   2. We analysed two data sets of stream fish assemblages to compare taxonomy and trait-based approaches. The Wabash River temporal data set is based on 25 years of boat electrofishing collections over a 230-km river distance. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management data set of stream collections in the state of Indiana was selected to represent a spatial database. We compared several trait-based approaches: reproductive guilds, life history variables, biomonitoring metrics, ecosystem-based functional guilds and feeding and ecosystem interaction guilds.
   3. Analyses of fish assemblages that are designed to detect how environmental variation structures fish assemblages can expect similar results using taxonomic or trait-based approaches. Results of trait-based approaches will vary according to the spatial extent of the region and the number of unique entities of trait groups for a given data set. However, taxonomic analyses accounted for more variation than any trait-based analyses.

AB Dodonaea 'Dana' is an Israeli hybrid with purple tinted leaves, cultivated for cut foliage branches. Cut Dodonaea branches showed strong seasonal variations in longevity, wilting after one week in winter, while displaying a vase life of three weeks in summer. We examined the relationship between functional anatomy, including vessel, stomata and trichome densities, vessel member length and leaf thickness, and water status of cut branches during vase life over two consecutive seasons, in relation to the average monthly day temperature. All the vascular and leaf anatomy traits examined were significantly correlated with seasonal average monthly day temperature. On day one of vase life the branch water status was positively correlated with vessel, stomata, and trichome densities, and negatively correlated with vessel member length and leaf thickness. However, on day 16, the branch water status was negatively correlated only with vessel member length and diameter, implying different relative importance of anatomical parameters for surviving water stress in the vase. Our results suggest that Dodonaea 'Dana' branches exhibit a strong interconnection between environmental parameters and postharvest performance, showing temperature-related seasonal anatomical changes, which lead to differential hydraulic performance during vase life.

AB Many teleost fishes in lowland fresh waters spawn in ephemeral flooded areas, the bottoms of which are prone to hypoxia. Little is known about how embryos and larvae deal with these potentially hostile environments. This study examines the functional and behavioral ontogeny of one such species, the kissing loach (Parabotia curta). Kissing loach eggs are demersal and adhesive. Hatching occurs at 24.8 +/- A 0.1 h post-fertilization at 25A degrees C, much earlier than most fish species. The newly hatched larvae are precocious with no functional mouth, fins or eye pigmentation. Swimbladder inflation normally occurs at about 4 days posthatch, even before which the hatched larvae moved immediately toward the water surface to hang from water moss. Experiments with larvae 20 h after hatching showed that they spent significantly less time on the bottom in hypoxic water (2 mg/l) than in normoxic water, and suggest that hypoxia is a major directive factor in eliciting surfacing behavior. For the kissing loach, we have previously reported short-term spawning after the formation of flood areas as well as wide scattering of the spawned eggs in the temporal flooded areas. These traits with the present results of hatching at an early stage and the immediate upward movement of larvae are considered to be effective strategies for using ephemeral, hypoxic flooded areas for reproduction.

AB Aim A fundamental question in community ecology is whether general assembly rules determine the structure of natural communities. Although many types of assembly rules have been described, including Diamond's assembly rules, constant body-size ratios, favoured states, and nestedness, few studies have tested multiple assembly rule models simultaneously. Therefore, little is known about the relative importance of potential underlying factors such as interspecific competition, inter-guild competition, selective extinction and habitat nestedness in structuring community composition. Here, we test the above four assembly rule models and examine the causal basis for the observed patterns using bird data collected on islands of an inundated lake.
   Location Thousand Island Lake, China.
   Methods We collected data on presence-absence matrices, body size and functional groups for bird assemblages on 42 islands from 2007 to 2009. To test the above four assembly rule models, we used null model analyses to compare observed species co-occurrence patterns, body-size distributions and functional group distributions with randomly generated assemblages. To ensure that the results were not biased by the inclusion of species with extremely different ecologies, we conducted separate analyses for the entire assemblage and for various subset matrices classified according to foraging guilds.
   Results The bird assemblages did not support predictions by several competitively structured assembly rule models, including Diamond's assembly rules, constant body-size ratios, and favoured states. In contrast, bird assemblages were highly significantly nested and were apparently shaped by extinction processes mediated through area effects and habitat nestedness. The nestedness of bird assemblages was not a result of passive sampling or selective colonization. These results were very consistent, regardless of whether the entire assemblage or the subset matrices were analysed.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that bird assemblages were shaped by extinction processes mediated through area effects and habitat nestedness, rather than by interspecific or inter-guild competition. From a conservation point of view, our results indicate that we should protect both the largest islands with the most species-rich communities and habitat-rich islands in order to maximize the number of species preserved.

AB Species present in communities are affected by the prevailing environmental conditions, and the traits that these species display may be sensitive indicators of community responses to environmental change. However, interpretation of community responses may be confounded by environmental variation at different spatial scales. Using a hierarchical approach, we assessed the spatial and temporal variation of traits in coastal fish communities in Lake Huron over a 5-year time period (2001-2005) in response to biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The association of environmental and spatial variables with trophic, life-history, and thermal traits at two spatial scales (regional basin-scale, local site-scale) was quantified using multivariate statistics and variation partitioning. We defined these two scales (regional, local) on which to measure variation and then applied this measurement framework identically in all 5 study years. With this framework, we found that there was no change in the spatial scales of fish community traits over the course of the study, although there were small inter-annual shifts in the importance of regional basin- and local site-scale variables in determining community trait composition (e.g., life-history, trophic, and thermal). The overriding effects of regional-scale variables may be related to inter-annual variation in average summer temperature. Additionally, drivers of fish community traits were highly variable among study years, with some years dominated by environmental variation and others dominated by spatially structured variation. The influence of spatial factors on trait composition was dynamic, which suggests that spatial patterns in fish communities over large landscapes are transient. Air temperature and vegetation were significant variables in most years, underscoring the importance of future climate change and shoreline development as drivers of fish community structure. Overall, a trait-based hierarchical framework may be a useful conservation tool, as it highlights the multi-scaled interactive effect of variables over a large landscape.

AB With global climate changes, biological invasions are considered to be one of the main causes of the decline of freshwater biodiversity. In this context, predicted increases in global temperature may alter the geographical distributions of native and invasive species. The purpose of our study was to examine the metabolic, behavioral and physiological responses to short-term temperature acclimation of two widely distributed species (the most successful European invader, Dikerogammarus villosus, and its main victim, Gammarus pulex), in order to estimate the potential effect of global warming on its invasion of freshwater ecosystems. Our results show that D. villosus is more vulnerable to high temperatures than G. pulex. The native species seems to be best adapted to intermediate temperatures (10-20 degrees C) with a possibility of adjustment to "extreme" temperatures (5-27 degrees C), whereas the "killer shrimp" D. villosus seems best adapted to lower temperatures (5-10 degrees C) with a limited possibility of adjustment above 20 degrees C In the light of our results, global warming is likely to be less favorable to the invasive species. However, D. villosus showed reduced metabolic and activity rates, associated with higher glycogen content. This adaptive strategy was interpreted as having functional advantages, allowing D. villosus to successfully invade harsh and/or unpredictable biotopes. In addition, our results show that glycogen stores may be used as a powerful indicator of the optimal thermal window for aquatic ectotherms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The relation of macrobenthic species turnover (beta diversity) and species plylogenetic variation with functional diversity patterns, across an environmental gradient induced by an aquaculture unit, in a coastal area of the island of Lesvos (NE Aegean) has been investigated in this study. The contribution of rare species response and species dispersal ability in the variation of functional diversity patterns along the environmental gradient, on a spatio-temporal scale, has been also examined. Our results revealed that benthic functional diversity was decreasing monotonically with increasing species turnover rate and hence with increasing spatial variability along the environmental gradient. Increased environmental stress which was detected in the immediate vicinity of the fish cages resulted to low species functional redundancy, since different species didn't perform the same functional role at the most disturbed part of the established gradient. Functional diversity patterns were found to be correlated with species population size, whereas a strong linear relationship was also detected with phylogenetic diversity patterns, thus supporting the claim that wider local taxonomic trees can support a wider range of species functions even in small spatial scales. Rare species loss seemed to be one of the dominant factors ruling functional diversity variation. Species with the minimum possible dispersal ability, which were mostly rare, tend to diminish both in species number and population size faster than species with wider dispersal ability towards the most disturbed areas. The aforementioned results indicate that rare species variation and endemic species loss are critical factors in determining functional diversity loss across a human-induced environmental gradient in soft bottom benthic communities.

AB 1. Biological invasions are among the most serious threats to freshwater biodiversity. Analysis of long-term data can be a positive first step toward properly identifying the ecological and economic damage caused by invasive species. This study assessed the potential impacts of invasive channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), which have multiplied dramatically since around 2000 in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, on native fish and shrimp and the commercial fishery using fishery-independent, quantitative long-term monitoring data (1993 2007).
   2. Temporal changes in abundance of 17 native fish species and one native shrimp species were analysed, and their sensitivity was evaluated, measured as change in relative abundance to the increase in I. punctatus abundance, was evaluated. A trait analysis of 18 species was performed in an attempt to investigate biological traits related to a negative sensitivity to I. punctatus invasion.
   3. After controlling for the effect of trophic status (total nitrogen and total phosphorus), nine of the 18 native species declined significantly through time and showed negative sensitivity to the increase in I. punctatus abundance; these included all four species used as raw materials for Japanese traditional processed foods. The trait-based analysis also revealed that benthic species and/or the species with a narrow diet range have decreased in abundance with increasing I. punctatus abundance. This suggests that competition for food, rather than predation by I. punctatus, is an important mechanism that results in a negative impact on native species.
   4. This study suggests that I. punctatus invasion may change the native community composition and negatively influence commercially important species, leading to a reduction in the provision of ecosystem goods. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   Utricularia australis is a submerged rootless aquatic carnivorous plant with homogeneous shoots, exhibiting a great morphological and ecological plasticity and propagating only vegetatively by shoot branching. Detailed branching and morphometric characteristics of two U. australis populations were compared at two sites in the Trebon basin, Czech Republic. The sites, mesotrophic fishpond Ruda and oligotrophic sand-pit Cep, differed greatly in their trophic status and prey availability, and thus in plant size, fitness, and flowering. Flowering plants at Ruda were robust, highly branched, and produced on average totally 52 branches of various orders forming about 52.9 % dry weight of the total vegetative plant dry weight. All plants collected were on average relatively short, 12.5 % flowered, and 90 % contained a branch >3 cm long with functional traps. In comparison, plants at Cep were much shorter, their internodes were strongly shortened, only 5 % of plants flowered, and only 60 % of plants bore distinguishable branches (on average only 1.1 branches a plant and 1.4 % of total plant dry weight). Shoot branching was recognized as one of the most important reasons for high plasticity of U. australis and for attaining high relative growth rate. Branching intensity of main shoots in U. australis might reflect discrete ecological conditions of each micropopulation. To understand the dynamic growth traits of aquatic carnivorous plants, a combination of branching characteristics and mathematical modelling is essential.

AB Benthic macrofauna can influence inputs and transformations of energy and matter in estuaries, affecting both the stocks of vital materials (e.g. carbon, oxygen) and the rates of key processes (e.g. organic matter decomposition, nutrient uptake). Although a number of studies have identified shifts in functional groups or biological traits in relation to anthropogenic stressors, there have been few field-based assessments of changes in functioning associated with stress gradients. We used a comparative experimental approach to investigate functioning on two sandflats with differing exposures to urban contaminants. Apart from significant differences in sediment contaminant concentrations (43.2 +/- 1.8 mg kg-1 Zn and 15.6 +/- 0.9 mg kg-1 Pb at the Pollen site; 17.7 +/- 0.7 mg kg-1 Zn and 7.9 +/- 0.9 mg kg-1 Pb at the Waiheke site), the two sandflats were readily comparable: both had similar sediment grain size distributions and were dominated by the same macrofaunal species; and both were in non-eutrophic New Zealand marine reserves with low ambient sediment organic matter content. To better understand the effects of contaminants on biologically mediated transformations of organic matter into inorganic nutrients, we manipulated sediment organic matter content and macrofaunal abundance in standardized treatments at each site. Fluxes of oxygen and ammonium, which are linked to key sandflat processes such as organic matter decomposition and benthic photosynthesis, were measured as response variables 1 week after the experimental manipulations. We predicted more efficient organic matter processing on the uncontaminated flat and thus expected to see elevated ammonium efflux in response to organic enrichment treatments at this site. Higher rates of benthic photosynthesis were predicted for plots with higher ammonium efflux, as ammonium is a readily utilizable form of limiting inorganic nitrogen. We documented significant positive relationships between ammonium uptake and benthic primary production on the uncontaminated flat, but weaker/insignificant relationships at the contaminated site. Our data were consistent with theories of increased variability and a decoupling of system processes with increasing amounts of stress.

AB The influence of functional traits on floristic patterns remains poorly understood in tropical rain forests. This contribution explores whether patterns of endemism of plant species are influenced by their life form and mode of dispersal. We used a comprehensive dataset of 3650 georeferenced plant specimens collected in Cameroon belonging to 115 taxa of Orchidaceae and 207 Rubiaceae endemic to Atlantic Central Africa. Species diversity of each family was compared using raw species richness (SR) and an index of species diversity (S (k) ) using subsampling procedure to correct for sampling bias. Measures were compared at three scales (square grids of one half-degree and one-degree per side and ecoregions) and according to elevation and continentality gradients. Species similarity between grid cells was measured using the sample-size corrected NNESS index. For both families, SR and S (k) decreased along the continentality gradient. In forest habitats below 1500 m altitude, both Orchidaceae and Rubiaceae show similar endemism patterns, but they differ in intensity. At higher altitudes, S (k) is higher for orchids due to the presence of endemic terrestrial taxa in grasslands, where the endemic Rubiaceae flora is rather poor. Substantial endemism observed at the ecoregion level and turnover analysis supported the role of the Sanaga River as a phytogeographical boundary. Similar endemism patterns were observed in lowland forests for Orchidaceae and Rubiaceae, even though Orchidaceae are assumed to have better long distance dispersal capabilities. The dispersal ability of Orchidaceae could be limited by the need of specific mycorhizal fungi for seed germination or host specificity for epiphytic orchids.

AB The Ecological Evaluation Index continuous formula (EEI-c) was designed to estimate the habitat-based ecological status of rocky coastal and sedimentary transitional waters using shallow benthic macrophyte communities as bioindicators. This study aimed to remedy the weaknesses of the currently used EEI methodology in: (1) ecological status groups (ESG), (2) the formula, and (3) reference condition values.
   A cluster analysis of twelve species traits was used to delineate ESGs. Two main clusters (ESG I, late-successional; ESG II, opportunistic) were identified that were hierarchically divided into three and two sub-clusters, respectively: ESG I comprised thick perennial (IA), thick plastic (IB) and shade-adapted plastic (IC) coastal water species, and angiosperm plastic (IA), thick plastic (IB) and shade-adapted plastic (IC) transitional water species. ESG II comprised fleshy opportunistic (IIB) and filamentous sheet-like opportunistic (I IA) species both in coastal and transitional waters.
   To avoid discrete jumps at the boundaries between predefined ecological categories, a hyperbolic model that approximates the index values and expresses the ecosystem status in continuous numbers was developed. Seventy-four quantitative and destructive samples of the upper infralittoral Cystoseira crinita and coastal lagoon Ruppia cirrhosa communities from tentative pristine to less impacted sites in Greece verified 10 as an 'ideal' EEI-c reference condition value.

AB P>Despite growing attention on the influence of functional diversity changes on ecosystem functioning, a palaeoecological perspective on the long-term dynamic of functional diversity, including mass extinction crises, is still lacking. Here, using a novel multidimensional functional framework and comprehensive null-models, we compare the functional structure of Cambrian, Silurian and modern benthic marine biotas. We demonstrate that, after controlling for increases in taxonomic diversity, functional richness increased incrementally between each time interval with benthic taxa filling progressively more functional space, combined with a significant functional dissimilarity between periods. The modern benthic biota functionally overlaps with fossil biotas but some modern taxa, especially large predators, have new trait combinations that may allow more functions to be performed. From a methodological perspective, these results illustrate the benefits of using multidimensional instead of lower dimensional functional frameworks when studying changes in functional diversity over space and time.

AB Low-flow disturbances are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity because of climate change and extensive human water withdrawal, but the effect of decreased flow on aquatic insect communities is not well understood. I explored the resistance of aquatic insects to reduced flow by creating an experimental low-flow disturbance that diverted similar to 40 to 80% of the water in 3 replicate streams for 2 summers. I sampled the aquatic insect community in control and treatment reaches before and during the 3-mo water diversions. I used a trait-based approach to analyze the data because traits have the potential to increase mechanistic understanding and predictive capabilities. The analysis focused on 6 traits: desiccation resistance, maximum crawling rate, armoring, size at maturity, rheophily, and habit. Community trait composition underwent strong seasonal shifts, but few consistent responses to reduced flow were observed. The 2 trait states that did appear to confer increased resistance were high crawling rate and armoring. These trait states can provide protection from predators. Thus, biotic interactions might be important during low-flow disturbance.

AB The concept of functional trait-environment relationship posits that species in a local community should possess similar traits that match the selective environment. The present study examines species trait-habitat (using Fourth-corner and RLQ analyses) and habitat occupancy patterns (logistic regression models) of bird assemblages in boreal forest stands following disturbances by forest fire and salvage logging. The stands differed in the amount and composition of residual tree retention, salvage- and aquatic-edges, degree of burn severity (all measured at 100 and 500 m buffers), as well as landscape-level variables such as distance to previously burned forests. Tests of trait-habitat relationships showed that canopy-nesters and bark- and foliage- insectivores required high levels of residual trees of low burn severity, with the feeding guilds showing affinity for different stand composition. In contrast, ground-nesters and omnivores thrived in salvaged areas and associated edges. In addition, cavity-nesting and ground-foragers were associated with severely burned stands. The species' habitat occupancy patterns were commensurate with trait requirements, which also appeared to be scale-dependent. For example, some fire-associated species had high occupancy probability in severely burned stands at small-scale (100 m buffer), which was consistent with their cavity-nesting trait. This pattern, however, was not evident at large-scale, where their feeding requirement (bark-insectivores) for low-severity burns dominated. Our study suggests that trait-habitat relationships can provide critical information to the complex ways species' relate to key habitat factors following natural and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Among-site variation in metacommunities (beta diversity) is typically correlated with the distance separating the sites (spatial lag). This distance decay in similarity pattern has been linked to both niche-based and dispersal-based community assembly hypotheses. Here we show that beta diversity patterns in community composition, when supplemented with functional-trait information, can be used to diagnose assembly processes. First, using simulated data, we show how the relationship between distance decay patterns in taxonomic and functional measures of community composition can be used to predict the influence of a given trait on community assembly. We then use the patterns generated by the simulation as a template to show that the sorting of benthic macroinvertebrate metacommunities in headwater streams is likely influenced by different sets of functional traits at regional and local scales. We suggest that functional-trait databases and spatially referenced taxonomic surveys can be used to predict the spatial scales at which different aspects of interspecific functional variation are involved in niche-based community assembly while accounting for the influence of dispersal-based community assembly processes.

AB We compiled a database on a priori selected traits for South-East Australian freshwater macroinvertebrate families and used this data for the development of a biotic indicator for the detection of the effects of salinisation on freshwater communities (SPEAR(salinity)) and for the adaptation of the existing SPEAR(pesticides) index for South-East Australian taxa. The SPEAR(salinity) indicator showed a reasonably high relationship (0.38 <= r(2) <= 0.5) with salinity in terms of logarithmic electrical conductivity (log EC) using field biomonitoring data from 835 pools and riffle sites in Victoria and South Australia. Several other biotic indexes that were calculated for comparison purpose exhibited a lower relationship with log EC. In addition, SPEAR(salinity) was the only indicator that did not respond to other water quality variables and was therefore most selective. We used log EC data and modelled pesticide exposure for sites in Victoria in concert with SPEAR(salinity) and the existing SPEAR(pesticides) index to assess whether pesticides interacts with effects of salinity on invertebrate communities and vice versa. No interaction with pesticides was found for the effect: of log EC on SPEAR(salinity), whereas EC interacted with the estimated pesticide exposure on the invertebrate communities. To foster the development of further trait-based ecological indicators, we suggest a conceptual model that predicts response traits based on the disturbance regime and disturbance mode of action of the stressor. Biotic indicators based on a priori selected traits represent a promising biomonitoring tool even for regions where ecological information is scarce. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Run timing in Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha is a life history trait that varies among populations throughout the Columbia River basin and has a demonstrated genetic basis. In this study, we used 92 single-nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers linked to at least 75 different functional genes (including OtsClock1a) to test for correlations with run timing. We obtained samples of adult Chinook salmon on a weekly basis as they passed a fixed point (Bonneville Dam) on the lower Columbia River main stem during the majority of the migratory run from April to October for three sequential years from 2007 to 2009 (n = 2,731, 3,479, and 2,960, respectively). Since these fish represented unknown mixtures of the three major genetic lineages in the Columbia River basin, we used genetic stock identification to assign individuals to their likely stock of origin. We then determined whether allelic variation at the SNP loci was correlated with the date of passage of fish in the context of stock of origin. Nine SNP loci were identified as candidates based on significant correlations with date of passage using the spatial analysis method. A multivariate analysis was then used to rank these eight candidate loci according to the proportion of genetic variation that day of passage explained relative to two other predictor variables: population structure and temperature. The three top-ranked loci were Ots_TAPBP, Ots_97077-179R, and Ots_myoD-364, which have known involvement in immunological functioning and muscle differentiation. Future work will test candidate SNPs using run-timing information from fish of known origin within particular Columbia River subbasins to help validate the role of these genetic linkage groups in this important life history trait.

AB We developed and validated a single multimetric index based on predictive models that could evaluate anthropogenic disturbances in streams of three disparate ecoregions of Bolivia. To do so, we examined 45 candidate metrics reflecting different aspects of macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and function gleaned from available literature and for their potential to indicate degradation. More importantly, we integrated functional trait metrics to improve the sensitivity of our index. To quantify possible deviation from reference conditions, we first established and validated statistical models describing metric responses to natural environmental differences in the absence of any significant anthropogenic disturbance. We considered that the residual distributions of these models described the response range of each metric, independently of natural environmental influence. After testing the sensitivity of these residuals to a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance, we retained eight metrics that were used in the final assemblage index, four metrics based on richness and composition and four metrics based on biological traits. Our index performed well in discriminating between reference and disturbed sites, giving a significant negative linear response to a gradient of physical and chemical anthropogenic disturbances. After employing a probability survey design and sampling a relatively small number of sites throughout all major ecoregions of Bolivia, we believe our methodology can be used to develop a monitoring tool to evaluate status and trends in biological condition for streams of the entire country despite its complex and heterogeneous geology and climate.

AB Benthic epifauna was sampled in an area of 10 x 10 nautical miles in the German Bight. Samples were taken in January and July/August from 1998 to 2009. The ecological functioning of the epifaunal community was assessed using biological traits analysis (BTA). Twelve ecological traits of 26 epifaunal species were considered and analysed using non-metric multidimensional scaling (nmMDS). Anomalies in the sea surface temperature (SST) close to the study area were mainly above the long-term mean during the study period. SST was exceptionally high during the autumn months between 2002 and 2006. Additionally, the cold winter of 1995-96 was clearly reflected in strong negative SST anomalies. Trait composition changed in 2002, mainly due to a decreasing trend of traits related to an opportunistic life mode from 1998-2002. Traits related to reproduction showed a much clearer response to the high autumn SST anomalies from 2002 to 2006 than other traits. We concluded that the cold winter resulted in an increase in opportunistic species in the study area followed by characteristic post-disturbance succession stages to the point of an established community in 2002. This indicates a recovery time of epifaunal communities in the German Bight of 7-8 years. Additionally, the results give evidence that climate-induced variability of SST in the German Bight affects mainly the reproduction of epifaunal species rather than other traits such as feeding type.

AB The EC Water Frame Directive (WFD) states that all coastal water bodies must achieve 'good ecological status' by the year 2015. A range of different classification methods have been developed and used to define ecological status to support the WFD. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of using two different mesh sizes of sieve (1.0 and 0.5 mm) on zoobenthic assemblages and on the ecological status of benthic macrofauna (using the Brackish water benthic index, BBI) in three ecologically distinct archipelago areas (Inner, Middle and Outer) in the Aland Islands, Northern Baltic Sea. We performed a biological trait analysis (BTA) to evaluate differences in the functional (trait) diversity of macrofauna collected using different mesh sizes and estimate the ecological relevance of mesh size. The results showed that sieve mesh size had significant effects on the recorded number of species, abundance, and total biomass of the zoobenthos. Small-bodied species and juveniles (e. g. Macoma balthica) were not observed when using a 1.0-mm mesh. The ecological status (sensu WFD) was only slightly affected by the mesh size, and all areas had good or high ecological status. BTA showed a difference in trait composition when using 0.5- or 1.0-mm mesh, particularly in the Outer area, where the proportion of small-sized species was high. Our results highlight how biological traits, in addition to species number and biomass, can play a key role when analyzing ecosystem structure for assessment and classification of coastal ecosystems. We show that combining traditional monitoring for the EU WFD with a functional analysis strengthens our ability to interpret environmental quality, and thus increases the precision of our advice for management purposes.

AB In two related field studies: (1) a multiscale riparian forest inventory and (2) a comparative study of natural forest gap and nongap environments, we explored regeneration patterns of native riparian trees in relation to large- and small-scale ecological drivers in four western Oregon watersheds spanning a climatic gradient from dry to wet. Twenty-three tree species were classified by life history traits into five functional groups that differed in shade and drought tolerance; distribution and abundance of tree regeneration were analyzed by group. For most groups, seedling abundance varied substantially across the large scale climate gradient. In particular, drought tolerant species decreased sharply in abundance from the drier to wetter watersheds. Overall seedling frequency and diversity also decreased from the driest to wettest watersheds, while nurse log use increased. Regeneration of most, but not all, species was greater in gaps.
   Principal conclusions are that life history information was useful for categorizing species and quite predictive of regeneration behavior overall, yet for many species contextual factors such as climate, forest structure, and adjoining species were also very important. Species appeared to regenerate opportunistically wherever local conditions fell within their environmental tolerances and competitive abilities. Management or restoration of riparian forests, therefore, requires knowledge of site conditions, the life history of the riparian trees present, and in particular an understanding of the species' environmental tolerances, disturbance responses, and competitive abilities relative to one another.

AB Aim
   Using dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) in a tropical land-bridge island system, we test for the small island effect (SIE) in the species-area relationship and evaluate its effects on species richness and community composition. We also examine the determinants of species richness across island size and investigate the traits of dung beetle species in relation to their local extinction vulnerability following forest fragmentation.
   Location
   Lake Kenyir, a hydroelectric reservoir in north-eastern Peninsular Malaysia.
   Methods
   We sampled dung beetles using human dung baited pitfall traps on 24 land-bridge islands and three mainland sites. We used regression tree analyses to test for the SIE, as well as species traits related to local rarity, as an indication of extinction vulnerability. We employed generalized linear models (GLMs) to examine determinants for species richness at different scales and compared the results with those from conventional linear and breakpoint regressions. Community analyses included non-metric multidimensional scaling, partial Mantel tests, nestedness analysis and abundance spectra.
   Results
   Regression tree analysis revealed an area threshold at 35.8 ha indicating an SIE. Tree basal area was the most important predictor of species richness on small islands (< 35.8 ha). Results from GLMs supported these findings, with isolation and edge index also being important for small islands. The SIE also manifested in patterns of dung beetle community composition where communities on small islands (< 35.8 ha) departed from those on the mainland and larger islands, and were highly variable with no significant nestedness, probably as a result of unexpected species occurrences on several small islands. The communities exhibited a low degree of spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that dispersal limitation plays a part in structuring dung beetle assemblages. Species with lower baseline density and an inability to forage on the forest edge were found to be rarer among sites and hence more prone to local extinction.
   Main conclusions
   We highlight the stochastic nature of dung beetle community composition on small islands and argue that this results in reduced ecosystem functionality. A better understanding of the minimum fragment size required for retaining functional ecological communities will be important for effective conservation management and the maintenance of tropical forest ecosystem stability.

AB P>1. River regulation and exotic plant invasion threaten riverine ecosystems, and the two often co-occur. By altering water regimes, flow regulation can facilitate plant invasion by providing conditions that directly benefit invading species, or by reducing competition from native species unsuited to the modified conditions. Integrating water and weed management has the potential to limit riparian plant invasion and maximize the ecological benefit of environmental flows.
   2. We surveyed plant communities and modelled flood histories of 24 riparian wetlands along the regulated River Murray, south-eastern Australia. There were no suitable control rivers, so we compared modelled pre- and post-regulation hydrological data to quantify hydrological change in the study wetlands. Regression analyses revealed relationships between hydrological modification and cover of native non-weed, native weed and exotic weed groups and 10 individual species.
   3. Exotic cover was highest and native non-weed cover lowest in wetlands that had experienced the greatest change in hydrology - a reduction in peak flow. Native weeds did not respond to hydrological modification indicating that exotic species' success was not reliant on their generalist characteristics.
   4. By altering habitat filters, hydrological modification caused a decline in amphibious native non-weed species cover and simultaneously provided drier conditions that directly favoured the exotic species group dominated by terrestrial species. Exotic species were potentially further assisted by human-mediated dispersal.
   5. Species and functional diversity was inversely related to exotic cover. By shifting the balance between native and exotic taxa and changing community functional composition, flow regulation may disrupt the ecological function and ecosystem services of floodplain wetlands.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Worldwide, flow regulation has led to riverine ecosystems becoming more terrestrial. The success of most introduced plants relies on minimal inundation. In this study, flood magnitude was more important than frequency, timing, or duration for wetland flora because it reflects spatial extent and depth of flooding. Augmenting natural spring floods with environmental flows will kill terrestrial weeds and facilitate native macrophyte growth. Combined with strategies for managing particular amphibious weeds, we recommend flows of 117 000-147 000 ML day-1 for at least 2 days every 10 years for River Murray wetland weed management.

AB We synthesise traditional unstructured food webs, allometric body size scaling, trait-based modelling, and physiologically structured modelling to provide a novel and ecologically relevant tool for size-structured food webs. The framework allows food web models to include ontogenetic growth and life-history omnivory at the individual level by resolving the population structure of each species as a size-spectrum. Each species is characterised by the trait 'size at maturation', and all model parameters are made species independent through scaling with individual body size and size at maturation. Parameter values are determined from cross-species analysis of fish communities as life-history omnivory is widespread in aquatic systems, but may be reparameterised for other systems. An ensemble of food webs is generated and the resulting communities are analysed at four levels of organisation: community level, species level, trait level, and individual level. The model may be solved analytically by assuming that the community spectrum follows a power law. The analytical solution provides a baseline expectation of the results of complex food web simulations, and agrees well with the predictions of the full model on biomass distribution as a function of individual size, biomass distribution as a function of size at maturation, and relation between predator-prey mass ratio of preferred and eaten food. The full model additionally predicts the diversity distribution as a function of size at maturation. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We compiled light utilization traits for 56 species of freshwater phytoplankton to analyze group differences, trait trade-offs, and allometric scaling relationships. We also used these traits to explain differences in major group distributions along the light availability gradient in 527 lakes in the continental United States. Major taxonomic groups differed significantly in their light utilization traits. Cyanobacteria had the highest initial slope of the growth-irradiance curve (alpha) and low irradiance at the onset of photoinhibition, indicating adaptation to low light environments. Green algae had the highest maximal growth rates and low alpha, indicating adaptation to higher light environments. Groups capable of mixotrophy had traits indicative of poor light competitive abilities and high light requirements. Key light utilization traits scaled allometrically with cell size and exhibited trade-offs leading to contrasting ecological strategies; alpha and cell size were conserved at the highest taxonomic level (domain), indicating a fundamental trait divergence between prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton. In line with these trait differences, major groups showed different responses to light availability in natural conditions. The relative abundances of low light-adapted groups declined with increasing light availability and vice versa. The genera mean values of the initial slopes of the growth-irradiance curves were significantly negatively correlated with the slopes of the relationships between the genus's relative abundance and light availability characterized by Secchi depth in 527 lakes. This indicates that light utilization traits can be used to explain phytoplankton distributions in nature.

AB We conducted laboratory experiments with 85 assembled phytoplankton communities composed of species from four predefined functional groups (chlorophytes, diatoms, cyanobacteria, chrysophytes) to distinguish the relative importance of species diversity from functional group diversity on carbon uptake. We separated the observed diversity effects on carbon uptake into those caused by species with particularly important traits (selection effect) and those caused by positive interactions among species (e.g., complementary resource use or facilitation [complementarity effect]). Additionally, we measured the composition of photosynthetically active pigments and light absorbance in communities and monocultures, and related them to species and functional diversity effects on carbon accrual. Biodiversity effects were weak or even absent in pure cyanobacterial and diatom communities compared to strong effects in chlorophytes. Complementarity effects and light absorbance increased as functional (i.e., phylogenetic) diversity increased. There was a positive correlation between complementarity effects on carbon accrual and light absorbance. These findings support hypotheses regarding biodiversity-productivity relationships in phytoplankton communities based on niche separation along spectral light gradients.

AB Understanding the relationships between species biological traits and the environment is crucial to predicting the effect of habitat perturbations on fish communities. It is also an essential step in the assessment of the functional diversity. Using two complementary three-matrix approaches (fourth-corner and RLQ analyses), we tested the hypothesis that feeding-oriented traits determine the spatial distributions of littoral fish species by assessing the relationship between fish spatial distributions, fish species traits, and habitat characteristics in two Laurentian Shield lakes. Significant associations between the feeding-oriented traits and the environmental characteristics suggested that fish communities in small lakes (displaying low species richness) can be spatially structured. Three groups of traits, mainly categorized by the species spatial and temporal feeding activity, were identified. The water column may be divided in two sections, each of them corresponding to a group of traits related to the vertical distribution of the prey coupled with the position of the mouth. Lake areas of low structural complexity were inhabited by functional assemblages dominated by surface feeders while structurally more complex areas were occupied by mid-water and benthic feeders. A third group referring to the time of feeding activity was observed. Our work could serve as a guideline study to evaluate species traits x environment associations at multiple spatial scales. Our results indicate that three-matrix statistical approaches are powerful tools that can be used to study such relationships. These recent statistical approaches open up new research directions such as the study of spatially based biological functions in lakes. They also provide new analytical tools for determining, for example, the potential size of freshwater protected areas.

AB A facultatively aerobic deep brown coccoid to ovoid bacterium, strain EG17(T), was isolated from a saline effluent stream in the NaCl-dominated brine spring system known as East German Creek in the province of Manitoba, Canada. The strain produced BChl a incorporated into a functional reaction center and two light-harvesting complexes with absorption peaks at 802, 850, and 879 nm. EG17(T) is the first reported anoxygenic phototroph capable of photoheterotrophic growth under both oxic and anoxic conditions. It yielded proportionally the greatest aerobic photosynthetic biomass under oligotrophic conditions. The results of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that EG17(T) was related most closely to the aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs Roseibacterium elongatum (98.3%) and quite distantly to both Dinoroseobacter shibae (95.2%) and Roseicyclus mahoneyensis (94.7%). The DNA G + C content was 65.6 mol%. On the basis of the unique dual aerobic/anaerobic photosynthetic capability, the distinctive spectrophotometric absorption of the photosynthetic apparatus, diagnostic physiological and biochemical traits, and the moderate phylogenetic separation between EG17(T) and its nearest relatives, it is concluded that this microorganism should be classified as a novel genus and species, Charonomicrobium ambiphototrophicum gen. nov., sp. nov., with EG17(T) as the type strain.

AB Plant functional traits have been widely used to study the linkage between environmental drivers, trade-offs among different functions within a plant, and ecosystem structure and functioning. Here, the whole-plant traits, leaf morphological and physiological traits of two dominant species, Leymus chinensis (C-3 perennial rhizome grass) and Cleistogenes squarrosa (C-4 perennial bunchgrass), were studied in the Inner Mongolia grassland of China, with a grazing experiment including five stocking rates (0, 3.0, 4.5, 7.5, and 9.0 sheep/ha) in 2008 (wet year) and 2009 (dry year). Our results demonstrated that, for both species, the effects of stocking rate, year, and stocking rate x year on whole-plant traits and leaf morphological and physiological traits were highly significant in most cases. The differential responses of plant trait to variation in precipitation were caused by trait trade-offs between the wet and dry years. L. chinensis adopted the high N content and net photosynthetic rate (P-n) in the wet year but both the low N content and Pn in the dry year under grazed conditions. The trait trade-offs of C. squarrosa were characterized by high specific leaf area (SLA) and P-n in the dry year vs. low SLA and Pn in the wet year. Our findings also indicate that C. squarrosa is more resistant to grazing than L. chinensis in terms of avoidance and tolerance traits, particularly under heavy grazing pressure and in the dry year.

AB An ideal restoration species for the semi-arid Intermountain West, USA would be one that grows rapidly when resources are abundant in the spring, yet tolerates summer's drought. We compared two perennial C-3,C- Triticeae Intermountain-native bunchgrasses, the widely occurring Pseudoroegneria spicata and the much less widespread Elymus wawawaiensis, commonly used as a restoration surrogate for P. spicata. Specifically, we evaluated seedlings of multiple populations of each species for biomass production, water use, and morphological and physiological traits that might relate to drought tolerance under three watering frequencies (WFs) in a greenhouse. Shoot biomass of E. wawawaiensis exceeded that of P. spicata regardless of WF. At low WF, E. wawawaiensis displayed 38% greater shoot biomass, 80% greater specific leaf area (SLA), and 32% greater precipitation use efficiency (PUE). One E. wawawaiensis population, E-46, displayed particularly high root biomass and water consumption at high WF. We suggest that such a plant material could be especially effective for restoration of Intermountain rangelands by preempting early-season weeds for spring moisture and also achieving high PUE. Our data explain how E. wawawaiensis has been so successful as a restoration surrogate for P. spicata and highlight the importance of measuring functional traits such as PUE and SLA when characterizing restoration plant materials.

AB Due to their nutrient recycling function and their importance in food-webs, macroinvertebrates are essential for the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. These organisms also constitute an important component of biodiversity.
   Sediment evaluation and monitoring is an essential aspect of ecosystem monitoring since sediments represent an important component of aquatic habitats and are also a potential source of contamination. In this study, we focused on macroinvertebrate communities within run-of-river dams, that are prime areas for sediment and pollutant accumulation. Little is known about littoral macroinvertebrate communities within run-of-river dam or their response to sediment levels and pollution. We therefore aimed to evaluate the following aspects: the functional and structural composition of macroinvertebrate communities in run-of-river dams; the impact of pollutant accumulation on such communities, and the most efficient scales and tools needed for the biomonitoring of contaminated sediments in such environments. Two run-of-river dams located in the French alpine area were selected and three spatial scales were examined: transversal (banks and channel), transversal x longitudinal (banks/channel x tail/middle/dam) and patch scale (erosion, sedimentation and vegetation habitats). At the patch scale, we noted that the heterogeneity of littoral habitats provided many available niches that allow for the development of diversified macroinvertebrate communities. This implies highly variable responses to contamination. Once combined on a global 'banks' spatial scale, littoral habitats can highlight the effects of toxic disturbances. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ecological research is moving from a species-based to a functional-based approach to better understand the underlying principles that govern community dynamics. Studies of functional-based ecology, however, have been limited for zooplankton and particularly for rotifers. While rotifers show a variety of trophi types and coronal shapes, suggesting the importance of niche differentiation in their feeding strategy, relatively little is known of how this relates to rotifer dynamics. We used the guild ratio (GR', a ratio of raptorial to microphagous species), an index based on a functional trait (i.e. feeding strategy), as a novel approach to rotifer dynamics. We extracted the seasonal GR' by using seasonal trend decomposition and investigated similarities between study sites (Lake Washington, USA and Lake Caldonazzo, Italy) and its relation to cladocerans by cross-correlation analysis. Our study indicated that (i) raptorial and microphagous rotifers showed alternating dominance, and that raptorial rotifers and cladocerans had a synchronous pattern, (ii) the seasonal pattern of the GR' was consistent across different sampling frequencies, and (iii) the GR' was similar in both lakes. We interpreted these patterns as the general strength of the GR': discernment of species-environment relationships and robustness across sampling regimes. The limitations of the GR' (i.e. species identity is neglected, simplification of food preferences) can also be seen as its strong point: synthesis of multi-species patterns. In addition, the independence of GR' from species-level identification and its potential to make use of datasets with infrequent sampling intervals and low taxon resolution could further support its innovative aspect.

Sponges harbor a remarkable diversity of bacteria, however, little is known about the functional properties of such bacterial symbionts. In this study, we present the genomic and functional characterization of an uncultured delta-proteobacterium associated with the sponge Cymbastela concentrica. We show that this organism represents a novel phylogenetic clade and propose that it lives in association with a cyanobacterium. We also provide an overview of the predicted functional and ecological properties of this delta-proteobacterium, and discuss its complex interactions with surrounding cells and milieu, including traits of cell attachment, nutrient transport and protein-protein interactions.

AB Understanding the mechanisms that create spatial and temporal patterns of functional diversity in stream networks is a goal of basic research and has implications for effective conservation of freshwater ecosystems. These patterns are likely to be influenced by the combination of temporally variable environmental conditions, movement constraints imposed by network structure, and the trait composition of local communities. We developed a simplified metacommunity model to investigate complex interactions among these factors under lottery competition for local resources, such as establishment sites. We used this model to examine how local and regional community composition varied in 3 scenarios: a null implementation involving only spatial effects, an implementation that combined network constraints with dispersal-trait variation, and an implementation in which a trade-off between multiple functional traits was paired with varying levels of temporal autocorrelation in the intensity of mortality. These simulations clarified the conditions that allow a single functional strategy to exclude others in a dendritic network and demonstrated 2 distinct modes of regional partitioning that can support the persistence of multiple functional strategies within such networks. The results suggested that the emergence of watershed or headwater-outlet partitioning depends on the functional dispersal differences present in the metacommunity and that autocorrelated mortality levels can collapse these regional divisions when they depend on a trade-off between dispersal ability and mortality resistance. We discuss the need to confront the complexity of interacting controls on community composition in rivers and streams and suggest opportunities to move beyond the basic framework we present.

AB Recent meta-analyses suggest that ecosystem functioning increases with biodiversity, but contradictory results have been presented for some microbial functions. Moreover, observations of only one function underestimate the functional role of diversity because of species-specific trade-offs in the ability to carry out different functions. We examined multiple functions in batch cultures of natural freshwater bacterial communities with different richness, achieved by a dilution-to-extinction approach. Community composition was assessed by molecular fingerprinting of 16S rRNA and chitinase genes, representing the total community and a trait characteristic for a functional group, respectively. Richness was positively related to abundance and biomass, negatively correlated to cell volumes and unrelated to maximum intrinsic growth rate. The response of chitin and cellulose degradation rates depended on the presence of a single phylotype. We suggest that species identity and community composition rather than richness matters for specific microbial processes.

AB As populations adapt to novel environments, divergent selection will promote heterogeneous genomic differentiation via reductions in gene flow for loci underlying adaptive traits. Using a data set of over 100 SNP markers, genome scans were performed to investigate the effect of natural selection maintaining differentiation in five lakes harbouring sympatric pairs of normal and dwarf lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). A variable proportion of SNPs (between 0% and 12%) was identified as outliers, which corroborated the predicted intensity of competitive interactions unique to each lake. Moreover, strong reduction in heterozygosity was typically observed for outlier loci in dwarf but not in normal whitefish, indicating that directional selection has been acting on standing genetic variation more intensively in dwarf whitefish. SNP associations in backcross hybrid progeny identified 16 genes exhibiting genotype-phenotype associations for four adaptive traits (growth, swimming activity, gill rakers and condition factor). However, neither simple relationship between elevated levels of genetic differentiation with adaptive phenotype nor conspicuous genetic signatures for parallelism at outlier loci were detected, which underscores the importance of independent evolution among lakes. The integration of phenotypic, transcriptomic and functional genomic information identified two candidate genes (sodium potassium ATPase and triosephosphate isomerase) involved in the recent ecological divergence of lake whitefish. Finally, the identification of several markers under divergent selection suggests that many genes, in an environment-specific manner, are recruited by selection and ultimately contributed to the repeated ecological speciation of a dwarf phenotype.

AB Fine sediment in streams and rivers is one of the most globally widespread of all freshwater pollutants. However, the ecological implications are still poorly quantified, and field experiments to assess likely functional and structural effects are scarce.
   We assessed the response of stream invertebrates to fine sediment (i.e. inert sand) added to trays (n = 65) containing otherwise natural substrata over a three-week period in three replicate streams in the Usk catchment, Wales.
   Sediment addition to 0.6-18 kg m(-2) affected both the structure and functional composition of invertebrate assemblages while also reducing overall abundance and in some common species (Baetis rhodani, Ecdyonurus sp. and Leuctra geniculata).
   Sediment also reduced richness and overall trait diversity (TD), while different life-history traits were either favoured (polivoltinism, tegumental respiration and burrowing behaviour) or disfavoured (swimmers, attached taxa, gill respiration). Moreover, sediments appeared to promote a nested subset pattern in species composition, with generalists favoured at the expense of specialists either through exclusion or impaired colonization. Effects were due largely to the loss of five taxa that contributed to the significant nestedness across the sand gradient: B. rhodani, Ecdyonurus sp., Leuctra geniculata, Simuliidae and Ephemerella ignita.
   This short-term experiment supports recent surveys in indicating how sedimentation can change the structural and functional composition of stream invertebrate assemblages even at low to moderate rates of deposition. In revealing direct effects on trait adversity, trait representation and nestedness, the data are also consistent with survey data in indicating that sediments have potentially important ramifications for conservation by removing organisms systematically according to life-history features.

AB In this study we implemented a potted water supply experiment for 100 days by a completely random sole-factored design with five treatments: 100% (W-100). 80% (W-80), 60% (W-60). 40% (W-40) and 20% (W-20) of water holding capacity (WHC), corresponding to the soil volumetric water content (SVWC) maintained at 38.8 +/- 0.3%, 31.6 +/- 1.7%, 25.6 +/- 1.3%, 16.5 +/- 0.7%, and 8.1 +/- 1.1%, respectively. The objective was to evaluate the ability of the 2-month-old Campylotropis polyantha (Franch.) Schindl. seedlings to tolerate drought and to explore the mechanism resisting drought. We monitored the growth process of seedling height and leaf number monthly and further investigated those changes in plant growth, dry mass accumulation and allocation, water-use efficiency (WUE), leaf functional traits, chlorophyll a fluorescence and pigment contents across the water deficit gradient. We found that the seedlings presented optimal growth, dry mass production, and physiological activity only at the W-100 and W-80 treatments and afterwards significantly decreased with progressive water deficit: the WUE was improved under moderate water stress (W-60 and W-40) but reduced under severe stress (W-20). The serious leaf shedding, growth stopping and seedling death under the W-20 condition revealed that the current-year shrub seedlings could not withstand severe drought. Water stress-induced decrease in total plant leaf area due to a combination of limited expansion of younger leaves and shedding of old leaves caused the leaf area ratio reduction under drought. The reduced mesophyll cell was a major anatomical response of leaves along the water stress gradient. The progressive water stress significantly damaged light harvesting complex and reduced photochemical processes and PSII activity. Our results clearly showed that the current-year shrub seedlings took the avoidance and tolerance mechanisms to withstand progressive drought stress and around 25.6% SVWC and around 12.3% SVWC separately are thresholds to limit the optimal growth and dry mass production and to last growing and surviving for the current-year shrub seedlings.

AB This article addresses the Water Framework Directive and the legal norm of 'good ecological status', which refers to the structure and function of ecosystems. In terms of ecology, the concepts of good structure and function reflect a resilient ecosystem with a high level of adaptive capacity. However, the legal provisions of the Directive compromise this concept. The Directive's approach assumes that by quantifying certain fixed biological elements it is possible to accurately assess the structure and function of ecosystems. This approach is highly contestable, and undermines the possibility of attaining the objective of 'good ecological status'. To improve the possibility of achieving 'good ecological status', we emphasise the need to first redefine 'high ecological status' as a state wherein the ecosystems maintain themselves independently of management; secondly, that the hydrological regime be addressed when assessing the bodies of water; and, thirdly, that traits, rather than the current 'quality elements' be used as variables.

AB This study investigated the relationships of three major aquatic assemblages (diatom, macroinvertebrate, and fish) and environmental variables, including sub-basin, hydrology, land cover, and water quality variables on multiple scales. Samples were collected at 720 sampling sites on the Korean nationwide scale. Geological variables, including altitude and slope, showed a strong positive correlation with proportions of forest in land cover types and cobbles in substrates, while they were negatively correlated with water quality variables, including conductivity and total phosphorus. Considering the concordance of the different assemblages, species richness of fish and macroinvertebrates displayed significant correlation, and diatoms were significantly correlated with fish. However, diatoms did not show significant correlation with macroinvertebrates. Altitude and slope showed significant correlation with all biological variables of the three assemblages. Macroinvertebrates and fish showed positive relations with large substrate sizes. Indices of diatoms and macroinvertebrates well reflected the perturbation of water quality variables. However, fish indices showed a relatively low association with water quality variables, compared with those of diatoms and macroinvertebrates. These patterns were also confirmed by the ordination and prediction of biological indices with environmental variables through the learning process of a self-organizing map as well as random forest. Overall, our study supports the concept of multi-scale habitat filters and functional organization in streams, and is consistent with the recommended use of multiple biological indices with more than one assemblage for the assessment of the biotic integrity of aquatic ecosystems.

AB A fundamental feature of the Anthropocene is the inexorable erosion of the self-repairing capacity or adaptive renewal of natural systems because of natural perturbation, exploitation, or management failure. The concept of resilience offers a systematic framework for understanding the dynamics and variables that govern response dynamics of ecosystems. Resilience of haplochromine cichlids is assessed using limnological and biodiversity changes in Lake Victoria, the world's second largest freshwater lake, over the last five decades. The review explores the resurgence of the haplochromine cichlids using Holling's adaptive renewal cycle and attempts to illustrate how resilience-based management approaches might learn from an inadvertent management experiment. The introduction in the 1980s of the Nile perch (Lates niloticus), a fecund and voracious predator of the endemic phytoplankton feeding haplochromine cichlids, anthropogenic eutrophication, and deep water hypoxia have combined in a synergistic way to increase the vulnerability of the lake ecosystem to perturbations that were hitherto absorbed. However, the upsurge in commercial Nile perch fishing appears to be enabling the resurgence of the haplochromine cichlids. The resurgence of haplochromine cichlids is characterized by phenotypic plasticity, ecological and life history traits and demonstrates the critical role of response diversity in the maintenance of systems resilience. Resilience of the haplochromine cichlids resides in the requisite functional response diversity and habitat diversity that provide the resources for renewal and regeneration. This paper concludes that management of Nile perch fisheries and control of nutrient loading into Lake Victoria could halt or reverse eutrophication, hence offer the best promise for a diverse, productive, and resilient social-ecological system.

AB Excavation has enabled recovery of 854 artifacts within 30 archaeological levels in the south sector and 11 in the north (chapter 3). These levels are quite probably contemporaneous, or even the same. The quantitative disparity in the number of strata between the two sectors is simply due to the fact that only the lower half of the northern zone was completely investigated. Similarly, the number of artifacts recovered by level varies according to the surface area excavated, although is some cases the density of material is significant despite the small area excavated, for example stratum C IV 5 which contains 174 lithic artifacts in 2 m(2). Before undertaking the technological analysis of the artifacts, given the preceding polemics provoked by the great age of this site and its implications for the spread of the first populations out of Africa, it was deemed important to carry out a plurifactorial analysis combining all of the data related to: the stratigraphy, taphonomic processes (post-depositional disturbance), analysis of natural processes that may have produced eoliths, experimentation and techno-functional analysis of the material. The stratigraphy shows clear interstratifications of fine and coarse fluviatile levels with often very clear particle size sorting of the coarse fraction. The archaeological material is typically found at the interface of these strata, either at the base of a clayey matrix, overlying a preceding coarse level, or in the superficial part of a sandy-clay deposit underlying coarse deposits. Post-depositional disturbance revealed during the new excavations in 2003 2006 cannot alone be the cause of eoliths. Excavation of a 6 m2 zone in the modern river bed, located below the site, has demonstrated that the technological traits of eoliths recovered cannot in any way be confused with the technological traits of the artifacts recovered at the site itself. Similarly, viewed quantitatively, the 6 m2 zone excavated in the river bed yielded around 20 eoliths while the 30 m2 zone excavated at the site yielded 854 artifacts, one stratum alone yielding 184 artifacts in a 3 m2 zone. During the experimental phase, adopting the same conditions of procuring raw material, from the same river bed, we very quickly realized the rarity of types of adequate volume that had been generally used at the site and the need to use certain operational processes to create such a form. In addition, the hardness and presence of several natural fracture planes in the Triassic limestone explain the choice of different operational processes and the very high number of knapping accidents, including those occurring during bipolar percussion. Although 90% of the raw material used was cobbles or broken blocks of local Triassic limestone, 10% of the tools were made on exogenous raw materials siliceous or gravelly limestone, quartzitic sandstone, chert, volcanic rock that are absent from the immediate environment of the site. These raw materials were brought to the site in the form of tools: worked cobbles, large retouched flakes, backed double-truncated flakes, a plaquette with a lateral bifacial edge, etc. The 854 artifacts have been classified into six object classes: worked cobbles with transversal edge (39%), worked cobbles with lateral edge (2%), unipolar flakes (27%), bipolar objects (half-blocks, half-cobbles including some flat "split" cobbles, "orange slices", flakes and diverse fragments) (17%) and fragments resulting from knapping of blocks or cobbles (13%), hammerstone (2%).
   When the frequencies of these classes are calculatd for each of the sectors, percentages are similar, indicating a high degree of homogeneity in the archaeological assemblages at the site. The situation is somewhat different when assemblages are compared within a single sector. Slight differences appear in the percentages of bipolar pieces and 'unipolar flakes. These differences seem to be random, like the frequency rate of knapping accidents in bipolar reduction, or economic, such as the choice of operational schemes to create worked cobbles based on the availability of suitable raw materials. The technological affinity between each of the archaeological assemblages tends to demonstrate great stability in technological knowledge through time. The class of worked cobbles is by far the most important and, apart from a few flakes produced intentionally, it appears to group all of the tools. To avoid placing these tools in a restrictive, semantically meaningless, class, we prefer the concept of matrix to the term worked cobble. A matrix is a structured arrangement of a series of technological traits, in a form as close as possible to that of the future tool. The matrix phase leads to the tool production phase, which may be unnecessary if the matrix phase includes fictionalization. In other words, the concept of matrix enables separating the phase of preparing a predetermined volume, such as a blade, Levallois flake or bifacial piece, from the tool production phase, consisting in creating the type of transformative edge intended, if necessary. The tool is thus an artifact of a specific form with an integrated edge and an operational scheme both specific to the function attributed to it and means of use associated with the form. Observed variability relates to: the size of the volume ranging from to 20, morphology, the form of the line formed by the edge which can in frontal view be curved, linear, sinuous or denticulated, and in transversal view curved, linear, sinuous or saw-toothed, and the length of the edge ranging from 1 to 10. Matrices with a simple bevel are distinguished from double bevels. In the framework of the technological analysis of production schemes to produce matrices with a simple bevel, a broad range of variability in production schemes can be observed, divided arbitrarily into two stages. The first stage consists in creating as closely as possibly the technological traits of the future matrix due to five general schemes. The first scheme (A) consists in selecting a cobble or block naturally possessing at least some of the technological traits needed. The missing traits are added by various preparations, including bipolar percussion 3 times out of 5. The second scheme (B) consists in knapping a flake from the block with some of the technological traits required for the matrix present on one of its surfaces. The third scheme (C) consists in the choice of a plaquette from which a bipolar shock creates the main traits of the matrix. The fourth scheme (D) consists in choosing a volume very similar to the intended matrix. The fifth and final scheme (E) consists in knapping a flake with technological traits very different from those intended. Depending on the distance between intention and realization, a second stage may be necessary. In general, this second stage perfects or creates the intended active edge, which is rarely obtained in the first stage. To produce a matrix with a double bevel, it is sometimes necessary to add an intermediate stage in order to prepare the second bevel.
   The first stage remains the same, with te use of the five operational schemes. By contrast, a clear difference exists in the percentages for the use of these schemes. For a matrix with a simple bevel, scheme A is dominant, followed by scheme D, while the situation is reversed for a matrix with a double bevel, where scheme D is dominant. Unipolar flakes, representing 27% of the assemblage, are produced in three different ways. The most important is flakes resulting from matrix production. The two others are flakes produced during different knapping schemes, some flakes in relation to the few cores present, other flakes in exogenous raw materials produced elsewhere and generally much larger. The other classes are dominated by bipolar products resulting essentially from knapping accidents. To summarize, these assemblages are characterized by: the search for tools differentiated by form and active edges; more than 90% of the tools made on two kinds of supports: a matrix with a simple bevel or a double bevel; matrices obtained using different operational schemes successively associating if necessary a knapping stage and a shaping stage. While the Triassic limestone is hard and thus imposes a strong constraint on knapping, the range of operational schemes appears to have been a "cultural" response diversified to this constraint and the presence of tools on exogenous raw materials. At the scale of China, comparison of this industry is impossible since it is the only site of this age and to contain so much material. The site of Majuangou, the only site of similar caliber, is younger by several hundred thousand years and is located several thousand kilometers to the north, making comparisons meaningless. We note only that most of the tool supports at Majuangou are knapped flakes. On an inter-continental scale, the comparison of sites of equal age is more promising. But lithic analyses are based on different methods, preventing comparison of similar data. However, if we make a simple summary of the data available, we can first say that in Africa, during these periods, different development technological stages were present and stages that are considered more evolved are manifestly less common using our approach. While these stages are more or less contemporaneous, which counters the idea of uniqueness, they would more surely be evidence of populations that were not in direct contact and had separate lines of development. In Asia, the Longgupo industry evidences a different technological option than that of contemporaneous populations in Africa. By contrast, when we take into account its developmental stage, we realize that this is an "evolved" stage in which the form of the support of the future tool is predominant. If we compare Africa and Asia in terms of stages, we are a priori at the same stage with different options being selected. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB In spite of the relative importance of groundwater in costal dune systems, studies concerning the responses of vegetation to ground water (GW) availability variations, particularly in Mediterranean regions, are scarce. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to compare the responses of co-occurring species possessing different functional traits, to changes in GW levels (i.e. the lowering of GW levels) in a sand dune ecosystem. For that, five sites were established within a 1 km(2) area in a meso-mediterranean sand dune ecosystem dominated by a Pinus pinaster forest. Due to natural topographic variability and anthropogenic GW exploitation, substantial variability in depth to GW between sites was found. Under these conditions it was possible to identify the degree of usage and dependence on GW of different plant species (two deep-rooted trees, a drought adapted shrub, a phreatophyte and a non-native woody invader) and how GW dependence varied seasonally and between the heterogeneous sites. Results indicated that the plant species had differential responses to changes in GW depth according to specific functional traits (i.e. rooting depth, leaf morphology, and water use strategy). Species comparison revealed that variability in pre-dawn water potential (Psi(pre)) and bulk leaf delta C-13 was related to site differences in GW use in the deep-rooted (Pinus pinaster, Myrica faya) and phreatophyte (Salix repens) species. However, such variation was more evident during spring than during summer drought. The exotic invader, Acacia longifolia, which does not possess a very deep root system, presented the largest seasonal variability in Psi(pre) and bulk leaf delta C-13. In contrast, the response of Corema album, an endemic understory drought-adapted shrub, seemed to be independent of water availability across seasons and sites. Thus, the susceptibility to lowering of GW due to anthropogenic exploitation, in plant species from sand dunes, is variable, being particularly relevant for deep rooted species and phreatophytes, which seem to depend heavily on access to GW.

AB Mediterranean endemic freshwater fish are among the most threatened biota in the world. Distinguishing the role of different extinction drivers and their potential interactions is crucial for achieving conservation goals. While some authors argue that invasive species are a main driver of native species declines, others see their proliferation as a co-occurring process to biodiversity loss driven by habitat degradation. It is difficult to discern between the two potential causes given that few invaded ecosystems are free from habitat degradation, and that both factors may interact in different ways.
   Here we analyze the relative importance of habitat degradation and invasive species in the decline of native fish assemblages in the Guadiana River basin (southwestern Iberian Peninsula) using an information theoretic approach to evaluate interaction pathways between invasive species and habitat degradation (structural equation modeling, SEM). We also tested the possible changes in the functional relationships between invasive and native species, measured as the per capita effect of invasive species, using ANCOVA.
   We found that the abundance of invasive species was the best single predictor of natives' decline and had the highest Akaike weight among the set of predictor variables examined. Habitat degradation neither played an active role nor influenced the per capita effect of invasive species on natives. Our analyses indicated that downstream reaches and areas close to reservoirs had the most invaded fish assemblages, independently of their habitat degradation status. The proliferation of invasive species poses a strong threat to the persistence of native assemblages in highly fluctuating environments. Therefore, conservation efforts to reduce native freshwater fish diversity loss in Mediterranean rivers should focus on mitigating the effect of invasive species and preventing future invasions.

AB With increasing scarcity of fresh water available for aquaculture, especially in arid regions, development of tilapias that tolerate high salinity would increase fish (and hence, animal protein) production. We review culture practices, nutrition, physiology, and genetics, and propose approaches to improving salinity tolerance in tilapias. Physiological studies of biochemical pathways underlying phenotypic differences in salt tolerance can lead to genetic studies of intra and interspecific variation. Molecular technology can lead to studies on osmoregulation-related biochemical pathways, for which the euryhaline tilapia is an attractive model. Functional genomics and proteomics are powerful tools for studying the molecular bases of environmental adaptation and metabolic connections to osmoregulatory physiology. Both provide avenues for discovering novel pathways related to osmoregulation with relevance to aquaculture. Dietary supplementation with NaCl and optimized acclimation protocols are immediate and practical ways to improve salt tolerance. Inter-specific variation in salinity tolerance may be used to select salt-tolerant species and develop salt-tolerant hybrids. In the long term, quantitative trait loci associated with, or genes involved in, saltwater tolerance may facilitate marker-assisted or gene-assisted selection for this trait in tilapia.

AB Different environments should select for different aspects of organismal performance, which should lead to correlated divergence in morphological traits that influence performance. The result should be genetic divergence in aspects of performance, morphology and associations ('maps') between morphology and performance. Testing this hypothesis requires quantifying performance and morphology in multiple populations after controlling for environmental differences, but this is rarely attempted. We used a common-garden experiment to examine morphology and several aspects of swimming performance within and between the lake and inlet populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from the Misty system, Vancouver Island, Canada. Controlling for body size, lake stickleback had shallower bodies, larger caudal fins and smaller pelvic girdles. With or without morphological covariates, lake stickleback showed greater performance in both sustained and burst swimming. In contrast, inlet stickleback showed greater manoeuverability than did lake stickleback in some analyses. Morphology-performance relationships were decoupled when considering variation within vs. between populations. Moreover, morphology-performance mapping differed between the two populations. Based on these observations, we advance a hypothesis for why populations adapting to different environments should show adaptive genetic divergence in morphology-performance mapping.

AB Habitat change induced by organic enrichment is a growing concern for the sustainability of benthic communities in coastal aquatic environments. This case study describes the spatial and temporal response patterns and the recovery potential of low-diversity benthic communities to organic enrichment at two fish farm locations, during the rearing periods (15 and 20 years, respectively) and the following recovery periods (2 years). The spatial extent of disturbance differed depending on the hydromorphological characteristics of the rearing sites, but degraded macrobenthic communities close to both fish farms were recorded soon after the activity started. Continued organic enrichment resulted in high species turnover-rates and in an altered benthic community composition at both locations. After fish farm abatement, a partial recovery was detected in species richness, but abundance and biomass values were reduced and changes in structural composition remained. Alterations in benthic biological traits were observed at both fish farm locations, implying that organic enrichment might cause changes in benthic community function within low-diversity benthic communities.

AB Environmental variability is the main driver for the variation of biological characteristics (life-history traits) of species. Therefore, life-history traits are particularly suited to identify mechanistic linkages between environmental variability and species occurrence and can help in explaining ecological patterns. For ground beetles, few studies directly related species traits to environmental variables. This study aims to analyse how life-history traits of alluvial ground beetles are controlled by environmental factors. I expected that the occurrence of species and the occurrence of specific traits are closely related to hydrological and disturbance parameters. Furthermore I expected most of the trait-variation to be explained by a combination of environmental variables, rather than by their isolated effects. Ground beetles were sampled in the year 2005 in floodplain grassland along the Elbe River in Germany. I used redundancy analysis to quantify the effects of hydrological, sediment, and disturbance related parameters on both species occurrence and species traits. I applied variation partitioning to analyse which environmental compartments explain most of the trait variation. Species occurrence and trait variation were both mainly controlled by hydrological and flood disturbance parameters. I could clearly identify reproductive traits and body size as key traits for floodplain ground beetles to cope with the environmental variability. Furthermore, combinations of hydrological, habitat disturbance, habitat type, and species diversity parameters, rather than their isolated effects, explained large parts of ground beetle trait variation. Thus, a main conclusion of this study is that ground beetle occurrence is mainly determined by complex, multi-scale interactions between environmental variability and their life-history traits.

AB Using a combination of cultivation-dependent and -independent methods, this study aimed to elucidate the diversity of microorganisms involved in iron cycling and to resolve their in situ functional links in sediments of an acidic lignite mine lake. Using six different media with pH values ranging from 2.5 to 4.3, 117 isolates were obtained that grouped into 38 different strains, including 27 putative new species with respect to the closest characterized strains. Among the isolated strains, 22 strains were able to oxidize Fe(II), 34 were able to reduce Fe(III) in schwertmannite, the dominant iron oxide in this lake, and 21 could do both. All isolates falling into the Gammaproteobacteria (an unknown Dyella-like genus and Acidithiobacillus-related strains) were obtained from the top acidic sediment zones (pH 2.8). Firmicutes strains (related to Bacillus and Alicyclobacillus) were only isolated from deep, moderately acidic sediment zones (pH 4 to 5). Of the Alphaproteobacteria, Acidocella-related strains were only isolated from acidic zones, whereas Acidiphilium-related strains were isolated from all sediment depths. Bacterial clone libraries generally supported and complemented these patterns. Geobacter-related clone sequences were only obtained from deep sediment zones, and Geobacter-specific quantitative PCR yielded 8 X 10(5) gene copy numbers. Isolates related to the Acidobacterium, Acidocella, and Alicyclobacillus genera and to the unknown Dyella-like genus showed a broad pH tolerance, ranging from 2.5 to 5.0, and preferred schwertmannite to goethite for Fe(III) reduction. This study highlighted the variety of acidophilic microorganisms that are responsible for iron cycling in acidic environments, extending the results of recent laboratory-based studies that showed this trait to be widespread among acidophiles.

AB We tested whether the functional structures of Mediterranean and temperate western European fish communities responded similarly along environmental gradients. The species pools of the 2 regions were quite different, with few species common to both regions. Each species was assigned to 1 trait for each of 6 guilds considered. We aggregated occurrences or densities of the species sharing the same traits and then computed 26 metrics describing the functional structure of fish assemblages. For each metric, we fitted and then compared 3 nested models. The 1(st) model related the metric to environmental variables without taking into account the region. Therefore, the response was assumed to be the same between regions. The 2(nd) model related the metric to the environmental variables with the region as an additive parameter. Therefore, the response was assumed to be similar between regions but with a constant deviation between them. The 3(rd) model took into account all interactions between the environmental variables and region. Therefore, the response to the environmental gradient was assumed to be different in the 2 regions. For the 17 metrics finally tested, 11 metrics responded similarly to environmental gradients but generally showed a constant deviation between the 2 regions, and responses of 6 metrics differed between the regions. Our results highlight the roles played by biogeographical factors and the environment on current community structure in 2 neighboring but ecologically distinct regions.

AB Forecasting responses of benthic community structure and function to anthropogenic climate change is an emerging scientific challenge. Characterizing benthic species by biological attributes (traits) that are responsive to temperature and streamflow conditions can support a mechanistic approach for assessing the potential ecological responses to climate change. However, nonclimatic environmental factors also structure benthic communities and may mitigate transient climatic conditions, and these must be considered in evaluating potential impacts of climate change. Here we used macroinvertebrate and environmental data for 279 reference-quality sites spanning 12 states in the western US. For each sampling location, we described 45 environmental variables that spanned reach to catchment scales and that represented contemporary climate drivers, hydrologic metrics, and nonclimatic habitat features, as well as purely spatial metrics. We described benthic community composition at each site in terms of 7 species traits, including those considered sensitive to temperature increases and streamflow changes. All combined environmental variables explained 67% of the total trait variation across the sites, and catchment-scale climatic and hydrologic variables independently accounted for 19%. Sites were clustered into 3 community types based on trait composition, and a classification-tree analysis confirmed that climatic and hydrologic variables were important in partitioning these groups. Sensitivity of benthic communities to projected climate change was assessed by quantifying the proportion of taxa at sites having the traits of either cold stenothermy or obligate rheophily. Regression-tree analysis showed that temperature and hydrologic variables mostly accounted for the differences in proportion of sensitivity traits across the sites. We examined the vulnerability of sites to climate change by superimposing regional-scale projections of late-21(st)-century temperature and runoff change on the spatial distribution of temperature- and runoff-sensitive assemblages. Sites with high proportions of cold stenotherms and obligate rheophiles occur throughout the western US, but the degree of temperature and runoff change is projected to be greatest for reference sites in the Upper Colorado River and Great Basin. Thus, our results suggest that traits-based sensitivity coupled with intraregional variation in projected changes in temperature and runoff will cause reference sites in the western US to be differentially vulnerable to future climate change.

AB The delivery of environmental flows for biodiversity benefits within regulated river systems can potentially contribute to exotic weed spread. This study explores whether exotic plants of a floodplain forest in Victoria, Australia, are characterised by specific functional groups and associated plant traits linked to altering hydrological conditions over time. Permanently marked 20 x 20 m(2) plots from five wetland sites in Eucalyptus camaldulensis floodplain forest were sampled twice, first in the early 1990s (1993-1994) and then 15 years later (2007-2008). Species cover abundance data for understorey vegetation communities were segregated by season and analysed using ordination analysis. Exotic species richness was modelled as a function of site flooding history and native species richness using general linear models. Site ordinations by detrended correspondence analysis showed differential community compositions between survey dates, but native and exotic species were not clearly differentiated in terms of DCA1 scores. Most exotics belonged to functional groups containing annual species that germinate and reproduce under drier conditions. Exotics reproducing under wetter conditions were in the minority, predominantly perennial and capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. Site flooding history and native species richness significantly predicted exotic species richness. Vegetation changes are partially structured by reduced flood frequency favouring increased abundance of exotic, sexually reproducing annuals at drier sites. Sites of low flood frequency are more sensitive to future exotic weed invasion and will require targeted management effort. Flow restoration is predicted to benefit propagule dispersal of species adopting dual regeneration strategies, which are predominantly natives in this system.

AB Irrigation water withdrawals are ubiquitous in arid and semi-arid regions; however, predictable macroinvertebrate responses have not emerged. Inconsistent responses are frequently attributed to the amount of water withdrawn, while physicochemical and biological differences among systems remain unstudied. In this study, we sought to determine if species traits influence macroinvertebrate responses to water withdrawals. We sampled above and below 12 independent water diversions experiencing discharge reductions greater than 75% in central and eastern Oregon and Washington, USA. When considering all 12 rivers, we observed significant alterations to the hydrologic environment, in addition to increased algal standing stocks, silt cover and minimum temperatures; however, macroinvertebrate responses were limited to increased downstream densities, as indices and community composition did not significantly change. Functionally, species traits were more sensitive than structural indices; proportional abundance for 12 of 52 species traits significantly differed above and below all points of diversion. Trait changes suggest a shift in functional composition to compensate for hydrologic alterations and reduced habitat area. Grouping references sites (upstream) by species trait composition revealed a strong ambient gradient of increasing resistance and resilience from high to low elevations; however, we did not find evidence for differential susceptibility to water withdrawals among trait-based reference groups. Though water withdrawals changed the representation of select species traits, frequencies of trait states most vulnerable to water withdrawals were too homogenously distributed among sites to elicit differential responses among trait-based reference groups. At larger spatial scales or among disparate hydrologic regimes, grouping systems by species traits will likely reduce variability and offer a more general currency for detecting perturbation response relationships.

AB The higher mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere are particularly sensitive to climate change as small differences in temperature determine frozen ground status, precipitation phase, and the magnitude and timing of snow accumulation and melt. An international inter-catchment comparison program, North-Watch, seeks to improve our understanding of the sensitivity of northern catchments to climate change by examining their hydrological and biogeochemical responses. The catchments are located in Sweden (Krycklan), Scotland (Mharcaidh, Girnock and Strontian), the United States (Sleepers River, Hubbard Brook and HJ Andrews) and Canada (Catamaran, Dorset and Wolf Creek). This briefing presents the initial stage of the North-Watch program, which focuses on how these catchments collect, store and release water and identify 'types' of hydro-climatic catchment response. At most sites, a 10-year data of daily precipitation, discharge and temperature were compiled and evaporation and storage were calculated. Inter-annual and seasonal patterns of hydrological processes were assessed via normalized fluxes and standard flow metrics. At the annual-scale, relations between temperature, precipitation and discharge were compared, highlighting the role of seasonality, wetness and snow/frozen ground. The seasonal pattern and synchronicity of fluxes at the monthly scale provided insight into system memory and the role of storage. We identified types of catchments that rapidly translate precipitation into runoff and others that more readily store water for delayed release. Synchronicity and variance of rainfall-runoff patterns were characterized by the coefficient of variation (cv) of monthly fluxes and correlation coefficients. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed clustering among like catchments in terms of functioning, largely controlled by two components that (i) reflect temperature and precipitation gradients and the correlation of monthly precipitation and discharge and (ii) the seasonality of precipitation and storage. By advancing the ecological concepts of resistance and resilience for catchment functioning, results provided a conceptual framework for understanding susceptibility to hydrological change across northern catchments.

AB Increasing levels of environmental stress due to global warming and eutrophication, and concerns about an unparalleled global diversity loss, have triggered new interest in the question whether the stability of ecosystem properties depends on population dynamics of dominant species or on compensatory growth of rare species. Recent meta-analyses suggest that compensatory dynamics are rare in natural systems. Experimental results, however, indicate that the interdependence of stressor regime, species traits, and species richness determines which mechanisms stabilise communities. Stability will depend on population dynamics of dominant species, if they remain the best performers regardless of disturbance. If dominant species become rare or lost, compensatory growth of rare species will insure natural communities against complete failure. Salinity is an important stressor governing growth and distribution of phytoplankton in brackish ecosystems, and its impact on coastal aquatic ecosystems is likely to change due to global warming. We performed two short-term experiments to investigate the effects of salinity stress on community structure and biomass production of natural phytoplankton communities collected in tidally influenced and polymictic Lake Waihola (New Zealand). The lake was brackish when the inoculum for the first experiment was collected. The inoculum for the second experiment originated from a fresh water situation. In both experiments, the phytoplankton assemblage was exposed to a salinity gradient ranging from 0 to 5. To assess the importance of dominance and compensatory growth, we determined biomass production, species richness, diversity, evenness and dominance indices, and species specific growth rates. Biomass production in our experiments was determined by dominant species. Anabaena flos-aquae dominated in the first experiment, and Asterionella formosa in the second experiment. Despite the importance of these species, we found significant growth responses of rare and abundant species. Even if these species showed high growth rates, biomass production was carried by the dominant species as long as the salinity level allowed them to grow. When the salinity level was detrimental to the growth of the dominant species, reduced dominance and increased diversity indices emphasised the importance of compensatory growth of rare species. The salinity stress applied in our experiments was strong enough to change the hierarchy of successful functional traits, which affected community structure and biomass production of the plankton communities. If the predicted sea water rise, increasing frequency of storm tides, rising water temperatures, and altered precipitation and run-off cause the salinity of coastal aquatic ecosystems to change, major changes in community composition, diversity and dominance structure of planktonic primary producers might be expected.

AB The successful use of macroinvertebrates as indicators of stream condition in bioassessments has led to heightened interest throughout the scientific community in the prediction of stream condition. For example, predictive models are increasingly being developed that use measures of watershed disturbance, including urban and agricultural land-use, as explanatory variables to predict various metrics of biological condition such as richness, tolerance, percent predators, index of biotic integrity, functional species traits, or even ordination axes scores. Our primary intent was to determine if effective models could be developed using watershed characteristics of disturbance to predict macroinvertebrate metrics among disparate and widely separated ecoregions. We aggregated macroinvertebrate data from universities and state and federal agencies in order to assemble stream data sets of high enough density appropriate for modeling in three distinct ecoregions in Oregon and California. Extensive review and quality assurance of macroinvertebrate sampling protocols, laboratory subsample counts and taxonomic resolution was completed to assure data comparability. We used widely available digital coverages of land-use and land-cover data summarized at the watershed and riparian scale as explanatory variables to predict macroinvertebrate metrics commonly used by state resource managers to assess stream condition. The "best" multiple linear regression models from each region required only two or three explanatory variables to model macroinvertebrate metrics and explained 41-74% of the variation. In each region the best model contained some measure of urban and/or agricultural land-use, yet often the model was improved by including a natural explanatory variable such as mean annual precipitation or mean watershed slope. Two macroinvertebrate metrics were common among all three regions, the metric that summarizes the richness of tolerant macroinvertebrates (RICHTOL) and some form of Err (Ephemeroptera. Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) richness. Best models were developed for the same two invertebrate metrics even though the geographic regions reflect distinct differences in precipitation, geology, elevation, slope, population density, and land-use. With further development, models like these call be used to elicit better causal linkages to stream biological attributes or condition and call be used by researchers or managers to predict biological indicators of stream condition at unsampled sites.

AB Phytoremediation potential has been widely accepted as highly stable and dynamic approach for reducing eco-toxic pollutants. Earlier reports endorse remediation abilities both in herbaceous plants as well as woody trees. Poplars are dominant trees to the ecosystem structure and functioning in riparian forests of North America Rivers and also to other part of the world. Understanding of the fact that how genetic variation in primary producer structures communities, affects species distribution, and alters ecosystem-level processes, attention was paid to investigate the perspectives of genetic modification in poplar. The present review article furnishes documented evidences for genetic engineering of Populus tree for enhanced phytoremediation abilities. The versatility of poplar as a consequence of its distinct traits, rapid growth rates, extensive root system, high perennial biomass production, and immense industrial value, bring it in the forefront of phytoremediation. Furthermore, remediative capabilities of Populus can be significantly increased by introducing cross-kingdom, non-resident genes encoding desirable traits. Available genome sequence database of Populus contribute to the determination of gene functions together with elucidating phytoremediation linked metabolic pathways. Adequate understanding of functional genomics in merger with physiology and genetics of poplar offers distinct advantage in identifying and upgrading phytoremediation potential of this model forest tree species for human welfare.

ID PERSONALITY-DISORDER
AB Ludwig II of Bavaria (Germany) entered the political stage at the age of 18, following the premature death of his father Maximilian II in 1864. At that time, Ludwig was a very handsome, slender young man; he was enthusiastic and had a pronounced taste for fine arts and music, and was admired by the people as a "fairy tale king". However, already during the first years of his reign, he displayed traits that fulfilled the ICD-10 criteria for schizotypal disorder together with a combined cluster B personality disorder. They became even more pronounced over time. Towards the end of his life, Ludwig developed "imperial madness", a typical pattern of behavioural excesses including craving for power, splendour, construction, unrestrained spending, excessive eating and sexual exploitation, revenge with a tendency for cruelty, and an inclination for theatrical and sometimes irrational acts. This complex syndrome is usually manifested in excessively egocentric rulers who have almost unlimited power or, in the case of Ludwig II, an overwhelming desire to possess it. His imperial madness was possibly contributed to by an orbitofrontal brain syndrome. One conjecture is that this condition reflected a neurodegenerative process; another is that a primary deficit, initiated by brain damage following a severe bout of meningitis during Ludwig's babyhood, played a role. In this case, functional compensation by other brain areas may have eventually been counteracted by chronic substance abuse in his thirties. The monarch's life ended tragically when he was 40 by which time he had become adipose and had lost most of his teeth; meanwhile, he was placed under tutelage, dismissed and detained. Before his death by drowning in Lake Starnberg (suicide? attempted escape??), Ludwig apparently killed his psychiatrist, Bernhard von Gudden, who carelessly served as his sole attendant. Yet Ludwig's image as the beautiful fairy tale king is still alive in the hearts of successive generations of Bavarians and in the fascination demonstrated by the masses of tourists from throughout the world who visit (against his formerly declared wishes) his "dream castles".

AB In semi-arid regions, a major population limitation for riparian trees is seedling desiccation during the dry season that follows annual spring floods. We investigated the stress response of first-year pioneer riparian seedlings to experimental water table declines (0, 1 and 3 cm day(-1)), focusing on the three dominant cottonwood and willows (family Salicaceae) in California's San Joaquin Basin. We analyzed growth and belowground allocation response to water stress, and used logistic regression to determine if these traits had an influence on individual survival. The models indicate that high root growth (> 3 mm day(-1)) and low shoot:root ratios (< 1.5 g g(-1)) strongly predicted survival, but there was no evidence that plants increased belowground allocation in response to drawdown. Leaf delta C-13 values shifted most for the best-surviving species (net change of +3.5 per mil from -30.0 +/- A 0.3 control values for Goodding's willow, Salix gooddingii), implying an important role of increased water-use efficiency for surviving water stress. Both S. gooddingii and sandbar willow (S. exigua) reduced leaf size from controls, whereas Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) sustained a 29% reduction in specific leaf area (from 13.4 to 9.6 m(2) kg(-1)). The functional responses exhibited by Goodding's willow, the more drought-tolerant species, may play a role in its greater relative abundance in dry regions such as the San Joaquin Basin. This study highlights the potential for a shift in riparian forest composition. Under a future drier climate regime or under reduced regulated river flows, our results suggest that willow establishment will be favored over cottonwood.

AB In applied river ecology it is implicitly assumed that community structure is a surrogate for functional properties. To test this hypothesis, 26 sites were sampled for macroinvertebrates in a Central Italian stream system impacted by 13 trout farms (1 upstream and 1 downstream site per facility). We used a fuzzy-coding approach of biological traits combined with species distribution analysis. Trout farm locally impacted the structure of macroinvertebrate communities, but serial disturbances at the stream system scale did not affect the overall regional diversity pattern.
   Impacted sites had species with large body size, which fed upon microorganisms and fine detritus, and which showed asexual reproduction. Least impact sites hosted small-sized invertebrates showing sexual reproduction, and feeding upon plant material and/or algae.

AB Large-statured invasive grasses (LSIGs) constitute a distinct functional group with characteristic life history traits that facilitate colonization and aggressive growth in aquatic ecosystems, particularly those modified by human activities. These species typically form monocultures in the systems they invade and have wide-ranging and negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem processes. In March 2008, a special symposium was held as part of the Western Society of Weed Scientists annual meeting to synthesize our current knowledge of the ecological impacts and management of two notorious LSIGs: Arundo donax and Phragmites australis. In this volume of Invasive Plant Science and Management, symposium participants provide articles summarizing existing knowledge, recent research progress, and research needs for these two taxa. Here, we summarize the basic biology of these species and suggest the use of a more holistic approach to deal with the effects and management of LSIG invasions.

AB Multiple cues, across multiple sensory modalities, are involved in mate choice in a wide range of animal taxa. This multiplicity leads to the prediction that, in adaptive radiations, sexual isolation results from divergence in multiple dimensions. However, difficulties in directly measuring preferences and detecting multiple effects limit our ability to empirically assess the number of independent traits contributing to mate choice and sexual isolation. We present an approach to estimate the dimensionality of sexual isolation using mating trials across groups of related populations. We analyze nine radiations: seven in fruit flies (Drosophila) and one each in salamanders (Desmognathus) and cichlid fishes (Pseudotropheus). We find strong evidence that multiple latent traits-linear combinations of phenotypic traits and preferences-are responsible for the patterns of sexual isolation in all nine radiations but that dimensionality has a strong upper limit. Just two latent traits are implicated in the majority of cases. Mapping along latent trait axes tests predictions of sexual-selection models and allows correlation with specific phenotypic traits and functional components of mate choice. We find support for the role of stabilizing natural selection on the sexually selected (male) traits. In the cichlids, latent-trait axes incorporate male-coloration patterns and exhibit convergence as well as divergence among populations. In the salamanders, temporal patterning in sensory modalities and male vs. female preferences are reflected in different latent-trait axes.

AB Ecosystem assessment and monitoring requires the development and application of suitable indicators, i.e. they need to be (i) reliable and capable of simplifying complex relationships, (ii) quantifiable and transparent in order to enable an easy communication, and (iii) fit for the purpose of indication. These requirements are scarcely fulfilled in current ecosystem assessment and monitoring efforts to address the requirements of international biodiversity conventions. Here we present and test a set of seven criteria towards an improved framework for ecosystems indication with particular emphasis on the indication of biodiversity and ecosystem services: purpose of indication, indicator type according to the EEA's Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response scheme, direct/indirect linkages to biodiversity and ecosystem services, spatial scale and scalability across scales, applicability of benchmarks/reference values, availability of data and protocols, and applicability of remote sensing. The criteria are tested using 24 indicators of ecosystem assessment and monitoring at the global, continental and regional scale. Based on the general trends revealed by our evaluation, we present recommendations to streamline and improve ecosystem indication with respect to international biodiversity conventions. The implementation of our recommendations does require concerted international effort, comparable, for instance, to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Europe.

AB Rigorous and widely applicable indicators of biodiversity are needed to monitor the responses of ecosystems to global change and design effective conservation schemes. Among the potential indicators of biodiversity, those based on the functional traits of species and communities are interesting because they can be generalized to similar habitats and can be assessed by relatively rapid field assessment across eco-regions. Functional traits, however, have as yet been rarely considered in current common monitoring schemes. Moreover, standardized procedures of trait measurement and analyses have almost exclusively been developed for plants but different approaches have been used for different groups of organisms. Here we review approaches using functional traits as biodiversity indicators focussing not on plants as usual but particularly on animal groups that are commonly considered in different biodiversity monitoring schemes (benthic invertebrates, collembolans, above ground insects and birds). Further, we introduce a new framework based on functional traits indices and illustrate it using case studies where the traits of these organisms can help monitoring the response of biodiversity to different land use change drivers. We propose and test standard procedures to integrate different components of functional traits into biodiversity monitoring schemes across trophic levels and disciplines. We suggest that the development of indicators using functional traits could complement, rather than replace, the existent biodiversity monitoring. In this way, the comparison of the effect of land use changes on biodiversity is facilitated and is expected to positively influence conservation management practices.

AB While compositional diversity is a common metric for assessing human impacts on aquatic communities, functional diversity is scarcely employed, though highly desirable from the perspective of the European Water Framework Directive. Using abundance data from 99 minimally disturbed sites (i.e., no or very weak anthropogenic impact) from a national survey, we studied the spatial variability of compositional and functional biodiversity metrics across a predefined ecoregional classification. Metrics of compositional diversity comprised taxonomic and EPT richness and Simpson diversity. Functional diversity metrics were based on Rao's Quadratic Entropy (RQE), which described the differences among benthic invertebrate genera in eleven biological traits (e.g., size, life cycle, reproduction types, feeding habits). Using generalized linear models we show that taxonomic richness may vary greatly across ecoregions, contrasting with Simpson diversity and functional metrics that varied weakly in response to natural environmental variability. Functional diversity metrics, because of their stability in response to natural environmental variability, may be useful tools for assessing human impairment to ecosystem function. We further tested the response of functional diversity metrics to a specific human impact (sewage) and demonstrated significant modifications of functional diversity downstream of sewage pollution. Further investigations are required to test the ability of functional diversity metrics to precisely and accurately indicate different types of human impacts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Freshwater fish diversity is shaped by phylogenetic constraints acting on related taxa and biogeographic constraints operating on regional species pools. In the present study, we use a trait-based approach to examine taxonomic and biogeographic patterns of life history diversity of freshwater fishes in North America (exclusive of Mexico). Multivariate analysis revealed strong support for a tri-lateral continuum model with three end-point strategies defining the equilibrium (low fecundity, high juvenile survivorship), opportunistic (early maturation, low juvenile survivorship), and periodic (late maturation, high fecundity, low juvenile survivorship) life histories. Trait composition and diversity varied greatly between and within major families. Finally, we used occurrence data for large watersheds (n = 350) throughout the United States and Canada to examine geographic patterns of life history variation. Distinct patterns of life history strategies were discernible and deemed congruent with biogeographic processes and selection pressures acting on life history strategies of freshwater fishes throughout North America.

AB Disruptive natural selection on traits related to resource exploitation may lead to differential adaptation and finally to speciation. Trait utility, the performance of traits in terms of fitness, is a central criterion for the recognition of adaptive radiation. Utility of morphological structures involved in foraging can be detected by relating their variation to individual resource use. Here, we test for trophic adaptations in the radiation of "sharpfin" sailfin silversides (Atheriniformes: Telmatherinidae), endemic to ancient graben-lake Matano in central Sulawesi (Indonesia). This small species-flock is characterized by high phenotypic diversity, including traits most likely related to feeding ecology. Previous analyses suggest that species boundaries are porous, indicating very recent or possibly ongoing processes of species flock formation. To test for adaptation to resource use in this radiation, we compared morphological traits among trophic groups of individuals as identified by stomach content analyses. We analyzed variation in candidate structures or structural complexes commonly recognized as indicative of trophic adaptation in fish radiations, including shapes of body, oral and pharyngeal jaws, gill rakers and body size. We found fine-scaled morphological differentiation according to feeding habits, covering all traits analyzed. Fish-, shrimp- and egg-feeders were most distinct, with major axes of morphological variation fitting patterns of adaptation reported from other lacustrine fish radiations. Thus, the present results are consistent with fine-scaled morphological adaptation to resource use, supporting the adaptive character of the sharpfin sailfin silverside radiation.

AB P>1. Intraguild predation is widespread in nature despite its potentially destabilizing effect on food web dynamics.
   2. Anti-predator inducible defences affect both birth and death rates of populations and have the potential to substantially modify food web dynamics and possibly increase persistence of intaguild prey.
   3. In a chemostat experiment, we investigated the long-term effects of inducible defences on the dynamics of aquatic microbial food webs consisting of an intraguild predator, intraguild prey, and a basal resource. We controlled environmental conditions and selected strains of intraguild prey that varied in the strength of expressed inducible defences.
   4. We found that intraguild prey with a stronger tendency to induce an anti-predator morphology persist for significantly longer periods of time. In addition, model selection analysis implied that flexibility in defensive phenotype (inducibility itself) is most likely the factor responsible for the enhanced persistence.
   5. As patterns at the community level often emerge as a result of the life-history traits of individuals, we propose that inducible defences increase the persistence of populations and may contribute to the widespread occurrence of theoretically unstable intraguild predation systems in nature.

AB We investigated the potential of plant functional responses to speed up restoration in a postfire ecosystem. The patterns of change in plant nutrient uptake and water potential after compost amendment were monitored for 2 years in a 7-year-old postfire shrubland in southeastern France. We studied four different stress-tolerant species with contrasting life traits: three shrub species and a perennial herb. Three treatments were applied: control, 50 and 100 Mg/ha of fresh cocomposted sewage sludge and green waste. In both compost treatments, concentrations of all the macronutrients increased. The amendment improved N and cation nutrition, but the positive effect of compost on plant nutrient status was most apparent on leaf P concentrations, indicating that P was a limiting nutrient in this shrubland. Compost had no significant short-term effect on trace metal concentrations in plants. The plant nutrition response of different species to the compost varied; the nutritional status of Brachypodium retusum and Cistus albidus improved the most, whereas that of Quercus coccifera and Ulex parviflorus improved the least. Woody species exhibited no increase in N stocks. Phosphorus accumulation was also about three times higher in plots amended at 50 Mg/ha than in control plots for B. retusum and C. albidus. The severe summer drought of 2003 altered the compost effect. Contrary to our expectations, plants on amended plots did not exhibit a better water status in summer: the effect of the summer drought had a greater effect on water status than did the compost treatment.

AB Crayfishes are both a highly imperiled invertebrate group as well as one that has produced many invasive species, which have negatively affected freshwater ecosystems throughout the world. We performed a trait analysis for 77 crayfishes from the southeastern United States in an attempt to understand which biological and ecological traits make these species prone to imperilment or invasion, and to predict which species may face extinction or become invasive in the future. We evaluated biological and ecological traits with principal coordinate analysis and classification trees. Invasive and imperiled crayfishes occupied different positions in multivariate trait space, although crayfishes invasive at different scales (extraregional vs. extralimital) were also distinct. Extraregional crayfishes (large, high fecundity, habitat generalists) were most distinct from imperiled crayfishes (small, low fecundity, habitat specialists), thus supporting the "two sides of the same coin" hypothesis. Correct classification rates for assignment of crayfishes as invasive or imperiled were high (70-80%), even when excluding the highly predictive but potentially confounding trait of range size (75-90%). We identified a number of species that, although not currently listed as imperiled or found outside their native range, possess many of the life-history and ecological traits characteristic of currently invasive or imperiled taxa. Such species exhibit a high latent risk of extinction or invasion and consequently should be the focus of proactive conservation or management strategies. Our results illustrate the utility of trait-based approaches for taxonomic groups such as invertebrates, for which detailed species-specific data are rare and conservation resources are chronically limited.

AB P>1. Recent work has emphasised the benefit of using functional measures when relating biodiversity to ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigated the extent to which functional and taxonomic diversity might be related to summed biovolume in community assemblages of 212 species of diatoms collected from 65 temperate lakes in western and central Quebec, Canada.
   2. We quantified functional diversity as both the total path-length of a functional dendrogram (FD) and the variance in species traits (TV) for a given community. Selected traits included both size and responses to a set of environmental variables known to be influential for diatom communities.
   3. Species richness, as well as both FD and TV, was positively associated with total diatom biovolume at the level of the entire diatom community, suggesting that diversity in response types (particularly to total phosphorus and pH) is important for diatom community production.
   4. Although functional measures of diversity did not provide enhanced explanatory power over species richness, we argue that an exploration of functional traits potentially allows greater insight into the mechanisms underlying biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relations, indicating which traits might be most influential in driving community biomass production.

AB P>1. The extent to which seedling recruitment contributes to local functional diversity depends on the environmental filters operating in a plant community. Classical community assembly models assume that habitat constraints and competition act like hierarchical filters with habitat filtering as the dominant one. Alternative models assume a synergic interaction since responses to environmental stress and competition may impose physiological trade-offs in plants.
   2. River floodplains are an ideal system to test the relationship between habitat and competition filtering in community (re)assembly, as flooding causes changes in both habitat stress (waterlogging, resulting in anoxia and toxicity) and competition (dieback of vegetation) on one hand and acts as an effective seed dispersal vector on the other hand.
   3. We conducted a mesocosm experiment on early community assembly from a pool of 34 floodplain species covering a wetness gradient. Seed mixtures were sown in a full factorial design with water level, canopy and mowing as controlling factors. We measured the biomass of all species after one growing season and determined germination and seedling growth traits, both outside (response to waterlogging/no waterlogging) and in a growth-chamber (response to light/darkness).
   4. Species recruitment was analysed in relation to the controlling factors and measured functional traits using co-inertia analysis. Furthermore we analysed the effects of the controlling factors on several aspects of functional diversity.
   5. There was no establishment in grass sward, unless mowing was applied. Species-rich communities only developed when germination and early establishment phases occurred on waterlogged bare soil. High water level did not suppress establishment but reduced the total biomass and lowered inter-specific competition. The effect of mowing on species richness depended upon the interplay between waterlogging and canopy.
   6. Establishment success under canopy required seedling strategies to tolerate shade. The elimination of typical wetland specialists from oxic mesocosms was clearly an effect of their poorer and/or slower germination and lower competitive abilities in comparison to non-wetland plants, leading to their disappearance in this low-stress environment.
   7. Our results indicate that single stress factors can enhance species richness and functional diversity through limiting competition but a synergic interaction of different stresses can lead to reduced richness.

AB The three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus is a model species for studying questions in ecology and evolution. The rapid diversification of G. aculeatus in post-glacial freshwater environments, combined with recently developed molecular tools, provides a unique opportunity to study the functional basis of fitness variation in natural populations. In derived freshwater populations, a number of morphological traits have diverged in parallel from the marine ancestral state, including the number of lateral armour plates. Evolution of reduced armour in freshwater populations is due to positive selection from both abiotic and biotic mechanisms. The major effect gene (ectodysplasin-A or Eda), along with several minor effect genetic regions, has recently been shown to control lateral plate variation. Field experiments have further determined the fitness consequences of allelic variation at the major effect locus. This work helps elucidate the mechanisms connecting genetic variation with phenotypic variation and fitness in the wild, a synthesis that should be applicable to many other phenotypic traits and species of fishes.

AB Background: Denitrification is an important ecosystem service that removes nitrogen (N) from N-polluted watersheds, buffering soil, stream, and river water quality from excess N by returning N to the atmosphere before it reaches lakes or oceans and leads to eutrophication. The denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) assay is widely used for measuring denitrification potential. Because DEA is a function of enzyme levels in soils, most ecologists studying denitrification have assumed that DEA is less sensitive to ambient levels of nitrate (NO(3)(-)) and soil carbon and thus, less variable over time than field measurements. In addition, plant diversity has been shown to have strong effects on microbial communities and belowground processes and could potentially alter the functional capacity of denitrifiers. Here, we examined three questions: (1) Does DEA vary through the growing season? (2) If so, can we predict DEA variability with environmental variables? (3) Does plant functional diversity affect DEA variability?
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The study site is a restored wetland in North Carolina, US with native wetland herbs planted in monocultures or mixes of four or eight species. We found that denitrification potentials for soils collected in July 2006 were significantly greater than for soils collected in May and late August 2006 (p<0.0001). Similarly, microbial biomass standardized DEA rates were significantly greater in July than May and August (p<0.0001). Of the soil variables measured soil moisture, organic matter, total inorganic nitrogen, and microbial biomass-none consistently explained the pattern observed in DEA through time. There was no significant relationship between DEA and plant species richness or functional diversity. However, the seasonal variance in microbial biomass standardized DEA rates was significantly inversely related to plant species functional diversity (p<0.01).
   Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that higher plant functional diversity may support a more constant level of DEA through time, buffering the ecosystem from changes in season and soil conditions.

AB A procedure to select the most relevant metrics for assessing the ecological condition of the Douro basin (north Portugal) was developed based upon a set of 184 benthic community metrics. They were grouped into 16 biological categories selected from literature using data collected over 2 years from 54 sites along 31 rivers covering the whole perceived range of human disturbance. Multivariate analyses were carried out to identify the main trends in the macroinvertebrate data, to select reference versus impaired sites, to avoid multicolinearity between metrics, and to identify those that were clearly independent from natural stream typology. Structural metrics, adaptation metrics, and tolerance measures most effectively responded across a range of human influence. We find these attributes to be ecologically sound for monitoring Portugal's lotic ecosystems and providing information relevant to the Water Framework Directive, which asserts that the definition of water quality depends on its "ecological status", independent of the actual or potential uses of those waters.

AB P>1. The use of species traits to interpret biological changes in invertebrate assemblages across environmental gradients has been suggested as a method to improve discrimination over existing species composition methods. One reason for greater potential discrimination and predictive ability is the assumed universality of traits across a range of spatial and temporal scales. We explore this assumption by comparing the consistency of stressor-response relationships of a trait characteristic (percent clinging taxa) and a common taxonomy-based metric [percent Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT)] over a stressor gradient of increasing benthic fine sediment.
   2. We use invertebrate assemblage and environmental data from three large-scale surveys that cover the western United States, eastern United States and the Mid-Atlantic Highlands of the US. These three datasets allow us to compare stressor-response relationships in terms of geographic position (west versus east) and spatial scale (entire east versus a sub-region of the east). We compare the slopes and intercepts of the two measures of assemblage response.
   3. Trait characteristics exhibited more consistent stressor-response relationships than identity characteristics. Stressor-response relationships generated for clinging invertebrate richness had statistically similar slopes over sediment gradients, regardless of spatial scale or geographic location. In contrast, slopes were significantly different for relationships generated with EPT richness over sediment gradients.
   4. Results of this study support the hypothesis that trait-based measures have a more consistent response to a stressor gradient than identity-based assemblage measures. Choosing consistent measures of community response will facilitate comparisons among assemblages across large spatial scales.

A toxic quality class (from 'high' to 'poor/bad') was pre-assigned to each site using the French water quality assessment system (SEQ-Eau) based on toxic substances (metals, PAH and PCB) in sediment.
   3. Each trait was described in multiple categories. The affinity of macroinvertebrate taxa for the different categories of a trait was described using a fuzzy coding procedure. The relative abundance of trait categories was calculated for communities at each site.
   4. A nonparametric multiple comparison statistical procedure was used to compare relative abundances of trait categories between groups of sites assigned to different quality classes (e.g. high versus good; good versus moderate, etc.), to identify the combinations of trait categories that best separated sites between adjacent toxic quality classes. Based on such sets of trait categories, we propose a statistical procedure to allocate sites to toxic quality classes from the attributes of its benthic macroinvertebrate community.
   5. Predictions from the trait-based functional tool achieved approximately 73% of correct site post-assignments to toxic quality classes pre-assigned using chemical criteria. All of the sites pre-assigned to the 'high' quality class, were post-classified into the same quality class using benthic community attributes. From 0-90% of sites from other quality classes were classified identically using both chemistry- and trait-based criteria, the observed biological impact being often lower than expected. We suggest that the rapid decline of sensitive species could lead to both low taxonomic richness and low diversity of adaptations, giving communities a less diverse range of potential functional responses to increasing toxic pressure.
   6. Biological criteria based on macroinvertebrate traits could provide new methods for biological assessment. This study is the first step towards an in situ functional tool of stream sediment contamination assessment at community level. However, we need to increase the number of sites included in the development data set to improve the tool's precision, extend the procedure to additional stream types and validate the design at a larger spatial scale.

AB As global climate change affects recharge and runoff processes, stream flow regimes are being altered. In the American Southwest, increasing aridity is predicted to cause declines in stream base flows and water tables. Another potential outcome of climate change is increased flood intensity. Changes in these stream flow conditions may independently affect vegetation or may have synergistic effects. Our goal was to extrapolate vegetation response to climate-linked stream flow changes, by taking advantage of the spatial variation in flow conditions over a 200 km length of the San Pedro River (Arizona). Riparian vegetation traits were contrasted between sites differing in low-flow hydrology (degree of stream intermittency) and flood intensity (stream power of the 10-year recurrence flood). Field data indicate that increased stream intermittency would cause the floodplain plant community to shift from hydric pioneer trees and shrubs (Populus, Salix, Baccharis) towards mesic species (Tamarix). This shift in functional type would produce changes in vegetation structure, with reduced canopy cover and shorter canopies at drier sites. Among herbaceous species, annuals would increase while perennials would decrease. If flood intensities increased, there would be shifts towards younger tree age, expansion of xeric pioneer shrubs (in response to flood-linked edaphic changes), and replacement of herbaceous perennials by annuals. Woody stem density would increase and basal area would decrease, reflecting shifts towards younger forests. Some effects would be compounded: Annuals were most prevalent, and tree canopies shortest, at sites that were dry and intensely flooded. Vegetational changes would feedback onto hydrologic and geomorphic processes, of importance for modeling. Increased flood intensity would have positive feedback on disturbance processes, by shifting plant communities towards species with less ability to stabilize sediments. Feedbacks between riparian vegetation and stream low-flow changes would be homeostatic, with reduced evapotranspiration rates ameliorating declines in base flows arising from increased aridity.

AB A mass-balance trophic model was built to describe the food-web traits of the North Aegean Sea (Strymonikos Gulf and Thracian Sea, Greece, Eastern Mediterranean) during the mid-2000s and to explore the impacts of fishing. This is the first food-web model representing the Aegean Sea, and results were presented and discussed in comparison to other previous ecosystems modelled from the western and the central areas of the basin (South Catalan and North-Central Adriatic Seas). Forty functional groups were defined, covering the entire trophic spectrum from lower to higher trophic levels. Emphasis was placed on commercial invertebrates and fish. The potential ecological role of the invasive ctenophore, Mnerniopsis leidyi, and several vulnerable groups (e.g., dolphins) was also explored. Results confirmed the spatial productivity patterns known for the Mediterranean Sea showing, for example, that the total biomass is highest in N.C. Adriatic and lowest in N. Aegean Sea. Accordingly, food-web flows and several ecosystem indicators like the mean transfer efficiency were influenced by these patterns. Nevertheless, all three systems shared some common features evidencing similarities of Mediterranean Sea ecosystems such as dominance of the pelagic fraction in terms of flows and strong benthic pelagic coupling of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates through detritus. The importance of detritus highlighted the role of the microbial food-web, which was indirectly considered through detritus dynamics. Ciliates, mesozooplankton and several benthic invertebrate groups were shown as important elements of the ecosystem linking primary producers and detritus with higher trophic levels in the N. Aegean Sea. Adult anchovy was shown as the most important fish group in terms of production, consumption and overall effect on the rest of the ecological groups in the model, in line with results from the Western Mediterranean Sea. The five fishing fleets considered (both artisanal and industrial) had high impacts on vulnerable species and numerous targeted groups given the multispecies nature of the fisheries in the N. Aegean Sea. Several exploitation indices highlighted that the N. Aegean Sea ecosystem was highly exploited and unlikely to be sustainably fished, similarly to other Mediterranean marine ecosystems.

AB The individual functional traits of different species play a key role for ecosystem function in aquatic and terrestrial systems. We modeled a multispecies predator-prey system with functionally different predator and prey species based on observations of the community dynamics of ciliates and their algal prey in Lake Constance. The model accounted for differences in predator feeding preferences and prey susceptibility to predation, and for the respective trade-offs. A low food demand of the predator was connected to a high food selectivity, and a high growth rate of the prey was connected to a high vulnerability to grazing. The data and the model did not show standard uniform predator-prey cycles, but revealed both complex dynamics and a coexistence of predator and prey at high biomass levels. These dynamics resulted from internally driven alternations in species densities and involved compensatory dynamics between functionally different species. Functional diversity allowed for ongoing adaptation of the predator and prey communities to changing environmental conditions such as food composition and grazing pressure. The trade-offs determined whether compensatory or synchronous dynamics occurred which influence the variability at the community level. Compensatory dynamics were promoted by a joint carrying capacity linking the different prey species which is particularly relevant at high prey biomasses, i.e., when grazers are less efficient. In contrast, synchronization was enhanced by the coupling of the different predator and prey species via common feeding links, e.g., by a high grazing pressure of a nonselective predator. The communities had to be functionally diverse in terms of their trade-offs and their traits to yield compensatory dynamics. Rather similar predator species tended to cycle synchronously, whereas profoundly different species did not coexist. Compensatory dynamics at the community level thus required intermediately strong tradeoffs for functional traits in both predators and their prey.

AB P>1. Our objective was to investigate the associations between benthic macro-invertebrate communities and environmental factors described at three spatial scales: local, reach and catchment. Differences in these associations, because of local topography, were determined by categorising sites into those having a large or small 'reach contributing area' (RCA), which is the lateral area of land contributing surface and subsurface flow of water, nutrients, organic and inorganic materials to a stream reach independent of catchment size and upstream contributions, and created by local topography.
   2. Twenty-three sites were sampled in the Lake Nipigon Forest in north-western Ontario. Local variables included hydrological metrics and stream morphology characteristics. Terrestrial reach and catchment variables included forest characteristics, topography and geomorphology. Invertebrates were identified and classified into functional feeding guilds. Canonical correspondence analysis and redundancy analysis were used to determine which variables contributed most to macro-invertebrate community structure and how the RCA influenced those associations.
   3. Overall, local-scale variables explained most variation in taxonomic and functional community structure (51.6 and 59.1%). Catchment-scale variables explained more variation in the community (43.9 and 43.5%) than reach-scale variables. In sites with a large RCA, the reach-scale variables accounted for almost 10% more variability in taxonomic structure than the catchment-scale variables, and in sites with a small RCA, catchment-scale variables explained almost 23% more variation in feeding guild structure than reach-scale variables.
   4. Topography was important at both the reach and the catchment scales. Variables at the reach scale most associated with invertebrate community tended to be related to forest cover, whereas important variables at the catchment scale were related to topography, wetlands and lakes.
   5. The difference in associations between invertebrate communities and environmental factors based on RCA indicates the influence of local topography on the linkage between aquatic habitats and the surrounding terrestrial environment. Understanding how these linkages affect aquatic communities can help to develop more effective predictive models of invertebrate community and more prescriptive conservation and management strategies for small streams.

AB P>1. Patterns in phytoplankton diversity in lakes and their relationships with environmental gradients have been traditionally based on taxonomic analyses and indices, even though measures of functional diversity (FD) might be expected to be more responsive to such gradients.
   2. We assessed the influence of water column physical structure, and other components of the overall environment, on lake phytoplankton diversity using two taxonomically based indices [species richness (S) and the Shannon index (H')] and a FD index, to determine whether these different measures respond in similar ways to habitat structure. The study encompassed 45 lakes in Eastern Canada, within two lake districts [the Eastern Townships Region (ETR) and Laurentians Region (LR)] that vary in geology and landscape and in lake morphometry and chemistry.
   3. Across all lakes, S and H' were higher in lakes having greater vertical temperature heterogeneity and higher susceptibility to wind mixing. In addition, H' declined with total phosphorus concentration. FD was only related to maximum lake depth, a variable that integrates many other habitat features.
   4. Further insight into the factors affecting phytoplankton diversity was obtained by contrasting the two regions. The taxonomically based diversity measures differed little between the regions, while FD was higher in the ETR where more trait variants were present and more evenly distributed amongst species. Whereas factors driving S did not differ between the regions, we found region-dependent patterns in the relationships of H' and FD with maximum lake depth: both indices decreased with maximum depth in the region with lakes more exposed to wind (ETR) but increased in the more hilly landscape where lakes are more sheltered from wind mixing (LR).
   5. Our study demonstrates that, for phytoplankton communities, a FD index can show simpler and stronger responses to environmental drivers than a taxonomically based index, while shedding further light onto the functional traits that are important in particular lake categories.

AB Filter-feeding mussels historically comprised most of benthic biomass in many streams. They contribute to stream ecosystem functioning by linking the water column and benthic habitats. Both native and nonnative species coexist in many streams, but their ecological roles are not well quantified. The invasive bivalve, Corbicula fluminea, has the potential to alter profoundly organic matter dynamics and nutrient cycling in streams. We compared stable isotope ratios and tissue and biodeposit stoichiometry of the native freshwater mussel, Elliptio crassidens, and C. fluminea in a Coastal Plain stream (Ichawaynochaway Creek, a tributary to the lower Flint River, Georgia, USA) to assess their trophic niche space and potential effects on nutrient cycling. We hypothesized that C. fluminea would assimilate a larger range of materials than E. crassidens. To determine dietary overlap of C. fltuninea and E. crassidens, we measured the elemental and stable isotopic compositions (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) of their tissue. Corbicula fluminea showed lower trophic fidelity than E. crassidens and was able to acquire and assimilate a wide range of resources, as illustrated by their wide range of delta(13)C values. Corbicula fluminea also might alter nutrient cycling in the benthic environment of streams because they retain less N than E. crassidens, as reflected by their higher tissue C:N. In the laboratory, we measured C and N in biodeposits (feces and pseudofeces) from the 2 species. Corbicula fluminea released more N through their biodeposits relative to E. crassidens by mass, a result implying that C. flurninen might modify nutrient cycling in streams. Our results show important differences in the food resources assimilated and the nutrients deposited as feces and pseudofeces by these 2 bivalves. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how invasive species, such as C. fluminea, can alter aquatic environments through differences in species traits within a functional group.

AB Key morphological traits reveal changes in functional morphospace occupation of reef fish assemblages over time. We used measurements of key functional attributes (i.e., lower jaw length and orbit diameter) of 208 fossil fish species from five geological periods to create bivariate plots of functional morphological traits through time. These plots were used to examine possible function and ecological characteristics of fossil reef fish assemblages throughout the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. A previously unknown trend of increasing orbit diameter over time became apparent. The Teleostei are the principal drivers of this change. The Eocene appears to mark a dramatic increase in two previously rare feeding modes in fishes: nocturnal feeding and high-precision benthic feeding. Interestingly, members of the Pycnodontiformes had relatively large eyes since the Triassic and appear to be the ecological precursors of their later teleost counterparts and may have been among the earliest nocturnal feeding fishes. Our results highlight potential changes in the roles of fishes on coral reefs through time.

AB Background: The presence of Bacillus in very diverse environments reflects the versatile metabolic capabilities of a widely distributed genus. Traditional phylogenetic analysis based on limited gene sampling is not adequate for resolving the genus evolutionary relationships. By distinguishing between core and pan-genome, we determined the evolutionary and functional relationships of known Bacillus.
   Results: Our analysis is based upon twenty complete and draft Bacillus genomes, including a newly sequenced Bacillus isolate from an aquatic environment that we report for the first time here. Using a core genome, we were able to determine the phylogeny of known Bacilli, including aquatic strains whose position in the phylogenetic tree could not be unambiguously determined in the past. Using the pan-genome from the sequenced Bacillus, we identified functional differences, such as carbohydrate utilization and genes involved in signal transduction, which distinguished the taxonomic groups. We also assessed the genetic architecture of the defining traits of Bacillus, such as sporulation and competence, and showed that less than one third of the B. subtilis genes are conserved across other Bacilli. Most variation was shown to occur in genes that are needed to respond to environmental cues, suggesting that Bacilli have genetically specialized to allow for the occupation of diverse habitats and niches.
   Conclusions: The aquatic Bacilli are defined here for the first time as a group through the phylogenetic analysis of 814 genes that comprise the core genome. Our data distinguished between genomic components, especially core vs. pan-genome to provide insight into phylogeny and function that would otherwise be difficult to achieve. A phylogeny may mask the diversity of functions, which we tried to uncover in our approach. The diversity of sporulation and competence genes across the Bacilli was unexpected based on previous studies of the B. subtilis model alone. The challenge of uncovering the novelties and variations among genes of the non-subtilis groups still remains. This task will be best accomplished by directing efforts toward understanding phylogenetic groups with similar ecological niches.

AB The link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is an important question that remains unresolved, particularly in marine systems, in which cycling of organic matter by benthic organisms is of global significance. Direct observations of specific resource use by each species in single- and multispecies communities, as quantified by stable isotopes, facilitates a mechanistic understanding of the importance of each species for ecosystem functioning. We tested the effects of altered biodiversity (species richness) of deposit-feeding macrofauna on incorporation and burial of phytodetritus in combinations of three species representing natural communities found in the sediments of the species-poor Baltic Sea. The three species, two amphipods and a bivalve, had different rates of incorporation and burial and different needs for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The amphipods exhibited clear resource partitioning in sympatry, as a result of vertical separation in the sediment and consequent differential use of food. Communities of several species incorporated more C and N than expected from the respective single-species treatments, due to higher incorporation by surface feeders in multispecies treatments. Community incorporation of N in the most diverse treatment even exceeded N incorporation by a single-species treatment of the best-performing species, showing transgressive over-yielding. This over-yielding was primarily due to positive complementarity in all treatments. Diverse soft bottoms are also likely to be more productive in the long run, as species-specific traits (subsurface feeding) preserve fresh phytodetritus by burying it to depths in the sediment at which the mineralization rate is low. The more diverse sediment communities showed more efficient trophic transfer of phytodetritus, a finding of general significance for understanding biological processes driving the transformation of nutrients and energy in benthic ecosystems.

DT Article
DE Aquatic macrophytes; Risk assessment; Tools; Guidance; Chemicals
AB Primary producers play critical structural and functional roles in aquatic ecosystems; therefore, it is imperative that the potential risks of toxicants to aquatic plants are adequately assessed in the risk assessment of chemicals. The standard required macrophyte test species is the floating (non-sediment-rooted) duckweed Lemna spp. This macrophyte species might not be representative of all floating, rooted, emergent, and submerged macrophyte species because of differences in the duration and mode of exposure; sensitivity to the specific toxic mode of action of the chemical; and species-specific traits (e.g., duckweed's very short generation time).
   These topics were addressed during the workshop entitled "Aquatic Macrophyte Risk Assessment for Pesticides" (AMRAP) where a risk assessment scheme for aquatic macrophytes was proposed. Four working groups evolved from this workshop and were charged with the task of developing Tier 1 and higher-tier aquatic macrophyte risk assessment procedures. Subsequently, a SETAC Advisory Group, the Macrophyte Ecotoxicology Group (AMEG) was formed as an umbrella organization for various macrophyte working groups. The purpose of AMEG is to provide scientifically based guidance in all aspects of aquatic macrophyte testing in the laboratory and field, including prospective as well as retrospective risk assessments for chemicals. As AMEG expands, it will begin to address new topics including bioremediation and sustainable management of aquatic macrophytes in the context of ecosystem services.

AB 1. The structure of biological communities reflects the influence of both local environmental conditions and processes such as dispersal that create patterns in species' distribution across a region.
   2. We extend explicit tests of the relative importance of local environmental conditions and regional spatial processes to aquatic plants, a group traditionally thought to be little limited by dispersal. We used partial canonical correspondence analysis and partial Mantel tests to analyse data from 98 lakes and ponds across Connecticut (northeastern United States).
   3. We found that aquatic plant community structure reflects the influence of local conditions (pH, conductivity, water clarity, lake area, maximum depth) as well as regional processes.
   4. Only 27% of variation in a presence/absence matrix was explained by environmental conditions and spatial processes such as dispersal. Of the total explained, 45% was related to environmental conditions and 40% to spatial processes.
   5. Jaccard similarity declined with Euclidean distance between lakes, even after accounting for the increasing difference in environmental conditions, suggesting that dispersal limitation may influence community composition in the region.
   6. The distribution of distances among lakes where species occurred was associated with dispersal-related functional traits, providing additional evidence that dispersal ability varies among species in ways that affect community composition.
   7. Although environmental and spatial variables explained a significant amount of variation in community structure, a substantial amount of stochasticity also affects these communities, probably associated with unpredictable colonisation and persistence of the plants.

AB The boraginaceous plants produce a number of valuable metabolites in their roots used in folk medicine. Some of these metabolites are colored and restricted to the epidermal root tissue. The functional attributes of these metabolites to the plant may be related to resistance against microbes. The effect of the root extracts of Arnebia hispidissima (Ar) and Echium rauwolfii (Ech) on growth and some metabolic traits of pigeonpea as well as their effect on two rhizospheric fungi was studied. The ethanolic root extract of both plants did not result in remarkable changes in the morphological characters of pigeonpea plants. The treatments decreased the fresh weight but increased the dry weight. The relative water contents of the leaves were increased upon treatments with Ech or Ar root extracts. The physiological parameters such as chlorophyll content, protein and carbohydrates were greatly affected by the roots extracts. Ech root extract has better increasing effect on these metabolites compared to Ar root extract. Both root extracts reduced variably the number of colonies of rhizospheric fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Thanatephorus cucumeris. They increased the fungal cell death within 12 h in vitro and caused increase in electrolyte leakage of the fungal cells suggesting that they have some compounds which targeting the cell membrane. The results indicated that the boraginaceous root extracts can improve the nutritional characteristics of pigeonpea as a fodder and may protect the plant against microbial pathogens.

AB Divergence in habitat use among closely related species is a common characteristic of adaptive radiations. Large differences in the size structure of prey between habitats could strengthen disruptive selection on generalist predators and lead to a divergence in trophic position among species in an adaptive radiation. Using threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in freshwater lakes as a model system, we examined whether divergence in habitat use coincides with shifts in trophic position. We examined the habitat use and trophic position of individual sticklebacks from divergent lake environments that have only one stickleback species (allopatric lakes) and from lakes that have a pair of benthic and limnetic stickleback species (sympatric lakes). In two sympatric lakes, the limnetic species had a higher trophic position than the benthic species, and in both allopatric and sympatric lakes, sticklebacks specializing on pelagic prey had a higher trophic position for a given size than sticklebacks specializing on benthic prey. Furthermore, the trophic position of pelagic specialists was correlated with individual variation in their gill raker length. Our results indicate that gill raker length is an important trait that underlies differentiation in both habitat use and trophic position among stickleback species, populations, and individuals.

AB Daphnia are an important and widely studied model species in ecological and toxicological studies throughout the world and an official (OECD) recommended test organism. Their small size, wide distribution and easy growth conditions make this organism ideal for functional genomics based studies, including metabolic profiling and transcriptomics. In this study we used an integrated systems approach in which transcriptomic, metabolomic and energetic responses of juvenile (4 days old) daphnids were evaluated in response to exposure to two poly aromatic hydrocarbons (pyrene and fluoranthene) and binary mixtures thereof. In addition, these responses were linked to responses measured during chronic experiments (21 days) assessing survival, growth and reproductive traits. Custom Daphnia magna microarrays were used to assess transcriptomic changes. Hierarchical cluster analysis did not result in a clear distinction between the single compounds suggesting similar molecular modes of action. Cluster analysis with both the single compounds and the binary mixture treatments resulted in a separation of treatments based on differences in toxic ratios rather than component differences. Changes in the metabolic profiles of the organisms were investigated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Gas and Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. These multivariate metabolomic datasets were analyzed with Principal Components Analysis and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis. The major metabolite changes responsible for the differences observed indicated a disturbance in aminosugar metabolism in all cases. The study demonstrates the potential of 'omics' to provide screening tools for monitoring of the freshwater environment in invertebrate species which is reasonably rapid, cost effective and has the potential to greatly increase the amount of information obtained from aquatic toxicology testing.

AB P>1. Positive interactions driven by ecosystem engineers have been determined to be important community forces in stressed environments. By ameliorating habitat conditions, ecosystem engineering can create available ecological niches for other species. In poorly oxygenated sediments of freshwater wetlands, small invertebrates such as tubificid worms and chironomid larvae are known to function as active bioturbators; however, their effects on the growth and physiology of organisms which are constrained by low oxygenation of sediments have never been studied.
   2. We examined whether the common bioturbator, Tubifex tubifex, significantly influences the growth and the physiological state of two plant species, Elodea canadensis and Myriophyllum spicatum, in experimental systems simulating a water-sediment interface of wetlands. We also quantified the influence of plant-animal interactions on biogeochemical processes (fluxes of oxygen and nitrogen at the water-sediment interface) and microbial compartment in sediments.
   3. Tubificid worms stimulated growth of aboveground and belowground biomasses of the two plants through reduction in the anoxic stress in sediments. Myriophyllum spicatum, which was the best adapted to sedimentary anaerobic conditions, essentially increased its biomass whereas E. canadensis, less adapted to anaerobic conditions, shifted its root metabolism from anaerobic to aerobic.
   4. Biogeochemical processes were not significantly influenced by plant-animal interactions: (i) oxygen flux from overlying water to sediments probably reached a threshold that could not be raised by the increased plant biomass induced by worms and (ii) nitrogen fluxes were essentially linked to bioturbation activities of worms.
   5. Our study confirmed that the reduction in constraining variables by physical habitat modifications (ecosystem engineering) may play a crucial role in community and ecosystem processes. The fact that positive interactions measured between ecosystem engineers and plant species in anoxic wetland sediments were highly dependent on the ecophysiology of plant species suggests an extension of this first study to a wide range of macrophytes in order to determine the main plant functional traits driving plant-animal interactions in wetland sediments.

AB Traian Orghidan's seminal paper on the hyporheic zone was published in German in Archiv fur Hydrobiologie 50 years ago. To celebrate this anniversary, it has now been translated into English and republished in Fundamental and Applied Limnology, the successor to Archiv fur Hydrobiologie, as part of this special issue on hyporheic zone ecology. Here we examine the development and current state of knowledge of four aspects of hyporheic zone ecology first articulated by Orghidan. First, we consider the ecotonal nature of the hyporheic zone (HZ) and its relationship to the wider stream ecosystem; second, surface water and groundwater habitat interconnectivity within the hyporheic zone; third, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the HZ and how this may influence its function as a refugium for taxa during disturbances; and lastly interactions between hyporheic invertebrates and pore water volume, bacterial densities and particulate organic carbon. We outline the characteristics of the hyporheic zone that may determine how effective it will be as a refugium for benthic taxa during disturbances and consider the biological traits of benthic species most able to utilise the HZ as a refugium. Finally, we examine an important avenue of research that has developed since Orghidans paper reflecting significant scientific and technological advances; the role of the hyporheic zone in stream nutrient dynamics. We conclude by considering some areas where further research is likely to advance our understanding of the hyporheic zone and its interaction with the wider stream ecosystem

AB Background: How particular changes in functional morphology can repeatedly promote ecological diversification is an active area of evolutionary investigation. The African rift-lake cichlids offer a calibrated time series of the most dramatic adaptive radiations of vertebrate trophic morphology yet described, and the replicate nature of these events provides a unique opportunity to test whether common changes in functional morphology have repeatedly facilitated their ecological success.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Specimens from 87 genera of cichlid fishes endemic to Lakes Tanganyka, Malawi and Victoria were dissected in order to examine the functional morphology of cichlid feeding. We quantified shape using geometric morphometrics and compared patterns of morphological diversity using a series of analytical tests. The primary axes of divergence were conserved among all three radiations, and the most prevalent changes involved the size of the preorbital region of the skull. Even the fishes from the youngest of these lakes (Victoria), which exhibit the lowest amount of skull shape disparity, have undergone extensive preorbital evolution relative to other craniofacial traits. Such changes have large effects on feeding biomechanics, and can promote expansion into a wide array of niches along a bentho-pelagic ecomorphological axis.
   Conclusions/Significance: Here we show that specific changes in trophic anatomy have evolved repeatedly in the African rift lakes, and our results suggest that simple morphological alterations that have large ecological consequences are likely to constitute critical components of adaptive radiations in functional morphology. Such shifts may precede more complex shape changes as lineages diversify into unoccupied niches. The data presented here, combined with observations of other fish lineages, suggest that the preorbital region represents an evolutionary module that can respond quickly to natural selection when fishes colonize new lakes. Characterizing the changes in cichlid trophic morphology that have contributed to their extraordinary adaptive radiations has broad evolutionary implications, and such studies are necessary for directing future investigations into the proximate mechanisms that have shaped these spectacular phenomena.

AB Semiarid saline streams are rare aquatic ecosystem types. Their constituent biota is expected to have adapted evolutionarily to strong hydrological variability and salinity stress; however, their ecology is not well known. In this study, we quantify the seasonal changes in the structure of the macroinvertebrate community in the Reventn Rambla (south-eastern Spain), a permanent saline spring stream which is included in a drainage system consisting of ephemeral dry channels (so-called "ramblas"). Seasonal patterns of community structure were studied in two reaches with contrasting environmental regimes using univariate and multivariate statistics. The upstream site showed more stable environmental conditions than the downstream site, and both sites also differed with regard to species richness, and structural and functional group attributes. On a seasonal basis, community dissimilarity was high during periods when both sites were isolated during summer droughts but dissimilarity decreased when both sites were connected through surface flow. Furthermore, the communities tended to show cyclical trajectories in multivariate ordination space. Rather than being related to salinity stress, these patterns seemed to track the hydrological disturbance regime of this rambla system. Spates tended to disrupt communities, while signs of recovery were evident during low-flow periods. Results suggest that salinity fluctuation does not pose a severe abiotic constraint to these adapted macroinvertebrate communities. Their suits of functional properties provide them with the necessary traits to recover quickly from natural disturbance. While human-caused salinization of streams severely impacts communities eventually reducing their recovery potential, our results suggest that communities in natural saline streams may show similar responses to hydrological disturbance as communities from non-saline streams.

AB P> A logical way of distinguishing functional groups of phytoplankton is to cluster species according to their functional traits, such as growth rate and nutrient assimilation constants. However, data for such an approach are lacking for the vast majority of the species.
   In this study, we show that a classification based on simple morphological traits may capture much of the variability in functional properties among the phytoplankton. We used information on more than 700 freshwater species, from more than 200 lakes situated in climate zones ranging from subpolar to tropical.
   Morphological characteristics correlated well with functional properties, such as growth rate and sinking rate, and also with the population size and biomass attained in the field. This suggests that morphology is a good predictor of the functional characteristics of species.
   Cluster analysis was used to define seven species groups based on morphology. Although some of the clusters are taxonomically homogeneous, others include species of several separate divisions. Functional traits (not used for the classification) differed significantly among the clusters, suggesting that the clusters may indeed represent meaningful functional groups.
   Advantages of our morphological approach to classification include its objectivity, its independence from taxonomic affiliations, and the relative ease of its application to the majority of species for which physiological traits are unknown and are not readily determined.

AB 1. A fundamental trade-off among vascular plants between traits inferring rapid resource acquisition and those leading to conservation of resources has now been accepted broadly, but is based on empirical data with a strong bias towards leaf traits. Here, we test whether interspecific variation in traits of different plant organs obeys this same trade-off and whether within-plant trade-offs are consistent between organs.
   2. Thereto, we measured suites of the same chemical and structural traits from the main vegetative organs for a species set representing aquatic, riparian and terrestrial environments including the main vascular higher taxa and growth forms of a subarctic flora. The traits were chosen to have consistent relevance for plant defence and growth across organs and environments: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, lignin, dry matter content, pH.
   3. Our analysis shows several new trait correlations across leaves, stems and roots and a striking pattern of whole-plant integrative resource economy, leading to tight correspondence between the local leaf economics spectrum and the root (r = 0.64), stem (r = 0.78) and whole-plant (r = 0.93) economics spectra.
   4. Synthesis. Our findings strongly suggest that plant resource economics is consistent across species' organs in a subarctic flora. We provide thus the first evidence for a 'plant economics spectrum' closely related to the local subarctic 'leaf economics spectrum'. Extending that concept to other biomes is, however, necessary before any generalization might be made. In a world facing rapid vegetation change, these results nevertheless bear considerable prospects of predicting below-ground plant functions from the above-ground components alone.

AB Life-history research has a long tradition in benthic biology because of its value in explaining patterns observed in nature, quantifying trophic relationships and energetics, and interpreting experimental results. We examined articles published in the Journal of the North American Benthological Society (J-NABS) during a 23-y period (volumes 5-27) to determine trends in life-history research and to assess future needs in these types of studies. Of the 9 life-history elements we examined, growth and mortality of benthic macroinvertebrates were most commonly reported in the 412 J-NABS Studies containing >= 1 of these elements Recruitment and dormancy were the least-studied elements, and development, reproduction, dispersal, voltinism, and phenology were intermediate. Most Of these Studies were based on aquatic insects, especially Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera, and mollusks (particularly bivalves). Detailed life histories of single species published in J-NABS have averaged similar to 1/volume, With most Studies being on Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata. Both detailed life-history Studies and Studies containing life-history elements have declined over time, especially when considered as a percentage of articles published in J-NABS In a timeline of important developments in life-history studies, 4 time periods or themes were evident 1) an emphasis on descriptive natural history, which was the earliest type of ecological research conducted and which extended into the 1970s, 2) synthesis of life-history information in books and review articles, which was most prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s, 3) adoption Of functional-feeding groups as a measure Of trophic Status of benthic organisms, which began in the 1970s and continues through today, and 4) the use of a species-trait approach to examine both basic and applied aspects of benthic biology, which began in the 1990s, is an expanding research area, and is a valuable application of life-history information. Life-history research has been published more often in specialized proceedings and regional journals than in J-NABS Clearly more life-history research is needed, but time, logistical considerations, and funding constraints restrict professional benthologists from conducting this kind of research Perhaps anglers and those participating in volunteer monitoring groups can be encouraged to conduct Studies to provide this needed information

AB Effective ecosystem management in the face of human alterations depends on our ability to quantify ecologically significant changes and to discriminate among impact levels and types We reviewed the literature on biological responses of freshwater biota to human disturbances over the last century. Many of the main methods for assessing ecological integrity originated in Europe [e g, Saprobien Index, Trent Biotic Index, Biological Monitoring Working Party, River InVertebrate Prediction And Classification System, multiple traits] or in North America [e.g., Index of Biotic Integrity, leaf-litter breakdown, functional feeding groups] We used bibliometric data to detail the contribution of J-NABS to developments in assessment of ecological integrity. A total of 225 bioassessment articles were published in J-NABS from 1986 to 2007 This total was similar to 1/2 of the number of bioassessment articles published over the same period in Freshwater Biology (FWB, another leading freshwater journal used for comparison), but the proportion of bioassessment articles in the 2 journals was similar (similar to 20%). The proportion of bioassessment articles in J-NABS has increased over the last 25 y. This trend indicates the growing interest in the topic and the delay (similar to 30 y since the Clean Water Act) of scientific action in response to water legislation Taxonomic composition and multivariate techniques, multimetric indices, lotic systems, macroinvertebrates, land use, and overall human impacts were major themes in J-NABS bioassessment articles. Progress in bioassessment is needed in 3 main areas First, bioassessments done at large spatial scales are needed to meet requirements of new environmental policies Second, bioassessment should shift from consideration of taxon losses to losses of ecological functions Third, statistical techniques are needed for predictive assessment of deviation in ecological integrity between expected (natural) and observed (natural or impacted) conditions. Assessment of functional integrity based on multiple traits is a promising area because biological traits represent universal biological characteristics that are connected to ecosystem functions However, the relationships between ecophysiological traits of individuals and ecosystem-scale responses must be properly defined for specific types of human impairment, and utility of the approach for routine bioassessments applied by managers must be tested.

AB Woody stems comprise a large biological carbon fraction and determine water transport between roots and leaves; their structure and function can influence both carbon and hydrological cycles. While angiosperm wood anatomy and density determine hydraulic conductivity and mechanical strength, little is known about interrelations across many species. We compiled a global data set comprising two anatomical traits for 3005 woody angiosperms: mean vessel lumen area ((A) over bar) and number per unit area (N). From these, we calculated vessel lumen fraction (F = (A) over barN) and size to number ratio (S = (A) over bar /N), a new vessel composition index. We examined the extent to which F and S influenced potential sapwood specific stem conductivity (K-S) and wood density (D; dry mass/fresh volume). F and S varied essentially independently across angiosperms. Variation in K-S was driven primarily by S, and variation in D was virtually unrelated to F and S. Tissue density outside vessel lumens (D-N) must predominantly influence D. High S should confer faster K-S but incur greater freeze-thaw embolism risk. F should also affect K-S, and both F and D-N should influence mechanical strength, capacitance, and construction costs. Improved theory and quantification are needed to better understand ecological costs and benefits of these three distinct dimensions.

AB Whole-animal performance abilities can facilitate the avoidance of predation and consequently influence fitness, but determining the functional significance of antipredation tactics is difficult without understanding how alternate predator escape strategies are related. We measured maximal sprint speed and dive duration in the semi-aquatic skink Oligosoma suteri to determine how morphology and behaviour influence these alternate predator escape techniques and the relationship between the two measures. Gravid females and juveniles ran significantly slower, but had equivalent or longer dive durations than males and nongravid females. The two performance measures were not influenced by the same morphological and behavioural traits, and were not correlated among individuals. Thus, individuals that are poor sprinters because of their state (e.g. gravid or tail-less individuals) would have a greater likelihood of successful escape by adopting an alternate escape strategy. For species that use multiple strategies for the same function, quantifying selection on whole-animal performance will be difficult.

AB The problem of how to deal with species sensitivity differences to toxic substances has been addressed successfully with the species sensitivity distribution (SSD), yet this has not increased understanding about the underlying mechanisms of sensitivity. Other researchers have identified the mode of action of chemicals and also biological traits of species as determinants for sensitivity, yet no systematic approach combines these factors. To achieve this, first existing data on organophosphate, carbamate, and pyrethroid toxicity and mode of action and also species trait information were mined. Second, we linked taxon sensitivity to their traits at the family level to generate empirical and mechanistic hypotheses about sensitivity-trait relationships. In this way, a mode-specific sensitivity (MSS) ranking method was developed, and tested at the taxonomic level of family and genus. The application of several quality criteria indicated overall confidence in rankings, but confidence in exact taxon rank was less certain, due to data insufficiency for certain groups. The MSS rankings were found to be applicable for trait-based approaches and were successfully linked to existing trait data to identify traits with predictive potential. Although this empirical analysis cannot test causality relation-hips between traits and sensitivity, testable hypotheses were generated, for further experimental investigation. Single traits as well as combinations of traits can be used to predict laboratory sensitivity to the substances tested, although associations were not as strong as in previous studies. We conclude that existing trait data are not suitable for every trait-based research question and that important traits remain to be identified and quantified in relation to the processes of toxicity, i.e., the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics.

AB Variation in traits causes bacterial populations to respond in contrasting ways to environmental drivers. Learning about this will help us understand the ecology of individual populations in complex ecosystems. We used 454 pyrosequencing of the hypervariable region V6 of the 16S rRNA gene to study seasonal dynamics in Baltic Sea bacterioplankton communities, and link community and population changes to biological and chemical factors. Surface samples were collected from May to October 2003 and in May 2004 at the Landsort Deep in the central Baltic Sea Proper. The analysis rendered, on average, 20 200 sequence reads for each of the eight samples analyzed, providing the first detailed description of Baltic Sea bacterial communities. Community composition varied dramatically over time, supporting the idea of strong temporal shifts in bacterioplankton assemblages, and clustered according to season (including two May samples from consecutive years), suggesting repeatable seasonal succession. Overall, community change was most highly correlated with change in phosphorus concentration and temperature. Individual bacterial populations were also identified that tightly co-varied with different Cyanobacteria populations. Comparing the abundance profiles of operational taxonomic units at different phylogenetic distances revealed a weak but significant negative correlation between abundance profile similarity and genetic distance, potentially reflecting habitat filtering of evolutionarily conserved functional traits in the studied bacterioplankton.

AB Clonal multiplication is a predominant type of reproduction in wetland species. However, both wetlands and plant organs of clonal growth are diverse, thus due to different stress factors operating in various wetlands preponderance of plants with specific clonal growth organs (CGOs) can be expected. To test this hypothesis the CGO spectra of wetland communities of the Netherlands were analysed, including a bog, a fen, heathland, a floodplain, river beds, fresh water pools, open salt water and a salt marsh. Moreover, it was evaluated whether different CGOs are characterised by different functional traits (shoot cyclicity, persistence of connections between ramets, number of offspring produced per year and lateral spread per year) in wetland species. Data on types of CGO, i.e., epigeogenous and hypogeogenous rhizomes, fragments and budding plants, stolons, tubers and bulbs, root-splitters, root-sprouters and special adaptations (turions) as well as their functional traits, were taken from the CLO-PLA 3 database. CGO spectra of wetland communities were analysed using two methods: comparison of observed vs. expected CGO spectra based on the presence/absence data and multivariate analysis (CCA) for inter-community differences considering species frequency. Moreover, relationships between CGOs and their functional traits were tested using multidimensional contingency tables. Apart from 26% of non-clonal species, the majority of wetland species was rhizomatous (51%). Other types of CGO were represented in less than 10% of species and root-derived CGOs were underrepresented (<2%) in comparison with terrestrial habitats. Among communities, fresh water pools and open salt water hosted higher proportion of species with fragments (similar to 10%) and turions (similar to 30%). Multivariate analysis divided wetland communities along the disturbance and hydric (water) gradients. Highly disturbed communities (salt marshes) were characterised by non-clonal species and species with root-derived CGOs. Aquatic communities (fresh water pools and open salt water) hosted species with the ability to spread by fragmentation and turions, contrary to permanently wet communities (bog and wet heathland) with the prevalence of species with epigeogenous rhizomes. It was also confirmed that the CGOs of wetland species differed in their traits. The most important functional trait characterising individual CGOs in the wetland flora was the degree of lateral spread (explained variability: 53%) followed by duration of persistence of connections between ramets (explained variability: 74%), which is in accordance with earlier distinguished strategies of clonal growth: integrator/splitter and spreading/non-spreading clones.

AB Restoration management frequently focuses on recreating suitable environmental conditions for a 'target vegetation'. This approach neglects the importance of habitat diversity and spatial configuration for individual species. Here, we investigate the role of environmental heterogeneity in a restoration context and report the response of aquatic macroinvertebrates to rewetting measures, which were taken to mitigate desiccation in a bog landscape. Because only parts of the study area were affected by re-wetting measures, changes in aquatic macroinvertebrates could be compared between re-wetted and non-rewetted parts. In addition, species were grouped into life-history strategies to test whether the invertebrate response differed between functional species groups. Total species numbers declined in the re-wetted parts and invertebrate assemblages became more similar both in terms of species and life-history strategies. These results indicate that large-scale re-wetting caused a functional homogenization. Changes in environmental conditions following re-wetting could be consistently related to changes in strategy composition. Retention of rainwater decreased the influence of groundwater. Here species increased that are adapted to physiological stress as well as those employing risk spreading, which indicates that environmental conditions had become harsher and less predictable. In contrast, reduced drainage locally increased groundwater influence, with life-history strategies indicating enhanced predictability of environmental conditions. Importantly, such conditions also characterise lagg zones and transitional mires in pristine raised bog landscapes, which are hotspots for biodiversity. Thus, while large-scale re-wetting decreased environmental heterogeneity, increasing the supply of groundwater seems a more promising restoration strategy for aquatic invertebrates in degraded peatlands.

AB Understanding the mechanistic links between environmental drivers, human disturbance, plant functional traits, and ecosystem properties is a fundamental aspect of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research. Recent studies have focused mostly on leaf-level traits or community-level weighted traits to predict species responses to grazing and the consequent change in ecosystem functioning. However, studies of leaf-level traits or community-level weighted traits seldom identify the mechanisms linking grazing impact on leaf traits to ecosystem functioning. Here, using a multi-organization-level approach, we examined the effects of grazing on leaf traits (i.e., leaf area, leaf dry mass and specific leaf area) and ecosystem functioning across six communities of three vegetation types along a soil moisture gradient in the Xilin River Basin of Inner Mongolia grassland, China. Our results showed that the effects of grazing on leaf traits differed substantially when scaling up from leaf-level to species, functional group (i.e., life forms and water ecotype types), and community levels; and they also varied with vegetation type or site conditions. The effects of grazing on leaf traits diminished progressively along the hierarchy of organizational levels in the meadow, whereas the impacts were predominantly negative and the magnitude of the effects increased considerably at higher organizational levels in the typical steppe. Soil water and nutrient availability, functional trade-offs between leaf size and number of leaves per individual, and differentiation in avoidance and tolerance strategies among coexisting species are likely to be responsible for the observed responses of leaf traits to grazing at different levels of organization and among vegetation types. Our findings also demonstrate that, at both the functional group and community levels, standing aboveground biomass increased with leaf area and specific leaf area. Compared with the large changes in leaf traits and standing aboveground biomass, the soil properties were relatively unaffected by grazing. Our study indicates that a multi-organization-level approach provides more robust and comprehensive predictions of the effects of grazing on leaf traits and ecosystem functioning.

AB Six conclusions have emerged from recent research that complicate the ability to predict how biodiversity losses may affect ecosystem function: (1) species traits determine ecosystem function, (2) species within functional groups are not always ecological equivalents, (3) biodiversity losses include declines in the abundance of common species, (4) biodiversity losses affect whole food webs, (5) the effects of biodiversity losses depend on abiotic and biotic context and spatial and temporal scales, and (6) successfully predicting linkages between biodiversity and ecosystem function requires using multiple empirical approaches across scales. Nutrient recycling by freshwater mussel communities illustrates these conclusions. Nutrient excretion rates depend on the expression of mussel species traits, which vary with flow, temperature, and coin in unity structure. Nutrient contributions from mussels depend on which mussel species are dominant, but common species of mussels are declining, leading to shifts in species dominance patterns and thus nutrient recycling. These changes are very likely affecting the rest of the benthic food web because mussel excretion stimulates primary and subsequently secondary, production.

AB This long-term study (23 yr) aims at specifying the characteristic features of secondary progressive successions in abandoned wet eutrophic grasslands as a precondition for better understanding causal relationships and improving the predictability of successions on such habitats The vegetation of inundated fen grasslands (Calthion) at the lower course of the river Wumme near Bremen (Northwest Germany) was studied annually on three permanent plots (each 10 x 10 m(2)) where hay making had ceased in 1983, 1985 and 1992, respectively In the initial succession phase of three to five years a fast increase of tall-growing, rhizomatous, deciduous reed species (e g Phalaris arundinacea) occurred This strongly changed vegetation structure and within-canopy light climate, which was the reason for the strong decrease in species diversity Rhizomes are hypothesized to be a key factor of high competitiveness in abandoned wet grasslands because this organ combines multiple advantageous functions low-risk vegetative propagation, nutrient storage and nutrient re-allocation between above- and below-ground plant organs, all these functions allowing for a gradual build-up of a high biomass Extinct grassland species (e g Senecio aquaticus) represent a contrasting set of plant traits such as small stature, short lifespan, prevailing generative reproduction and evergreen leaves. The subsequent succession phase commencing about five years after mowing was ceased was characterized by persistence of the established reed vegetation, which prevented tree colonisation until today. Secondary successions in abandoned wet eutrophic grasslands can be predicted on the level of plant communities and functional species groups considering changes in the habitat (esp. light climate), the presence of reed species with a specific set of plant traits in the "Initial Floristic Composition" and their potentially high competitive vigour.

AB The ability to smell is governed by the largest gene family in mammalian genomes, the olfactory receptor (OR) genes. Although these genes are well annotated in the finished human and mouse genomes, we still do not understand which receptors bind specific odorants or how they fully function. Previous comparative studies have been taxonomically limited and mostly focused on the percentage of OR pseudogenes within species. No study has investigated the adaptive changes of functional OR gene families across phylogenetically and ecologically diverse mammals. To determine the extent to which OR gene repertoires have been influenced by habitat, sensory specialization, and other ecological traits, to better understand the functional importance of specific OR gene families and thus the odorants they bind, we compared the functional OR gene repertoires from 50 mammalian genomes. We amplified more than 2000 OR genes in aquatic, semi-aquatic, and flying mammals and coupled these data with 48,000 OR genes from mostly terrestrial mammals, extracted from genomic projects. Phylogenomic, Bayesian assignment, and principle component analyses partitioned species by ecotype (aquatic, semi-aquatic, terrestrial, flying) rather than phylogenetic relatedness, and identified OR families important for each habitat. Functional OR gene repertoires were reduced independently in the multiple origins of aquatic mammals and were significantly divergent in bats. We reject recent neutralist views of olfactory subgenome evolution and correlate specific OR gene families with physiological requirements, a preliminary step toward unraveling the relationship between specific odors and respective OR gene families.

AB Structure and function of the Serio River (northern Italy) ecosystem have been evaluated analyzing macroinvertebrate community functional traits. Starting from traits such as Functional Feeding Groups (FFG), Functional Habit Groups (FHG), voltinism and drift behavior, we determined values that can integrate direct measurements of ecosystem attributes and can be used in restoration planning. We collected invertebrates and environmental data in eight sites representative of the longitudinal succession of Serio River environments. High values for most of the ecosystem attributes, indicating good functionality, were confined in three sites of the upstream alpine sector, while downstream the ecosystem was severely impaired and colonized by non-specialized, pioneer communities. The intrinsic information given by ecosystem attributes helped aid the understanding of the health of specific ecosystem functions, thus leading to evaluation of priorities in restoration efforts. This methodology can be a complementary tool in river quality assessment if macroinvertebrate quantitative data are available. Particularly, it can be used in accordance with the new quantitative sampling protocols being adopted in the European Union, and it can define new metrics in a multimetric evaluation system.

AB In Mediterranean streams, droughts and floods are mainly seasonal and predictable, occurring twice or three times a year. Under these conditions, multivoltinism and short life-cycles would be favoured, particularly for organisms with low migratory capacity. The meiofaunal community is therefore hypothesised to have species traits adapted to these hydrological perturbations. However, meiofauna have been neglected in many lotic studies. The present study examined the temporal variability of meiofaunal density and biomass over a 2-year period in three reaches of a low-order Mediterranean stream. Relationships between biological traits and hydrological and environmental characteristics were investigated. Resilience of meiofauna to floods was quantified using regression. Small differences in basin drainage resulted in different responses. The abundance and resilience of the meiofauna were higher in the upstream reach than those in the downstream communities. A small, worm-shaped body and active locomotor structures conferred higher resilience in the face of natural hydrological disturbances. Low-order reaches are refugia for functionally important meiofauna that can eventually repopulate downstream reaches.

AB To assess the effect of variability in hydrodynamic stress on benthic assemblages we investigated whether deposit-feeding macrobenthos performs a unimodal response to an intertidal flat hydrodynamic stress gradient, congruent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), and whether this response is related to assemblage-wide biological trait displacements, reflecting species sorting mechanisms. Patterns in diversity and assemblage-wide biological traits were explained to a large extent by hydrodynamic stress and reflected in a significantly differing assemblage structure between stress levels. Our data did not support the IDH, since species richness and diversity peaked at low stress, whereas evenness was lowest at intermediate stress, suggesting that species sorting in response to hydrodynamic stress, rather than competitive exclusion at low stress, drives the diversity stress response. The decrease in species richness and diversity towards the hydrodynamically harsher low intertidal was reflected in the assemblage-wide shifts towards a lower dietary dependency on microalgal carbon and a deeper living position. Intermediate stressed assemblages were associated with a shift towards a more resistant development mode to superficial sediment disturbance. This is suggested to result from species sorting in response to Cerastoderma edule interference from bioturbation, which peaked at intermediate hydrodynamic stress where optimal hydrodynamic conditions for suspension feeders prevail. The present study demonstrated that the alteration of the natural hydrodynamic regime will significantly affect tidal flat benthic community composition and, hence, ecosystem functioning. Additionally, our findings reveal that inhibitory biophysical interactions, such as interference from bioturbation, should be incorporated in environmental stress biodiversity models.

AB To date, investigations of the positive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning among global marine ecosystems, and the management initiatives derived from these studies, have focused exclusively on species richness. We hypothesize that body size variations that occur among size-structured aquatic ecosystems subjected to exploitation may also contribute to these patterns. Our analyses of maximum lengths of 12 151 fish species from 56 exploited large marine ecosystems (LMEs) revealed a 2-fold variation in geometric mean lengths, that were strongly and negatively correlated with species richness. LMEs characterized by larger mean sizes were also skewed towards dominance by large species. The expected positive and significant correlation between mean fish length and latitude (characterized as Bergmann's Rule) was observed among North Atlantic, South Pacific, and Indian Ocean (southern latitudes) LMEs, but not in 3 other regions, including the North Pacific. In the North Atlantic, anomalous long-term declines in top predator catch rates (one measure of ecosystem functioning) occurred, and within temperate North Atlantic LMEs, species size distributions were more skewed towards large species relative to North Pacific LMEs. Our global analyses indicate that fish body size may act as a factor of considerable importance in mediating the relationship between global marine fish species richness and ecosystem functioning, and that management initiatives to ensure ecosystem stability in the face of exploitation should include the restoration and maintenance of this important functional trait.

AB Photoacclimation models are a prerequisite for accurate estimates of primary production in aquatic environments under typically variable light conditions. They generally start from empirical functions of the internal chlorophyll a (chl a) or nutrient quota (e.g. the Droop model). We propose that physiological variations in phytoplankton reflect phenotypic adaptation which maximizes the growth rate. Growth maximization has to account for indirect effects of the enhancement of carbon (C) acquisition by acclimation, primarily through concomitant changes in the intracellular nitrogen (N) budget. Our model expresses, for the first time, the indirect effect of alterations in N uptake on C assimilation by a parameter-free trade-off between the 2 uptake functions. The model explicitly prescribes optimal protein partitioning between N and C uptake and sub-partitioning into carboxylation (1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, Rubisco) and light harvesting. Applications to various published experimental data for different phytoplankton species support the validity of the optimality hypothesis and point to different flexibility in the re-organization of chloroplasts between taxa as well as to different time-scales on which photoacclimation operates. Simulations of a batch culture with the haptophyte Isochrysis galbana show that a decoupling in pigment N:C from cellular N:C may explain observed lag phases in chl a:C regulation. For diatoms, seemingly stronger constraints in intra-cellular stoichiometry determine the photoacclimative response to variable light regimes, as simulated and reported for Skeletonema costatum. N and chl a quotas correlate well in nutrient-limited chemostats of Thalassiosira fluviatilis, but in part decouple under light limitation. In N limited growth, non-linearity in N:C as expressed by the Droop function results from a combination of a linear quota dependency, down-regulation of relative carboxylation capacity, and increasing N costs of chl a synthesis at elevated growth rates. Our optimality assumption that includes indirect feed-backs through the concept of protein partitioning generates an accurate model for adaptation in physiological traits.

AB The importance of different functional traits of macrobenthos in benthic processes of the Southern Bight of the North Sea was investigated to estimate the effects of density declines and species loss on benthic ecosystem functioning. Two laboratory experiments were performed: before (winter, temperature = 10 degrees C) and after (summer, temperature = 18 degrees C) sedimentation of the spring phytoplankton bloom. Single species treatments of key species (Abra alba, Lanice conchilega and Nephtys sp.) with different functional traits were added to microcosms at 3 density levels (natural, lower, lowest) to account for possible density declines. Sediment-water exchanges of oxygen and nutrients, denitrification and bioturbation were measured. In absence of fauna, benthic mineralisation in the summer experiment was 2.0 times higher than in winter. Fauna stimulated microbial respiration more in summer (up to 100% in L, conchilega treatments) than in winter (negligible fauna effect). As chlorophyll a concentrations were similar in both seasons, the stronger fluxes in summer must be explained by a higher macrobenthic activity owing to the elevated temperature and better condition of the animals. Stimulation of mineralisation by the 3 species in the microcosms was different, and behaviour-related. Owing to its irrigation activity, the tube dweller L. conchilega had more pronounced influences on benthic respiration, nutrient release and denitrification than did the biodiffusers, A. alba and Nephtys sp. A. alba appeared to be a more effective bioturbator than Nephtys sp. Processes such as benthic respiration, nutrient fluxes, denitrification and bioturbation seem to be related to animal densities and therefore decreases in densities can possibly have implications for ecosystem functioning.

AB Studies conducted in terrestrial ecosystems have shown that increasing plant diversity enhances ecosystem processes such as primary production. In marine systems, knowledge of how plant diversity influences ecosystem processes and higher trophic levels is still limited. To examine how plant richness and composition influence recruitment and colonization processes, defaunated eelgrass (Zostera marina), sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) and perfoliate pondweed (Potamogeton perfoliatus) were planted on an unvegetated, sandy bottom in all possible combinations in July and August. Both field experiments lasted 1 week. Our results showed that in these plant assemblages plant richness had a negative effect on faunal diversity (H') and evenness (I'), while total abundance showed strong temporal variation with weak, positive relationships with plant species richness in both August and July. Plant species composition had strong effects on amphipods (Gammarus spp.), thus both the abundance and biomass were higher in treatments containing P. perfoliatus. The colonization process was significantly influenced by the numerical dominance of a few faunal species, e.g. the settlement of lagoon cockles (Cerastoderma glaucum), and by the timing of the experiments. The results indicate that faunal colonization in these communities is rapid and significantly influenced by the traits of particular plant species. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biodiversity conservation does predominantly focus on protected natural areas, but has to consider also the usually Human-dominated matrix in which these natural areas are embedded. Here we study highway stormwater retention ponds, which may act as refuges for native flora and fauna and contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity in Human-dominated landscapes. However, the biodiversity supported by such artificial ponds has received little attention so far. Using standardised methods, we addressed the potential role of highway stormwater ponds as refuges by comparing aquatic macroinvertebrate communities (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Odonata and Gastropoda) in highway stormwater ponds with ponds in the wider landscape. As expected from their pollutant retention function, highway ponds differed in abiotic conditions from surrounding ponds. However, they supported aquatic macroinvertebrate communities at least as rich and diverse at the family level as surrounding ponds and exhibited similar variability in family community composition and structure. The main difference we observed was a higher abundance of small and/or short-lived invertebrates in the highway ponds. These similar community compositions and structures suggest that highway ponds contribute to the biodiversity of the pond network at a regional scale. Thus, road practitioners should consider highway ponds not only for their hydrological and pollutant retaining purposes but also as a possibility to increase the role of highway verges as a refuge and, consequently, landscape connectivity. The management of these water bodies should recognise their potential for biodiversity especially in Human-dominated landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The modern theories of sexual selection predict that male sexual ornaments may have evolved as reliable signals of male fertilization efficiency. However, among the studies of fishes with external fertilization, the results have yielded ambiguous evidence. In the present study, we present data on the phenotypic relationships between red spawning coloration and ejaculate quality (spermatocrit, sperm motility) from Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus. We studied two generations (F(1) and F(2)) of males from a large lake population, reared in a standardized hatchery environment, to determine whether differential hatchery history, or duration of hatchery selection, affected the variation in ejaculate characteristics or abdominal coloration. After controlling for body length, there was no difference between the hatchery generations in these traits. However, the degree of redness increased with fish size. We found a positive correlation between sperm velocity and sperm longevity, indicating a functional integration between these sperm features across generations. Sperm velocity was also positively correlated with male redness. Therefore, the finding obtained in the present study suggests that the carotenoid-based ornamentation in Arctic charr may provide information about differences between males in their fertilization potential.

AB P> Among vertebrates, herbivores have longer digestive tracts than animals at higher trophic levels, a pattern thought to reflect a trade-off between digestive efficiency and tissue maintenance costs. However, phylogenetic influences on this pattern have rarely been considered. Taxa that have undergone diversification accompanied by dietary shifts provide a powerful opportunity to examine the relationship between diet and intestine length while accounting for phylogeny.
   In this paper we assess the relationship between diet and intestine length in the cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika, which are renowned for their diversity of species and trophic strategies.
   First, we test the effect of trophic position on intestine length across 32 species, while controlling for phylogeny. Trophic position was inferred from nitrogen stable isotopes, which provide a temporally integrated, quantitative perspective on the complex diets of tropical fish. Second, we examine patterns of intraspecific variation in intestine length of an algivorous cichlid (Tropheus brichardi) along a natural spatial gradient in algal nitrogen content.
   Trophic position explains 51% of size-standardized variation in intestine length after accounting for phylogeny. Accounting for phylogeny does not substantially alter the relationship between trophic position and intestine length, despite the existence of phylogenetic signal in both traits. Thus, diet is a strong predictor of variation at the interspecific level.
   There is a striking inverse relationship between intestine length and algal nutrient content among populations of T. brichardi, suggesting substantial plasticity in response to food quality, and thus a strong dietary influence on patterns of intraspecific variation.
   Diet is a strong predictor of intestine length at both intra- and interspecific scales, indicating that fish adjust their phenotype to balance nutritional needs against energetic costs. Furthermore, functional explanations for trophic diversification of cichlid fishes in the African Great Lakes have long focused on jaw structures, but our results indicate that intestinal plasticity in response to diet quality may also be an important mechanism for accommodating trophic shifts during evolutionary radiations.

AB P>For decades, organisms with inducible defences have been used extensively as model systems for addressing the ecology and evolution of phenotypic plasticity. However, our current understanding of inducible defences comes largely from studies that have examined the survival benefits of an inducible defence in a predator environment vs. the growth or reproductive costs in a no-predator environment. Moreover, this work has focused on a single point in prey development. Unfortunately, this approach neglects the role that functionally different predator species (with divergent selection pressures) may play in maintaining inducible defences in prey populations and overlooks the dynamic nature of prey responses and prey vulnerability over development.
   In this study, we used freshwater snails and a subset of their predators to address the survival costs and benefits of predator-induced plasticity in response to functionally different predators at multiple points in development.
   We found that snails altered unique suites of traits over development in response to three different caged predator environments. Moreover, short-term predation trials demonstrated that the phenotype induced by one predator had higher survival with that predator than any alternative phenotype but lower survival with a different predator species (i.e. survival trade-offs). However, the trade-off was only strongly detected midway in development before a size refuge was attained from predation and after morphological defences had formed in the snails.
   Our study suggests that functionally different predators favour inducible defences in freshwater snails, and that incorporating development into tests of the adaptive plasticity hypothesis can provide valuable information about the dynamics of trait induction and variation in fitness trade-offs over time.

AB Successful invasions are attributed to a combination of adaptations to biotic and abiotic conditions and many studies have highlighted the role of biological traits of invaders in their success. Among the most useful traits for successful establishment in a new ecosystem are the size of the invader and its diet and feeding habits. During the last twenty years, Dikerogammarus villosus has been one of the most successful invaders of large European rivers and lakes. However, regarding feeding habits, results were confusing and sometimes contradictory. In this study, we attempt to define the feeding strategy of D. villosus using their FA content according to sex and the seasonal and the spatial variation in its feeding habit. Our results indicated that D. villosus is rather unspecialized with plasticity in its feeding behaviour, switching between different functional feeding groups depending on seasons, habitats and available resources. The selection of high quality resources may hence provide a strong advantage during the invasion process by optimizing the growth and the reproduction of the invader.

AB The distribution range of fishes along an upstream-downstream gradient within a river basin is determined by the ecological requirements of each fish species. This differential pattern of distribution may suggest the occurrence of fish zones, where different functional guilds would prevail. The earliest concept of fish zonation highlighted the preferential position of several species in European rivers. Nowadays, there is a consensus that for a broad application of this concept, it is necessary to consider the division in functional groups along the downstream profile as related to reproductive, feed and population dynamics traits. However, for a number of tropical systems, such information does not exist. In this case, it is possible to use the fish family as a surrogate metric, by assuming that it fully covers common aspects of morphology, feeding, and behavior. Using this surrogate metric, we analyzed the distribution range of fish species along an elevation gradient in a typical Atlantic Forest basin in southeast Brazil. Our objective was to delimit fish zones based on the representativeness of some dominant fish families. Between 2006 and 2008, we sampled 42 sites from the estuary to the headwater creeks in elevations that varied from 3 to 783 m. The data were explored using the species (or family) occurrence, relative numerical abundance (N'), relative biomass (B'), and the importance index (IP). We applied the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to ordinate the sampling sites using the Jaccard distance calculated on the species occurrence matrix. Data on family importance were superimposed to the NMDS to check how the distribution and the abundance of the families were correlated to the ordination. We caught 64 species distributed among 25 fish families. Based on the dominance of some families, we propose that the fish assemblage in the Itanha,m river basin can be organized in four fish zones (FZ) and three transitory zones (TZ), which replace each other along the longitudinal gradient. The marine/estuarine fishes dominated in FZ1 and TZ1. The freshwater fishes were dominated by Characidae (FZ2), Heptapteridae (FZ3), and Gymnotidae (FZ4). TZ2 was equally dominated by Characidae, Loricariidae, and Heptapteridae. The distinct assemblage composition along the FZ's may relate to complex interactions involving seasonal patterns of variation in salinity levels (next to estuary), slope, presence of downstream barriers, and availability of food resources. We expect that the patterns observed in our study will also be presented in other coastal Atlantic Forest basins in Southeast Brazil.

AB P>1. Effective restoration of ecosystem structure and function needs to be built on a strong conceptual basis. The evaluation of restoration is critical in this respect, as it requires an accurate understanding of vegetation dynamics. This study was, therefore, designed to analyse how initial restoration treatments and spontaneous ecological processes act together to produce spatial heterogeneity of plant species at various scales, taking into account that species might respond differentially to these processes in accordance with their biological attributes.
   2. In a model system consisting of a large land settlement located on the banks of the river Rhone (France), 85 geo-referenced plots were located, and the abundance of all plant species and seven biotic and abiotic environmental factors that have been modified by restoration were recorded. All species were classified into emergent groups (EGs) based on 12 plant traits, and the abundance of each EG was derived for each plot. Spatial variables that explained the spatial autocorrelation of the EGs at four scales were computed. This was performed using a spatial eigenvector mapping technique. The spatial variables were then linked to a range of selected environmental factors.
   3. Large-scale patterning of EGs was explained mainly by the spatial heterogeneity of soil quality and vegetation cover. The attribute combination of the EGs that varied most at this scale suggested that the restoration had influenced vegetation development by inducing harsh physical conditions in some part of the studied area and biotic filtering (through competition) in others.
   4. A large amount of the spatial variation of EGs was not explained by the environmental factors providing some evidence for pure spatial autocorrelation effects. At the finest scale, this was linked to poor dispersal abilities of some EGs.
   5.Synthesis and applications. By combining a trait-based approach with spatially explicit methods, we explained and quantified the role of environmental changes induced by restoration and spontaneous biotic processes in structuring plant communities on different spatial scales within a large land settlement. We discuss how such an approach offers new opportunities for an improved assessment of induced and spontaneous structuring factors for restoring and for monitoring plant communities during ecological restoration.

AB According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, common indicators are needed to monitor the loss of biodiversity and the implications for the sustainable provision of ecosystem services. However, a variety of indicators are already being used resulting in many, mostly incompatible, monitoring systems. In order to synthesise the different indicator approaches and to detect gaps in the development of common indicator systems, we examined 531 indicators that have been reported in 617 peer-reviewed journal articles between 1997 and 2007. Special emphasis was placed on comparing indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem services across ecosystems (forests, grass- and shrublands, wetlands, rivers, lakes, soils and agro-ecosystems) and spatial scales (from patch to global scale). The application of biological indicators was found most often focused on regional and finer spatial scales with few indicators applied across ecosystem types. Abiotic indicators, such as physico-chemical parameters and measures of area and fragmentation, are most frequently used at broader (regional to continental) scales. Despite its multiple dimensions, biodiversity is usually equated with species richness only. The functional, structural and genetic components of biodiversity are poorly addressed despite their potential value across habitats and scales. Ecosystem service indicators are mostly used to estimate regulating and supporting services but generally differ between ecosystem types as they reflect ecosystem-specific services. Despite great effort to develop indicator systems over the past decade, there is still a considerable gap in the widespread use of indicators for many of the multiple components of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and a need to develop common monitoring schemes within and across habitats. Filling these gaps is a prerequisite for linking biodiversity dynamics with ecosystem service delivery and to achieving the goals of global and sub-global initiatives to halt the loss of biodiversity.

AB Spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns of free-living marine nematodes were studied in Cienfuegos Bay, a tropical semi-enclosed basin in the Caribbean Sea. Taxonomic (to species level) and functional (biological trait) approaches were applied for describing the assemblage structure and relating it to abiotic environment based on a sampling scheme in six subtidal stations and three months. Biological trait approach added relevant information to species pattern regarding relationships between diversity patterns and the abiotic environment. The most common morphotypes were deposit feeding nematodes, with colonising abilities of 2-3 (in a scale from 1 to 5), tail conical cylindrical or filiforme and body slender; and their abundance were correlated with depth, organic matter and silt/clay fraction. In spite of a high turnover of species, functional diversity of assemblages did not change notably in space and time. A result probably due to sampling of the habitat pool of species and to low heterogeneity of the studied muddy bottoms. Chemical pollution (organic enrichment and heavy metals) and hydrodynamic regime possibly drove the biodiversity patterns. Spatial distribution of assemblages support the existence of two well differentiated basins inside the bay, the northern basin more polluted than the southern one. The low hydrodynamic regime would determine a poor dispersion of nematodes resulting in high spatial variance in the assemblage structure; and also the associated hypoxic conditions and pollutants in sediments can explain the dominance of tolerant nematode species such as Daptonema oxycerca, Sabatieria pulchra, Terschellingia gourbaultae, and Terschellingia longicaudata. A comparison of spatial-temporal patterns of biodiversity between Cienfuegos Bay and other semi-enclosed bays in temperate regions suggests several similarities: nematode assemblages are strongly influenced by anthropogenic disturbance, temporal trends are weak or overridden by spatial ones, and few cosmopolitan genera/species tolerant to pollution and hypoxic conditions are dominant.

AB Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. is an important species for agroforestry and commercial plantations in India. Results of a combined provenance-progeny trial of E. tereticornis laid out in 2002 at Midnapore (West Bengal) located in eastern tropical region of India are reported and discussed. Twelve provenances representing 70 families from Australia and Papua New Guinea were evaluated up to the age of 3 years. As a local seed source open-pollinated seed collected from a land race, i.e., Mysore gum (commonly known as Eucalyptus hybrid) was used to serve as check material (control). Significant variation in plant height, clean stem height, girth at breast height (GBH) and field survival was observed due to provenances, as well as families within provenances. This offers an ample scope to a breeder for increasing the growth and productivity in E. tereticornis through selection of provenances and families having potential for higher productivity. Heritability (narrow sense) values were appreciable for growth traits. Within provenance individual tree heritability estimates for height, clean stem length, GBH and number of branches at age 3 years were 0.318, 0.215, 0.269 and 0.231, respectively (assuming a coefficient of relationship of 0.4 for open-pollinated families of E. tereticomis). Provenance of Walsh River, Queensland Australia performed best for plant height, clean stem height, GBH, number of branches and field survival. Apart from this, the provenance from Oro bay to Emo, Papua New Guinea and Burdekin river, Queensland also showed good performance. Provenance from Yurammie, SF from New South Wales performed poorest for growth and survival. Correlations on growth traits were high and statistically significant, indicating that substantial gains could be achieved through indirect selection for one trait based on the direct selection for another. Age-age genetic correlations between age 1 and 3 years for the growth traits were highly significant and positive. Geographic clinal variation pattern was observed as latitude was negatively correlated with height and GBH (P < 0.05); longitude with number of branches (negative, P < 0.05). Fair differences were observed between phenotypic and genotypic coefficient of variability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many traits of the skull of ceratophryines are related to the capture of large prey independently of aquatic or terrestrial feeding. Herein, detailed descriptions of the development of hyoid skeleton and the anatomy of muscles responsible for hyoid and tongue movements in Lepidobatrachus laevis and L. llanensis are provided and compared with those of other neo-batrachians. The aquatic Lepidobatrachus has special features in its hyoid skeleton that integrates a set of derived features convergent with the conditions observed in non-neobatrachian anurans and morphological novelties (e.g., dorsal dermal hyoid ossification) that deviate from the generalized pattern found in most frogs. Further, reduction of fibers of muscles of buccal floor, reduction or loss of hyoid muscles (m. geniohyoideus rama lateralis, anterior pair of in. petrohyoideus posteriores), small tongue, and simplified tongue muscles are also morphological deviations from the pattern of terrestrial ceratophryines, and other aquatic ceratophryids (e.g., Telmatobius) that seem to be related to feeding underwater. The historical derived features shared with Chacophrys and Ceratophrys involved in megalophagy are conserved in Lepidobatrachus and morphological changes in the hyoglossal apparatus define a unique functional complex among anurans.

AB 1. Habitat heterogeneity has many implications in ecological assessment studies. On one hand it provides varying niches for organisms, increasing diversity. On the other hand, the inherent spatial variability of structurally complex systems may overlap with ecological condition making it difficult to disentangle the effects of perturbation. This study investigated the combined and single effects of habitat and pond condition on the macroinvertebrate assemblages of 35 ponds located in north-west Spain and spanning a range of water quality and habitat characteristics.
   2. Macroinvertebrate communities and several environmental variables were sampled in the summer of 2004 or 2003. Samples were collected from four dominant habitats (vegetated shores, shores without vegetation, submerged vegetation, bare sediments) following a time-limited sampling. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and two-way crossed ANOSIM were used to investigate the taxonomic and functional differences in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure among habitats (four types) and pond conditions (optimal, good, moderate, poor, very poor). To investigate the individual and combined effects of pond condition and habitat on several diversity measures GLM models were used. In addition, the accuracy of two sampling designs - stratified and multihabitat - was compared using the CVs of seven macroinvertebrate attributes.
   3. Results showed that macroinvertebrate communities differed significantly, albeit weakly, among habitat types and pond condition categories. In particular, the abundance of several Chironomidae genera., rarefied richness and Shannon index decreased both in perturbed systems and bare sediments, whereas no marked differences occurred between shores and submerged vegetation.
   4. We suggest that a multihabitat approach together with the use of community attributes not (or slightly) affected by habitat type will provide more comparable results across ponds than a stratified approach or observation of the whole community, especially in ponds where degradation leads to habitat loss.

AB This study examined the patterns of plant functional trait variation in relation to geomorphology, disturbance and a suite of other environmental factors in the riparian margin of the Upper Hunter River, New South Wales, Australia. Vegetation was surveyed on three geomorphic surfaces (point bar, bench and bank) along a 5.5-km stretch of the Upper Hunter River. Functional traits relating to plant growth and reproduction were collected for the identified species. anova and principal components analysis were used to compare the trait assemblages of species associated with each geomorphic unit. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to investigate trait variation with respect to environmental variables. There were clear differences in the plant functional trait assemblages associated with the three geomorphic units. Generally the point bar was associated with species that were herbaceous, with small seed mass, a short stature and a high specific leaf area (SLA). Conversely, the bench was associated with grasses that had unassisted seed dispersal and intermediate seed mass and SLA, while species on the bank had tall stature, large seed mass, a high SLA and a perennial life cycle. Variation along the primary gradient of plant functional trait composition was most strongly related to disturbance frequency and to a lesser extent soil nutrients and the proportion of clay and silt, while variation along the secondary gradient was associated with variation in substrate texture as well as soil nutrients.

AB In order to examine the role of environmental factors affecting foliar morphology, we performed a case study of leaf morphological variation of Ranunculus natans found in the arid zone of northwest China. We found that foliar phenotypic variation differed significantly between populations. We described substantial positive correlations between altitude and leaf area (LA) as well as leaf perimeter (LP), and also between longitude and number of teeth, along with dissection index (DI). The pH, conductivity, and salinity of the environment caused a significant decrease in both LA and LP. Ranked in terms of their impacts on leaf morphology, the six selected factors were: altitude > pH > conductivity > salinity > longitude > latitude. We found that foliar morphological variations are functional responses to water-quantity factors (e.g., altitude and longitude at regional scales) and water-availability relation factors (e.g., pH, conductivity, and salinity at local scales), rather than to temperature-relation factors (latitude). Therefore, altitude and longitude, along with pH, conductivity, and salinity, are the main factors that significantly influence foliar morphology in the arid zone of China. We found that main factors played major roles in plant phenotypic plasticity in a complex ecosystem, although different combinations and interactions of environmental and geographical factors in each local environment may obscure the general trends in trait changes along environmental gradients.

AB P>1. Reliable lotic ecological monitoring requires knowledge of river typology, environmental factors, the effect of stressors known here as 'pressures' and appropriate indicators of anthropogenically induced change. We sampled benthic macroinvertebrate, fish, bird and macrophyte communities along an intermittent Mediterranean river and analysed community structure (relative abundance) and function (metrics) relative to environmental and pressure gradients in order to identify suitable indicator group(s) for future monitoring and mitigation programmes.
   2. Principal components analysis revealed that scale-dependent longitudinal differences in valley form separated narrower higher lying sites and tributaries with good quality habitats from more open degraded sites lower down the river continuum on a small floodplain and large scale pressures describing changes in land use related to agriculture with associated physical bankside and channel impacts.
   3. Forward selection of variables in redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that reach scale environmental variables were selected more frequently than pressure variables for each organism group. Altitude and pH were highly redundant within and between groups, indicating essentially longitudinal structural and functional distribution patterns. Redundancy was far lower between selected pressure variables, but single or no pressure variables were retained for some organism groups indicating poor association of functional data, in particular, with the identified pressures. All RDA results indicated a longitudinal pH gradient, highlighting the combined effect of multiple environmental and pressure based mechanisms on organism groups.
   4. Large, mobile organisms such as fish and birds provided a reliable link between organism structure and function, environmental factors and physical disturbance of the channel, bankside and wider river corridor. Benthic macroinvertebrate and macrophyte structural data revealed distribution patterns in relation to water velocity, a key parameter for developing appropriate compensation measures.
   5. Results clearly show the importance of assessing patterns of both functional and structural change across multiple organism groups in order to identify typologically appropriate links with complex environmental and pressure gradients and develop and implement appropriate monitoring systems.

AB We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the influence of Daphnia infochemicals on growth rate, microcystin production, colony formation and cell size of eight Microcystis strains isolated from two lakes. The strains were characterized genetically by their 16S-23S rDNA ITS sequence. The experiment was composed of four treatments: (1) a control using filtered WC medium, (2) addition of Scenedesmus obliquus culture medium filtrate, (3) addition of Daphnia magna culture medium filtrate and (4) addition of sodium octyl sulphate, a commercially available Daphnia infochemical. Our results showed that sympatric strains differed strongly for the measured functional traits, while no correlations between traits were found. Between-strain differences in growth rate, microcystin production, colony formation and cell size were generally larger than the differences in phenotypes observed between treatments. Despite this, several strains reacted to the infochemicals by changing functional trait values. Daphnia culture medium filtrate and, to a lesser extent, sodium octyl sulphate had a negative influence on the growth rate of half of the strains and stimulated microcystin production in one strain, but the latter effect was not Daphnia-specific as Scenedesmus culture medium filtrate had the same effect. Daphnia culture medium filtrate also induced colony formation in one strain. Our data suggest that Daphnia infochemicals generally have a weak influence on growth rate, microcystin production and colony formation of Microcystis strains as compared to the inter-strain variability, while existing inducible effects are highly strain-specific.

AB Man-made ponds are often created to compensate for the loss and degradation of wetlands, but little is known about the processes taking place in these artificial environments, especially at a community level. The macrofaunal assemblage and water chemistry of newly created ponds in three nearby areas in the NE Iberian Peninsula were studied during the first year of life of these ponds in order to (i) detect if any invertebrate assemblage structure change was taking place, (ii) evaluate the effect of local factors on the invertebrate assemblage in each site, and (iii) compare the information obtained by taxonomic and functional approaches. Although invertebrate colonization was rapid, no relevant changes in assemblage parameters were related to time, implying that more time may be needed to detect successional changes in invertebrate assemblages. Local factors-especially those related to hydrological stability-produced notable differences both in the assemblage parameters and in the taxonomic and functional compositions of the invertebrate fauna. Finally, information provided by the functional approach was redundant with respect to that obtained by the classical taxonomic approach: in these newly created systems, the high dominance of a small number of taxa makes the functional approach a simple biological traits analysis of the few dominant species.

AB P>1. The structure and dynamics of prey populations are shaped by the foraging behaviours of their predators. Yet, there is still little documentation on how distinct predator foraging types control biodiversity, food-web architecture and ecosystem functioning.
   2. We experimentally compared the effects of model fish species of two major foraging types of lake planktivores: a size-selective visual feeder (bluegill), and a filter feeder (gizzard shad). The visual feeder forages on individually captured consumer prey, whereas the filter feeder forages on various prey simultaneously, not only consumers but also primary producers. We ran a 1-month mesocosm experiment cross-classifying a biomass gradient of each predator type. We analysed the effect of each fish on food-web architecture by computing major topological descriptors over time (connectance, link density, omnivory index, etc.). These descriptors were computed from 80 predator-prey binary matrices, using taxa mostly identified at the species level.
   3. We found that the visual feeder induced more trophic cul-de-sac (inedible) primary-producer species, lower link density and connectance, and lower levels of food-web omnivory and generalism than the filter feeder. Yet, predator biomass did not affect food-web topology.
   4. Our results highlight that top-predator foraging behaviour is a key functional trait that can drive food-web topology and ultimately ecosystem functioning.

AB P>The arrival order of colonists in developing populations can have a lasting influence on community and population structure, a phenomenon referred to as priority effects. To explore whether such priority effects are important in determining strain composition of populations of the cyanobacterium Microcystis, four Microcystis strains, isolated from a single lake and differing in functional traits, were grown during 4 weeks in the laboratory in all possible pairwise combinations, with the two strains either inoculated at the same time or with a time lag of 1 week, in the presence or absence of grazing Daphnia magna. The relative abundance of strains in the mixtures was assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and the growth rate of each strain in the mixtures was determined for the last 2 weeks of the experiment. We observed strong effects of inoculation order on the final population structure, and these effects were influenced by grazing Daphnia. The priority effects were strain-specific and occurred in two directions: some of the strains grew slower while others grew faster when inoculated second compared with when inoculated first. Our results indicate that priority effects may have a profound impact on strain composition of Microcystis populations.

AB The need for integrated and widely accessible Sources of species traits data to facilitate studies of ecology, conservation, and management has motivated development of traits databases for various tax-a. In spite of the increasing number of traits-based analyses of freshwater fishes in the United States, no consolidated database of traits of this group exists publicly, and much useful information on these species is documented only in obscure sources. The largely inaccessible and unconsolidated traits information makes large-scale analysis involving many fishes and/or traits particularly challenging We have compiled a database of > 100 traits for 809 (731 native and 78 normative) fish species found in freshwaters of the conterminous United states, including 37 native families and 145 native genera. The database, named FishTraits, contains information on four major categories of traits: (1) trophic ecology; (2) body size, reproductive ecology, and life history; (3) habitat preferences; and (4) salinity and temperature tolerances. Information on geographic distribution and conservation status was also compiled. The database enhances many opportunities for conducting research on fish species traits and constitutes the first step toward establishing a central repository for a continually expanding set of traits of North American fishes.

AB The ability to adaptively alter morphological, anatomical, or physiological functional traits to local environmental variations using external environmental cues is especially well expressed by all terrestrial and most aquatic plants. A ubiquitous cue eliciting these plastic phenotypic responses is mechanical perturbation (MP), which can evoke dramatic differences in the size, shape, or mechanical properties of conspecifics. Current thinking posits that MP is part of a very ancient "stress-perception response system" that involves receptors located at the cell membrane/cell wall interface capable of responding to a broad spectrum of stress-inducing factors. This hypothesis is explored here from the perspective of cell wall evolution and the control of cell wall architecture by unicellular and multicellular plants. Among the conclusions that emerge from this exploration is the perspective that the plant cell is phenotypically plastic.

AB The cockle Cerastoderma edule L. occurs at commercially exploited densities within both species-poor and species-rich assemblages, dominating the faunal biomass and potentially acting as a key contributor to a number of ecological functions. The questions considered were: Is the delivery of ecological functions affected by the removal of C. edule? Does the biodiversity of the affected assemblage affect the extent to which it is altered? To explore these questions, adult cockles were removed from experimental plots at two shores in the North-West of England: a species-poor shore at Warton Sands, Morecambe Bay, and a more diverse shore at Thurstaston, Dee estuary. Impacts on the functioning of the systems were determined during a 4-month study in summer 2007 by direct measurements of benthic primary production, organic matter content and sediment granulometry, and by indirect analyses using Biological Traits Analysis. Removal of adult cockles led to significant changes in faunal assemblage composition and in the distribution of biological traits, with increased biodiversity and an increased prevalence of traits relating to opportunistic taxa observed following the removal of C. edule. These changes occurred at both study sites and hence were independent of the initial biodiversity of the assemblages. Sediment granulometry was significantly affected; however, surface chlorophyll and organic matter were not affected. This implies a minimal impact on these functions and a high degree of functional redundancy within the macrofauna. The implications of these findings and future areas of research are discussed.

AB Hadrosaurid and ceratopsid dentaries display traits that suggest divergent functions toward broadly similar diets of fibrous plants. Computed tomographic scans of dentaries of a lambeosaurine and a centrosaurine (Centrosaurus aptertus) were used to compare feeding function of these animals using finite element analysis (FEA). In the hadrosaur, mediolateral expansion of the dentary and elongation of the coronoid process of the surangular were optimally developed to withstand torsion associated with transverse-isognathous jaw occlusion. FEA results strongly suggest longitudinal rotation of the hadrosaurid mandible. Mediolaterally compressed mandibles and FEA stress for the ceratopsid are in compliance with purely isognathous jaw adduction, although palinal retraction during the powerstroke cannot be ruled out. The ceratopsid dentary is further reinforced by a longitudinal ridge on the lateral surface of that element. Surface texture indicating Sharpey's fibers within the ceratopsid coronoid process suggests greater bite force than in lambeosaurines. These findings corroborate previous interpretations and suggest complementary or alternative kinematics to maxillary pleurokinesis in hadrosaurs. Anat Rec, 292:1338-1351, 2009.

AB Riparian and riverine systems around the world are subject to human mediated degradation. It is increasingly recognized that rehabilitation of these systems is important to retain biodiversity and important ecosystem services. Plant functional traits represent a potentially useful but underutilized tool in the restoration or rehabilitation of ecosystems such as riparian systems. This study uses a functional trait approach to provide insight into the changes in ecosystem function that have occurred with the loss of native plant species and their replacement by exotics. We examined the plant functional traits associated with extinct native, extant native and extant exotic species in the riparian mat-gin of the Hunter River, New South Wales, Australia. Comparisons of I I traits were conducted using univariate (analysis of variance and chi(2)) and multivariate (principal component analysis and analysis of similarity) methods. Both extant native and extant exotic species had traits associated with a short lived, ruderal strategy: high specific leaf area (SLA), soft leaves, herbaceous growth forms and therophyte life form. In contrast, extinct native species had traits such as low SLA, tough leaves, tree and shrub growth form and phanerophyte life form. This shift in plant trait assemblages associated with the transition from a native to predominately exotic flora has important implications for ecosystem processes in this riverine system. We suggest that such a functional trait approach can be integrated with knowledge of other ecosystem components to provide an understanding of ecosystem function that can be used to guide rehabilitation initiatives.

AB A key goal of functional ecology is identifying relationships between species traits and environmental conditions. Here, the nature and significance of these relationships to community composition on long ecological timescales is investigated using paleoecological and paleoenvironmental data from coastal British Columbia, Canada. RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, two three-table statistical techniques, are used to link traits of the region's dominant woody plants to environmental conditions over the last 15 000 calendar years (cal yr) through a fossil pollen record derived from lake sediments. Both RLQ and fourth-corner analyses revealed highly significant correlations between plant traits and temporal changes in environmental conditions. Axis 1 of the RLQ explained 92% of the total covariance between plant species traits and paleoenvironmental variables and was correlated most strongly with temperature and relative growth rate. In general, climate change during the cold period following deglaciation favored species such as Alnus sinuata and Pinus contorta that exhibit a "fast'' life-history strategy (e.g., high relative growth rate, short life span, low shade tolerance), whereas the relative climatic stability of the last 8000 cal yr favored species such as Tsuga heterophylla that exhibit a "slow'' life-history strategy (e.g., low relative growth rate, long life span, high shade tolerance). Fourth-corner analyses revealed significant correlations between all paleoenvironmental variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation, summer insolation, vegetation density) and most plant traits (relative growth rate, minimum seed-bearing age, seed mass, height, life span, and shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerances). The strongest correlation was between paleotemperature and height, reflecting the positive effect of temperature on plant growth and development and the overarching competitive advantage that height confers. This research demonstrates that environmental conditions interact significantly with life-history and stress tolerance traits over long ecological timescales to determine forest composition. Climate is the ultimate control on postglacial forest composition and species abundances, but long-term community assembly is also constrained through interspecific differences in plant traits.

AB The relationship of functional diversity and composition was studied in gradients of organically enriched sediments from four Mediterranean fish farms. Within-functional trait diversity was also used to examine the functional redundancy of specific functional traits. Characteristics considered to respond to different geochemical conditions of the sediment were chosen for the traits list of that organism and were classified into ecological and morphological traits. Each trait was split up into several categories chosen to encompass the range of possible attributes of all species. The abundance of species possessing the same code was summed for each sample. Functional codes analyses differentiated between the sediment types and the TOC states, confirming the sensitivity of the functional characteristics to the geochemistry of the sediment. Changes in species number and abundance in the compared sites determined the shifts of the functional processes and not the presence or absence of individual traits. The important functional codes for the homogeneity within the examined habitats were fewer in the disturbed areas indicating that the functioning of these ecosystems is significantly reduced.

AB 1. Characterisation of biodiversity is typically based on taxonomic approaches, while much less is known about other related aspects. Functional trait diversity is one such component of biodiversity that has not been addressed rigorously in ecological research until recently. We tested the congruence between taxonomic- and trait-based approaches, and examined how spatial configuration, local abiotic environmental factors and biotic effects interact to influence taxonomic- and trait-based characterisation of freshwater fish assemblages.
   2. Fish assemblage data were compiled for 124 lakes in southern Finland. Variance partitioning in both linear regression analyses and redundancy analysis was used to quantify the relative contribution of spatial and environmental variables to taxonomic and functional trait diversity and structure. Additionally, a null model analysis was used to test for the potential effects of interspecific segregation and biotic interactions on the co-occurrence of species.
   3. The species pool was relatively poor. However, trait-based classification of species indicated that most species belonged to unique functional entities, which suggested low redundancy in species composition. Correlation analysis indicated a very strong relationship between species richness (SR) and the number of unique trait combinations (UTC). Ecoregion-level heterogeneity in SR and UTC were well represented in a relatively small group of randomly selected lakes (c. 30 lakes). Multiple regressions indicated moderate roles for abiotic environmental variables (i.e. lake surface area, depth, total phosphorous, colour and pH) in determining SR, UTC and the distribution of single trait categories, whereas geographical location was not generally influential.
   4. Redundancy analysis revealed similar patterns to those of diversity analyses for taxonomic and associated trait-based structure, emphasising the effect of abiotic environmental variables and the negligible effect of geographical position.
   5. Co-occurrence analysis indicated significant checkerboard distribution at the whole assemblage level, but interspecific segregation proved to be of relatively minor importance in the constrained analyses, where species pair combinations within trait category groups were evaluated.
   6. Our results suggest that taxonomic- and trait-based patterns of boreal lake fish assemblages are strongly interrelated. Environmental filtering through the effects of local abiotic variables seems to have the most prominent role in determining trait-based assemblage patterns among lakes, which may also be secondarily shaped by biotic interactions.
   7. From the applied perspective, it may not necessarily matter whether traditional taxonomic or more novel trait-based approaches are used in characterising spatial patterns in boreal fish assemblages. However, trait-based approaches may provide complementary information which cannot be directly revealed by taxonomic data.

AB Differences in feeding behavior and performance among the five native Hawaiian gobioid stream fishes (Sicyopterus stimpsoni, Lentipes concolor, Awaous guamensis, Stenogobius hawaiiensis, and Eleotris sandwicensis) have been proposed based on the skeletal anatomy of their jaws and dietary specialization. However, performance of the feeding apparatus likely depends on the proportions and configurations of the jaw muscles and the arrangement of the jaw skeleton. We used a published mathematical model of muscle function to evaluate potential differences in jaw closing performance and their correlations with morphology among these species. For example, high output force calculated for the adductor mandibulae muscles (A2 and A3) of both A. guamensis and E. sandwicensis matched expectations based on the morphology of these species because these muscles are larger than in the other species. In contrast, Stenogobius hawaiiensis exhibited an alternative morphological strategy for achieving high relative output forces of both A2 and A3, in which the placement and configuration of the muscles conveyed high mechanical advantage despite only moderate cross-sectional areas. These differing anatomical pathways to similar functional performance suggest a pattern of many-to-one mapping of morphology to performance. In addition, a functional differentiation between A2 and A3 was evident for all species, in which A2 was better suited for producing forceful jaw closing and A3 for rapid jaw closing. Thus, the diversity of feeding performance of Hawaiian stream gobies seems to reflect a maintenance of functional breadth through the retention of some primitive traits in combination with novel functional capacities in several species.

AB Evolutionary transitions between different environmental media such as air and water pose special problems with respect to skin permeability because of the dramatic changes in the driving gradients and nature of water exchange processes. Also, during the transitional periods prior to complete adaptation to a new medium, the skin is exposed to two very different sets of environmental conditions. Here, we report new data for transepidermal evaporative water loss (TEWL) and cutaneous resistance to evaporative water loss (R-s) of sea snakes that are transitional in the sense of being amphibious and semi-terrestrial. We investigated three species of sea kraits (Elapidae: Laticaudinae) that are common to Orchid Island (Lanyu), Taiwan. Generally, R-s of all three species is lower than that characteristic of terrestrial/xeric species of snakes measured in other taxa. Within Laticauda, R-s is significantly greater (TEWL lower) in the more terrestrial species and lowest (TEWL highest) in the more aquatic species. Previously reported losses of water from snakes kept in seawater exhibit a reversed trend, with lower rates of loss in the more aquatic species. These data suggest selection for adaptive traits with respect to increasing exposure to the marine environment. Thus, a countergradient of traits is reflected in decreased TEWL in aerial environments and decreased net water efflux in marine environments, acting simultaneously in the three species. The pattern for TEWL correlates with ultrastructural evidence for increased lipogenesis in the stratum corneum of the more terrestrial species. The skin surfaces of all three species are hydrophobic. Species differences in this property possibly explain the pattern for water efflux when these snakes are in seawater, which remains to be investigated.

AB Population regulation in pond-breeding amphibians has generally been assumed to occur through density dependence in the aquatic larval stage. However, studies examining terrestrial stage population dynamics are comparatively rare. As a consequence, the relative importance of density dependence In the terrestrial stage remains largely unknown. Here I determine the density dependence of terrestrial stage vital rates, including juvenile and adult survival, age and size at first reproduction, and reproductive traits, for a population of Wood Frogs, Rana sylvatica, in Michigan. I also examine the carry-over effects of density-dependent variation in metamorphic traits on adult demographic traits. During the 21 years of this study, the number of breeding adult males and females varied by an order of magnitude, whereas the number of metamorphic juveniles leaving the pond varied by two orders of magnitude. Adult male and female annual survival was negatively correlated with the number of males and females, respectively. Partial correlation coefficients (holding population size of the opposite sex, number of juveniles, and precipitation levels constant) indicated that variation in adult male and female survival was largely explained by variation in the number of males and females, respectively. Juvenile survival (both males and females) was strongly negatively correlated with juvenile population size but not juvenile body size, adult population size, or total precipitation. Partial correlations revealed that variation in juvenile population size was the single most important factor accounting for variation in male and female juvenile survival, and female age and size at first reproduction. Clutch size and egg size also varied with juvenile population size independent of female body size. At lower juvenile population sizes, female juveniles matured earlier, at a larger body size, and produced larger numbers of smaller eggs than at high juvenile population sizes. Although juvenile body size was positively correlated with male and female reproductive body size and total clutch weight, juvenile fitness traits, in general, were more closely related to variation in juvenile population sizes. Larval traits did not affect adult fitness traits in the terrestrial stage. A nonlinear logistic model best described the functional relationship between juvenile population size and the number of surviving males, females, and total adult biomass. As number of juveniles produced increased, the number of surviving adult males, females, and total biomass plateaued, suggesting that the terrestrial environment limited adult population size. My results demonstrate that density-dependent effects operating in the terrestrial stage may be important in regulating Wood Frog population size.

AB A plant species' ecology is associated with leaf economics, characterized, e.g., by photosynthetic rate, construction costs, and leaf life span. Specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area per leaf dry mass) is often considered to be a key trait in this respect, explaining interspecific variation in leaf economics. TO understand factors constraining the specific leaf area, we investigated size-related biomechanical constraints of the traits that determine the SLA-leaf thickness, leaf dry matter content and leaf density-and the constraints these traits exert on each other among, 33 herbaceous wetland species of northern Ontario with a wide variety of leaf forms. ranging from wide laminar leaves to long, narrow, and relatively thick columnar leaves. Data from garden experiments were compared with field data. The results agree with biomechanical predictions that lamina thickness and leaf dry matter content are positively and leaf density (fresh mass per volume) negatively associated with leaf length. The traits also constrain each other, but these intertrait relationships are confounded by interspecific variation in leaf length. We conclude that for a full understanding of the adaptive significance of leaf structural design, it is essential to include leaf size in the considerations.

AB Although many species face numerous predators in nature, the combined impact of multiple predators on the inducible defenses of prey has rarely been studied. Prey may respond with an intermediate phenotype that balances the risk from several sources or may simply respond to the most dangerous predator. I examined the separate and combined effects of the presence of shell-breaking (crabs, Cancer productus) and shell-entry (seastars, Pisaster ochraceus) predators fed conspecific snails on the defensive shell morphology and antipredator behavior of a marine snail (Nucella lamellosa). When exposed to each feeding predator separately, snails responded with a combination of morphological defenses that reflect the attack mode of the predator and a generalized behavioral response. Snails responded to feeding crabs by increasing refuge use and producing a thick, rotund shell. Snails responded to feeding seastars with increased refuge use but produced elongate shells with high spires that allowed for greater retraction of the soft tissue. Seastar-induced phenotypes reduced susceptibility to seastars relative to crab-induced phenotypes, but crab-induced phenotypes did not significantly reduce susceptibility to crabs, indicating an asymmetrical functional trade-off. When feeding predators were combined, snails produced a morphological phenotype similar to that expressed in the presence of the predator that imposed the highest mortality at the population level, suggesting that predator-induced morphology was prioritized according to predation risk. These results suggest that prioritizing conflicting defenses according to predator danger may be a common strategy for prey responding to combined predators, particularly in conjunction with generalized behavioral responses that reduce overall risk in multiple-predator environments.

AB The external morphology of frog larvae is predicted to vary among habitats, for a variety of functional reasons. I performed a phylogenetic comparative study to test whether correlations between habitat and the shape of the tadpole and its oral disc are adaptive in 82 species from south-eastern Australia in the families Hylidae and Myobatrachidae. Habitat distributions and phylogenetic relationships were compiled from the literature and shape was quantified using geometric morphometric analysis of published drawings. Results indicate that shape evolved towards different optima in different habitats while also showing appreciable levels of phylogenetic inertia. Within myobatrachids, evolution of terrestrial tadpoles was associated with a short and shallow head/body and a shallow tail. In aquatic species, the use of benthic microhabitats was correlated with a long shallow tail, dorsal eye position, shallow head/body and ventral mouth with robust jaw sheaths. Even traits with evidence for adaptation evolved slowly in response to habitat shifts, usually requiring >= 10 million years to evolve half-way to a new optimum. Although these findings support adaptive evolution of tadpole body form, they also highlight a strong influence of ancestral character states and indicate that phenotypes in extant species are partly maladaptive.

AB Crabtree Creek, a relatively shallow stream in Wake County, North Carolina is a major tributary of the Neuse River, which has historically received much attention with regards to water quality and health concerns within the state. We undertook a preliminary survey of Crabtree Creek in an effort to assess the water quality and determine the ecological integrity of this drainage system. Data were obtained during spring, fall, and winter at seven sites along the creek. The substrate ranged from boulder to cobble, gravel, and sand with moderate to heavy sedimentation at many sites. Dissolved oxygen was not considered stressful to organisms, except at one location, and most chemical parameters fell within normal ranges. Coliform bacteria, detected at all locations, were especially high in four of the seven study sites. Overall, taxa diversity and richness were low, and the invertebrate community included few ephemeropterans, plecopterans, and trichopterans but had many other pollution-tolerant species. Depending upon the site and season, the biotic index suggested water quality ranged from very good to very poor.

AB Community concordance describes similarity in distributions and abundances of organisms from different taxonomic groups across a region of interest, with highly concordant communities assumed to respond similarly to major environmental gradients, including anthropogenic stressors. While few studies have explicitly tested for concordance among stream-dwelling organisms, it frequently is assumed that both macroinvertebrates and fish respond in concert to environmental factors, an assumption that has implications for their management. We investigated concordance among fish and macroinvertebrates from tributaries of two catchments in southeastern Michigan having varied landscape characteristics. Classifications of fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages resulted in groups distinguished by differences in taxonomic characteristics, functional traits, and stressor tolerance of their respective dominant taxa. Biological groups were associated with principal landscape gradients of the study region, which ranged from forests and wetlands on coarse surficial geology to agricultural lands on finer, more impervious surficial geology. Measures of stream habitat indicated more stable stream flows and greater heterogeneity of conditions at site groups with catchments comprising forests and wetlands on the coarsest geology, but did not distinguish well among remaining site groups, suggesting that habitat degradation may not be the driving mechanism leading to differences in groups. Despite broadly similar interpretations of relationships of site groups with landscape characteristics for both fish and macroinvertebrates, examination of site representation within groups indicated weak community concordance. Our results suggest that explicit responses of fish and macroinvertebrates to landscape factors vary, due to potential differences in their susceptibility to controls or to differences in the scale at which landscape factors influence these organisms.

AB Selecting indicators of the response of the benthic community to fishing effort restrictions is important for testing the efficacy of management actions that seek to minimise ecosystem degradation. Components of epifaunal communities are sensitive to trawling, and concordant measurements of trawling effort can be used to establish a link between response and impact variables. Trawling effort on Mediterranean fishing grounds can be assessed, but the lack of data from communities inhabiting these areas makes establishing the response-impact relationship difficult. This study addresses this challenge by investigating benthic communities from the NW Mediterranean subjected to a gradient of fishing effort, and confirms that indicators based on functional components of epibenthos can be a useful tool to describe the response of communities to disturbance across habitat types.

AB The development of ecosystem-based indicators requires the broadening of a view of the community, from fish species to all the species (macrobenthic and fish) correctly captured by a given sampling gear. Many scientific surveys already have such integrated databases. The present note aims to demonstrate that existing databases, herein from dedicated coastal nursery surveys, are actually underexploited. Such databases contain information on non-commercial taxa, which could greatly improve our knowledge on the organisation and functioning of coastal ecosystems. Using two datasets, a "complete" dataset composed of commercial and not-commercial epibenthic trawled species (fish and invertebrate) and a "subset" dataset characterized by commercial and routinely surveyed species (mainly fish and cephalopods), different measures of functional diversity are compared to identify the functional gains of including epibenthic species. The results show that, when included in the analyses. epibenthic taxa provide gains of functional information, associated mainly with the community feeding traits, i.e. organisms composing the primary and secondary consumer levels of the coastal nursery food web. Failure to include some of the primary (zooplanktivores and suspension feeders) and secondary consumers (detritivores-scavengers) in coastal survey analyses may, for instance, hamper our understanding of energy flux between the benthic and water column compartments of these ecosystems. The results also suggest that the exclusion of some taxa associated with these two food web compartments, may lead to the underestimation of the functional redundancy in coastal ecosystems.

   SYMMORIIFORMES), WITH COMMENTS ON DORSAL FIN MODULARITY
SO JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY
DT Article
ID FISHES
AB A bizarre "spine-brush complex" is found only in extinct symmoriiform chondrichthyans (Order Symmoriiformes). Its structural complexity makes the spine-brush complex a rich source of morphological characters for phylogenetic analysis, and it has been used as a basis for their family-level subdivision. Development of the complex is sex-linked in one of the three symmoriiform families customarily recognized (Falcatidae), but its distribution within members of the other two families (Symmoriidae, Stethacanthiclae) is poorly documented. Consequently, earlier family-level diagnoses (which were largely based on the presence or absence of the spine-brush complex) are probably misleading. Some features of the spine-brush complex can be homologized with structures found in "normal" shark dorsal fins, suggesting that the spine-brush complex is a highly specialized first dorsal fin. The spine-brush complex may have arisen by co-option of the first dorsal fin module, possibly involving its suppression in females and postdisplacement (delayed development) in males, plus acquisition of several apomorphic traits, unlike in chimaeroids and actinistians where co-option of the first dorsal fin module is not sex-linked or developmentally postdisplaced. The evolutionary history of dorsal fin modularity is examined. In gnathostomes. co-option is typically confined to the first module, whereas the second is more highly conserved, retaining its functional role in aquatic locomotion.

AB Functional diversity is regarded as a key in understanding the link between ecosystem function and biodiversity, but its measurement is rather problematic. The two widely used continuous measures are the dendrogram-based measure (DBM) and the functional attribute diversity (FAD). In contrast to DBM, FAD does not require the knowledge of the entire species pool before the analysis, and hence FAD is a more ideal tool for measuring functional diversity. However, the original form of FAD and its variants have several undesirable properties. Here, we suggest a modified FAD (denoted by MFAD), which-as illustrated by artificial and actual data sets-allows calculating functional diversity without violating the twinning and monotonicity criteria such that the number of species collected is compensated for. These requirements are met by replacing the original species by so-called functional species and then by dividing FAD by the number of functional units. Accordingly, MFAD measures the dispersion of species in the functional traits space so that MFAD values for different communities can directly be compared if the same set of functional traits is used. Finally, using data of two freshwater communities (caddisfly and riverine fish), we evaluate the change of species richness and functional diversity in relation to sampling effort (sample unit size). We found that functional diversity is a better and more reliable community descriptor than species richness in a sense that it converges to the maximum faster in the function of sampling effort.

AB To increase the generality of biodiversity-ecosystem function theory, studies must be expanded to include real communities in a variety of systems. We modified J. W. Fox's approach to partition the influence of species richness on standing crop biomass ( net biodiversity effect) of 21 freshwater mussel communities into trait-independent complementarity, trait-dependent complementarity ( species with particular traits dominate without impacting other species), and dominance effects ( species with particular traits dominate at the expense of others). Overall, species-rich mussel communities have greater biomass than predicted based on average biomass across the region. This effect is largely due to trait-independent complementarity with less abundant species having higher body condition and reduced metabolic rates in species-rich communities. These measures are positively correlated with spatial and temporal thermal variation, suggesting that use of thermal niches as habitat may be important to species coexistence and performance, and emphasizing that knowledge of species traits and environmental context are important to understanding biodiversity ecosystem function dynamics.

AB Deep-sea pelagic diversity is poorly understood. Local (SL) and regional (SR) ichthyonekton species richness are presented and analysed with respect to local and regional environmental factors, and biogeographical processes.
   Sixty-six stations from the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent sector of the Southern Ocean, 65 degrees N to 57 degrees S.
   Estimation of SL by means of rarefaction. Stepwise evaluation of SL and SR relationships by means of the second-order corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) after locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) and linear fitting, analysis of saturation effects by means of slopes of species accumulation curves (log-log plots).
   Latitudinal gradients were present for SL and SR, and were asymmetric between the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Relatively low species richness was encountered for the Southern Ocean. Asymmetry at the regional level by means of higher SR was attributed to area effects in the South Atlantic. Log-log plots indicated saturation of local assemblages and dependence on environmental factors. SL was related to productivity; this relationship was hump-shaped. SR was positively related to area size and negatively to seasonality of production. Biogeographical effects were indicated in that SR peaks coincided with overlap zones of boreal and tropical faunas as a consequence of historical faunal exchange processes.
   The stepwise approach allowed for distinction between effects of area size, productivity and biogeographical processes on diversity at local and regional scales. Productivity in particular is important in two ways. At the local scale, the link of productivity to SL is explained by a successional-functional hypothesis of resource utilization, whereas the seasonality effect for SR reinforces the hypothesis of dependence of deep-sea fishes on seasonality of production through changes of life-history traits. The causes of low Antarctic faunal diversity remained unresolved.

AB Channel reconfiguration is a popular but controversial approach to river restoration, and ecological responses to channel reconfiguration have not been rigorously assessed. We compared physical-habitat variables, taxonomic and functional-trait diversities, taxonomic composition, and functional-trait abundances between 24 pairs of upstream (control) and downstream reconfigured (restored) reaches in 3 catchment land uses (urban, agricultural, rural) across the North Carolina Piedmont. We asked how environmental filters and functional species traits might provide insight to biological responses to restoration. Taxonomic and functional-trait differences between control and restored reaches suggest that restoration affected aquatic assemblages only in agricultural and rural catchments. Our results highlight 2 important aspects of channel reconfiguration as a restoration practice. First, responses to restoration differ between agricultural/rural and urban catchments, possibly because of modified hydrological regimes caused by urbanization. Second, we find evidence that channel reconfiguration disturbs food and habitat resources in stream ecosystems. Taxa sensitive to disturbance were characteristic of control reaches, whereas insensitive taxa were characteristic of restored reaches. Abundances of traits related to reproduction (voltinism, development, synchronization of emergence, adult life span), mobility (occurrence in drift, maximum crawling rate, swimming ability), and use of resources (trophic and habitat preferences) differed significantly between control and recently restored reaches. Our results suggest that taxa in restored habitats are environmentally selected for traits favored in disturbed environments. Our work suggests how functional-trait approaches could benefit the practice of river restoration when used to target restoration activities and to develop informed expectations regarding recovery following restoration activities.
